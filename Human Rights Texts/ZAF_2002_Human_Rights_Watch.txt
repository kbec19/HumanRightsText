SOUTH AFRICA
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
President Thabo Mbeki led a government dominated by the African National
Congress (ANC), though the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) remained a junior partner.
Apparently reflecting divisions within the ruling party,Minister for Safety and
Security Steve Tshwete announced in April that the police would investigate bizarre
allegations of a conspiracy against the president led by three prominent members
of the ANC. The Congress of South African Trades Unions (COSATU) and many
other commentators expressed concern about the use of state resources for political
purposes. Tensions within the tripartite alliance of the ANC, COSATU, and the
South African Communist Party (SACP) also increased on other fronts during the
year. In August, COSATU staged a two-day general strike in protest at the government’s
policies of privatization. A major investigation into corruption in relation
to government arms purchases led to the arrest of former ANC chief whip Tony
Yengeni in October; other arrests were expected. Later that month, the opposition Democratic Alliance split into its constituent parts, the Democratic Party and the
New National Party (NNP), provoked by clashes between the parties in the Western
Cape.An alliance between the ANC and the NNP (a reincarnation of the party
of government between 1948 and 1994) was mooted.
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) continued hearing applications
for amnesty until May 31,when its work was formally ended.The mandate of
the TRC itself was extended only to complete the final two volumes of its report.
The government stated that legislation setting the framework for reparations to the
victims would be introduced to parliament in 2002. Also wrapping up business
from the past, the trial of Wouter Basson, a chemical weapons expert with the old
South African army, continued throughout 2001.
In November 2000, South Africa ratified the treaty to establish an International
Criminal Court; legislation to bring it into effect domestically was introduced to
parliament in July 2001. The Promotion of Access to Information Act came into
effect in March 2001, adding flesh to the constitutional right to access government
and privately held information. The Protected Disclosure Act, designed to shield
“whistle-blowers,” came into effect February. Among notable decisions, the Constitutional
Court ruled in May that the South African government’s deportation to
the U.S. ofMohamed Khalfan, a suspect in the 1998 bombing of the U.S. embassies
in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, was unlawful. The court found that South Africa
should have sought assurances from the U.S. government that Khalfan would not
be subject to the death penalty.
In July, there were scenes uncomfortably reminiscent of the past when the government
evicted squatters from land outside Johannesburg who had been “sold”
plots by the opposition Pan Africanist Congress (PAC). In response to these developments,
and land invasions taking place in Zimbabwe, the Democratic Alliance
joined with the PAC in demanding a national debate on South Africa’s land reform
program.
Torture and ill-treatment of criminal suspects by the police remained a serious
problem. The Independent Complaints Directorate (ICD), set up in 1997 to investigate
or oversee the investigation of complaints against the police, reported 650
deaths in custody or as a result of police action during the year to March 2001, a
slight decrease on the previous year. The number of complaints lodged with the
ICD increased by 11 percent, to 4,863. Encouragingly, the ICD reported that there
had been a decrease in allegations of torture. In November 2000, a booklet titled
“The ABC of Human Rights and Policing,” produced with funding from the Danish
Embassy, was launched and distributed among police officers.
In July,Minister Tshwete announced that the government intended to increase
the size of the police force from 121,000 to 127,000 over the next three years. In May,
the minister announced progress in carrying out a review of police collection of
crime statistics, and that publication of those statistics, suspended since July 2000,
would be resumed at the end of the third quarter of 2001. Trial projects to establish
“community safety forums”were launched in the Western Cape, involving all sectors
of government in improving safety and security, and not only the police. In
January 2001, it was announced that all specialized units within the police would
be phased out, and their personnel redeployed to priority crime units at local police stations. New metropolitan police forces were launched in Johannesburg and
Tshwane (the greater Pretoria area).
In February 2001, the first of sixty planned government-funded legal assistance
centers opened in Benoni, outside Johannesburg. A new management team was
installed at the Legal Aid Board in the same month, leading to hopes that the
improvements since Mohammed Navsa took over as chairman of the board would
continue. In October, the board announced a range of cooperative agreements
aimed at improving access to legal services among the poor.However, a backlog of
court cases continued to plague the system despite government initiatives to clear
it, contributing to the crisis of overcrowding in prisons. Following several strikes,
large increases in pay to prosecutors were awarded in July, backdated to January.
The office of the National Director for Public Prosecutions (NDPP) and its elite
crime fighting unit known as the Scorpions, carried out investigations of high priority
crimes; tensions between the Scorpions and the regular police were reported.
At the end of 2000, South Africa’s prisons held 160,003 people, a slight fall on the
previous year; approved prison accommodation grew from 99,834 to 101,991, and
four additional prisons were under construction. In March 2001, the minister of
correctional services signed a contract with a private company, the Ikwezi Consortium,
to design, build, and operate a maximum security prison in Bloemfontein,
the first such contract in South Africa.More than 55,000 of those being held were
awaiting trial, of whom almost 13,000 had been locked up for more than six
months.More than 4,000 were under eighteen years of age; legislation and practical
measures to improve the situation of children charged with violent crimes was
still not in place. By April 2001, the total prison population had risen again to
172,000, of whom 64,000 were awaiting trial, according to a report to parliament by
Inspecting Judge Johannes Fagan. Draft legislation aimed at improving the parole
system was tabled in Parliament in February 2001.Assaults on prisoners by warders
and other prisoners remained serious problems, including widespread prisoneron-
prisoner rape: a spokesperson for the inspecting judge estimated that 70 to 80
percent of all suspects were sodomized by fellow prisoners before they were even
officially charged. In October 2000, it was revealed that AIDS-related deaths in
South African prisons had increased by 300 percent from 1995 to 1999. The doctor
in charge of medical services for prisoners in Cape Town’s Pollsmoor prison stated
that conditions in the prison represented a health hazard for the Western Cape.
In November, legislation was approved by parliament to regulate South Africa’s
private security industry, long plagued with allegations of abuse.Vigilante violence
remained a serious problem, with groups such as People Against Gangsterism and
Drugs (PAGAD) and Mapogo a Mathamaga responsible for beatings and execution-
style murders. A witness due to testify in a trial of PAGAD members was shot
dead in April. “Taxi violence” between rival operators of minibus taxis continued;
reports implicated members of the police in this violence. In KwaZulu-Natal, long
standing tensions between the ANC and IFP broke out into violence at different
times. In May, a workshop organized by the Parliamentary Participation Unit in
rural KwaZulu-Natal was disrupted by a group of thirty-five IFP supporters who
claimed that the unit had not gained IFP consent to hold the meeting in their
area.
Violence against women and girls, including sexual violence, remained a very
serious problem. Human Rights Watch published a report in March concluding
that rape and other sexual violence were part of the normal environment for girls
in schools, as well as in the wider community. In September 2001, a report from the
Eastern Cape legislature’s standing committee on education detailed horrific abuse
by teachers at the province’s schools. In March, the ICD reported for the first time
to parliament on its duties to monitor the implementation by police of the Domestic
Violence Act, and noted serious deficiencies at many police stations. In August,
National Police Commissioner Jackie Selebi said that violence against women was a
priority crime for the police, but that the Domestic Violence Act was effectively not
enforceable. In August, the Constitutional Court handed down an important decision
ruling that the state’s duty to protect the security of women could form the
basis of a case for damages. The case considered involved a woman who had been
raped by a man out on bail on charges of attempting to rape another woman; it was
referred back to the High Court for rehearing on the facts.The Recognition of Customary
Marriages Act came into effect in November 2000, bringing the protection
of the law to people in such unions. In the same month,Molo Songololo, an NGO,
launched a report on the trafficking of children within South Africa for the purposes
of sexual exploitation, identifying this as a serious but unquantified problem
to which the state response was wholly inadequate.Another study,published in January
2001, suggested that child poverty was increasing, contributing to children’s
vulnerability to such exploitation. In August, the Pretoria High Court ruled that
sections of the Sexual Offences Act banning prostitution were unconstitutional.
Violence on commercial farms—documented in an August Human Rights
Watch report—remained a high profile issue. Commercial farmers, highly vulnerable
to violent crime, called for greater security force protection, while organizations
representing farm workers denounced assaults on farm workers. In October,
the government held a conference on rural safety, focusing on several aspects of
crime in commercial farming areas. In the same month, commercial farmers in the
Western Cape launched a code of conduct committing farmers to promoting
“decent livelihoods” for their workers.
Widespread xenophobia led to violence against foreigners on several occasions,
including attacks on Zimbabweans resident in a squatter camp in Gauteng in October,
in which seventy-four shacks were gutted by fire.Police were deployed to patrol
the settlement. In May, the Department of Home Affairs agreed to withdraw a
directive to immigration officers to refuse asylum to applicants who had transited
a “safe” third country before reaching South Africa, in a settlement following a
court application by the NGO Lawyers for Human Rights. In the same month, the
department began to issue new identity documents to refugees, in accordance with
the 1998 Refugees Act. In June, the department was defeated in court, when the
Constitutional Court upheld the High Court’s declaration that two sections of the
existing Aliens Control Act relating to applications for work permits for foreign
spouses of South African citizens were unconstitutional. In June, the department
tabled in parliament a new draft of a long-awaited Immigration Bill; but by November
it had yet to make any progress.
In April, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers’ Association of South Africa withdrew a case from the Pretoria High Court that it had brought against the government
to strike down legislative provisions that would allow the government to produce
or import anti-retroviral drugs at low cost.However, the government did not
go on to announce any plans to make such drugs available in public hospitals. The
government also opposed in court a legal challenge brought by the Treatment
Action Campaign (TAC) to require the government to supply in the public health
sector anti-retroviral drugs to prevent mother-to-child transmission. President
Mbeki continued to question the link between HIV and AIDS, but spoke less on the
subject than in previous years. In October, a report by the Medical Research Council
was published, indicating that in 2000, 40 percent of adult deaths and 25 percent
of total deaths in South Africa were HIV-related, thus contradicting a statement by
President Mbeki that violence was the main cause of death.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
South Africa’s vigorous human rights community continued to monitor adherence
to national and international standards. Occasional government hostility to
NGO criticism was counteracted by strong collaboration in government-NGO
partnerships elsewhere. The constitutionally mandated South African Human
Rights Commission (SAHRC) criticized the government for often ignoring its recommendations.
The commission took a high profile on issues related to racism,
including in programs related to the World Conference Against Racism, held in
Durban, in August and September. In July, it announced a major investigation into
human rights violations on commercial farms. In May, a new set of commissioners
joined the Commission on Gender Equality (CGE), also established by constitutional
mandate. In August, the CGE hosted a national gender summit.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
South Africa’s pivotal position in the continent was underlined during the year
by several high profile visits to South Africa by foreign leaders (including Japanese
Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, during the first visit by a Japanese head of government
to sub-Saharan Africa), and President Mbeki’s involvement in a number of
key initiatives, including the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)
launched at the OAU summit in July. In October, South Africa deployed seven hundred
soldiers to Burundi, as part of a peacekeeping force to protect the transitional
government. In August and September, South Africa hosted the World Conference
Against Racism.
United States
Outgoing Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited South Africa in December
2000, as did her successor Colin Powell in May 2001. In June 2001 President
Mbeki visited the U.S., his second visit as head of state, and met with President Bush. The two leaders reaffirmed “excellent ties” between the two countries and
signed treaties related to the fight against international crime, including on extradition.
However, the U.S./South Africa bi-national commission set up under President
Clinton was scrapped. Following the September 11 attacks, South Africa
stated that it would cooperate with U.S. efforts to bring the culprits to justice, but
that any action taken should be based on “thorough investigation and incontrovertible
evidence.”
The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) program for South
Africa funded projects worth U.S. $46.68 million to South Africa in 2000, and projected
spending $50 million in 2001. The critical areas for funding in 2001 identified
in a December 2000 declaration on development assistance included job
creation, the criminal justice system, HIV/AIDS, education, and small business
development.
European Union
Several European heads of government visited South Africa during the year. In
these and other discussions, E.U. member states indicated their commitment to
NEPAD, and reliance on South Africa as leader in the region.
The E.U. Foundation for Human Rights in South Africa continued funding
human rights projects, with funds from the European Commission’s Program for
Reconstruction and Development in South Africa. The E.U. remained South
Africa’s largest donor, having given an average 125 million euro per year for development
since 1994. Individual E.U. member states also made bilateral contributions
to human rights initiatives.
Britain in particular continued its close ties to South Africa. In June, President
Mbeki visited the U.K. for meetings with Prime Minister Tony Blair and other ministers,
including a meeting of the U.K.-South Africa bilateral forum. Blair and
Mbeki published a joint article committing resources to development in Africa.
The presence of the British Military Advisory and Training Team (BMATT) in
South Africa was extended to 2003.
