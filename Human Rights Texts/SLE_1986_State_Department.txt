 SIERRA LEONE
 Sierra Leone has a one-party system of government with the
 President exercising predominant executive authority. The
 1978 Constitution, approved in a national referendum,
 established the All People's Congress (APC) as the sole legal
 party and extended the term of then-President Siaka Probyn
 Stevens until 1985. (Stevens first assumed executive power in
 1976 following two military coups.) Stevens handpicked Major
 General Joseph Saidu Momoh, then Sierra Leone Military Force
 Commander, as his successor, and Momoh was confirmed as
 President in a national referendum on October 1, 1985.
 Parliamentary elections were held in May 1986. All candidates
 in the 105 constituencies were officially sanctioned by the
 party, but as many as 5 were permitted to run in each district.
 The government security structure, which includes the police,
 the military forces, and a Special Security Division (SSD),
 does not generally interfere with the rights of individuals.
 Certain army units were accused of trying to force merchants
 to sell rice at fixed government prices in 1985, but there was
 no repetition of such charges in 1986.
 Sierra Leone is considered by the United Nations to be among
 the world's least developed countries. About 70 percent of
 its 3.9 million population is engaged in agriculture, mainly
 at the subsistence level. The Constitution recognizes the
 right to own private property. Most of the modern sector of
 the economy is privately owned, but there is government
 ownership in certain key sectors, particularly mining and
 transportation. Austerity measures aimed at reforming Sierra
 Leone's economy and meeting conditions for continued access to
 International Monetary Fund loans were initiated in July
 1986. As a result, the majority of the population has
 experienced some hardship, but there has been relatively
 little overt public discontent.
 There were no reports of major human rights abuses in Sierra
 Leone during 1986. Significantly less campaign violence
 occurred in the 1986 elections than in the previous national
 elections. Irregularities were reported in 17 constituencies,
 but these were redressed by repolling within a few weeks of
 the original election date.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of abduction of individuals by the
 Government or hostage taking by nongovernmental groups.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no specific reports of torture. Harsh physical
 treatment of prisoners by police, however, is probably
 common. Attorneys occasionally have reported being shown
 bruises and other marks of violence on detainees' bodies that
 
 
 262
 SIERRA LEONE
 they believe could have been caused by police beatings.
 According to Amnesty International's 1986 Report, a student
 detained in March 1985 was beaten unconscious by SSD
 officers. He had been detained with at least 41 others in
 connection with a strike by the Sierra Leone Motor Driver's
 Union called to protest the detention and ill-treatment of
 some of its members.
 Prisons are dangerously overcrowded, and the local press has
 deplored prison conditions. Prison deaths due to
 malnutrition, pneumonia, diarrhea, and gastroenteritis are
 said to be common.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Sierra Leonean law, detained persons have the right to a
 judicial determination of the legality of their detention. It
 is widely charged, however, particularly in Sierra Leonean
 legal circles, that police, as a form of harassment, sometimes
 detain persons for short periods without charge. Under normal
 circumstances detainees not charged with an offense within 28
 days of arrest must by law be released, unless a state of
 emergency is in effect.   During a state of emergency,
 however, the Public Emergency Act comes into effect, and
 persons detained under its provisions are not guaranteed a
 hearing unless charged with a capital offense. At the end of
 1986, no one was being detained under public emergency
 regulations. Under the Constitution, the President has the
 right to order the detention of any person who is, or is
 reasonably suspected to be, dangerous to the well-being of the
 Republic.
 Neither exile nor forced labor is practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary has generally maintained its independence,
 although some critics charge that the legal system is subject
 to political manipulation, often before cases reach the
 courts. Sierra Leone's courts have a reputation for providing
 fair public trials. Defendants are allowed counsel of their
 choice, and convictions may be appealed. Many defendants,
 however, cannot afford counsel, and public defenders are
 provided only in capital offense cases.
 The legal system is heavily overburdened and lacking in
 resources. This results in an average delay of 2 years before
 cases actually come to trial. The only official records of
 proceedings are handwritten notes taken by the judges. This
 practice limits lawyers' access to written documentation and
 puts in question the impartiality of the official record.
 At the end of the year, no political prisoners were reported
 as being held. However, some of the persons convicted for
 involvement in the outbreak of violence in the Pujehun
 District in 1983 are still in prison, and allegations exist
 that political motivations were partially behind their initial
 detention.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 These rights of the individual are generally not abused by the
 State, and legal safeguards against arbitrary invasion of the
 home are usually observed. Neither censorship of mail nor
 electronic eavesdropping by the State on private conversations
 
 
 263
 SIERRA LEONE
 have been reported. Some organizations have claimed that
 informers report to the Government on their activities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although freedom of speech is legally guaranteed, this freedom
 can be abridged under the Constitution if the proper
 functioning of the Government is deemed to be in jeopardy. In
 practice, the Government generally tolerates public criticism
 by individual citizens, and academic freedom is fully
 respected. Political propaganda occasionally circulates
 within the country from opposition groups based in Western
 Europe or the United States.
 There is, in practice, considerable freedom of the press and
 no prior government censorship of the press. The 10 privately
 owned newspapers report on sensitive political and economic
 topics, and investigative reporting on misuse of government
 funds, bribery, and bureaucratic indiscipline has been
 published. The Government, in the person of the President or
 Minister of Information, regularly issues press releases
 stating that there is no press censorship but usually adds
 that critics should be fair and place events in the context of
 the development process. The Government thus expects
 journalists to exercise some self-censorship. Most editors
 avoid publishing articles portraying the country in a critical
 light or attacking the President personally. This approach is
 codified in the Newspaper Act of 1983, which specifies
 qualification standards for editors and sets a fee for
 registration of newspapers. In 1985 two journalists were
 imprisoned for contempt, and the editor of an independent
 newspaper, For Di People, was imprisoned for over 70 days
 without charge or trial after publishing an article on the
 excesses of the Special Security Division. There were no
 arrests or detention of members of the press in 1986.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees the right of freedom of assembly
 and permits the formation of and membership in trade unions or
 other economic, social, or professional associations. These
 rights are, however, limited, most significantly where
 assembly or association would conflict with the "proper
 functioning of the party" or with public order. This was the
 rationale employed when a group of persons was detained after
 taking part in peaceful demonstrations in April. The
 detainees were acquitted shortly after their arrest because
 the Government failed to prove that the group's actions
 constituted a serious threat to public order. In practice,
 freedom of association in the nonpolitical sphere is respected.
 Trade unions normally are permitted to operate freely and
 exercise the rights to organize, negotiate, strike against
 employers, join in confederations, and affiliate with
 international organizations. When trade unions publicly
 challenged government policy in 1981, the Government arrested
 approximately 180 union members. The Sierra Leone Labor
 Congress elected an executive committee in 1982, but this
 group's political independence may have been compromised in
 April 1986 when its head was appointed a member of
 Parliament. Most sectors of the Sierra Leone economy, except
 agriculture, are unionized. The Labor Congress is a member of
 
 
 264
 SIERRA LEONE
 the International Confeder'ation of Free Trade Unions. Private
 associations of citizens can and do make representations to
 the Government on policy issues and are not subject to
 reprisals.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is a tradition of religious tolerance in Sierra Leone.
 There is no state or otherwise favored religion. Muslims (the
 most numerous religious group), Christians, animists, and
 adherents of other faiths practice their religions freely and
 publish religious documents without government interference.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation.
 The only official control on travel within the country is in
 diamond mining areas where restrictions are intended to
 control smuggling. There are few regulations restricting
 foreign travel. Sierra Leone, a party to the UN Convention
 and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, is host to
 approximately 290 refugees, most of whom are students from
 Namibia. There have been no reported incidents of forced
 repatriation.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Former President Stevens was the dominant authority in Sierra
 Leone until 1985, when he retired and arranged for his
 succession by Major General Momoh. The Parliament, at
 Stevens' behest, amended the Constitution to allow Momoh to
 become President without resigning his military commission,
 and in August of that year the single party, the All Peoples'
 Congress, under the control of Stevens, nominated Momoh as
 President. Since independence in 1961, the clear trend in
 political development has been to increase executive power and
 decrease constitutional checks on that power. The
 Constitution provides that the leader of the party will be the
 sole candidate for the office of President. A Cabinet,
 selected by the President from elected as well as appointed
 members of Parliament, meets with the President regularly and
 is a key advisory body.
 The unicameral Parliament is subservient to the executive
 branch of the Government. However, some observers suggest
 that President Momoh has encouraged a so-called "backbenchers"
 association in Parliament to become an internal voice of
 opposition. Candidates for Parliament are chosen in each
 constituency by the party's local executive committee. The
 executive committee chooses up to five candidates from the
 list of citizens who seek nomination. The central committee
 of the party, among whose members are both President Momoh and
 ex-President Stevens, can disapprove the nomination of any
 locally selected nominee whose candidacy it believes would be
 inimical to the State. The 1986 parliamentary elections
 generally followed these guidelines, and all but 6 of the 105
 constituencies had contested elections. All winning
 candidates, by the nature of the system, were APC members.
 The two vice presidents were among the six members of
 Parliament elected without opposition, but several prominent
 candidates, including former cabinet ministers, were among
 those defeated.
 
 
 SIERRA LEONE
 In addition to the national political system, a traditional
 system of local government operates in the provinces.
 Paramount chiefs are elected for life by the members of local
 chiefdom councils. The paramount chiefs retain considerable
 authority in local affairs and in resolving minor disputes
 among their traditional subjects.
 There is universal suffrage, and no groups are precluded from
 voting because of gender, tribe, race or religion.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 In 1985 members of the Sierra Leone Bar Association organized
 the Society for the Preservation of Human Rights, and in June
 1986 its constitution was ratified. The Government has not
 interfered with the organization, which is supported by
 members of Parliament, judges, medical doctors, academics,
 civil servants, trade unionists and the media. The Society
 won its first major court case in early 1986. Local chapters
 of Amnesty International also exist.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no officially sanctioned discrimination on the basis
 of race, sex, religion, language, or social status. Members
 of Sierra Leone's various ethnic and religious groups interact
 peacefully and are represented in all levels of the
 Government. Women are guaranteed equal rights by the
 Constitution, but their status varies substantially in
 different parts of the country and depends upon the cultural
 values of various tribal groups. Women have, in some regions
 of Sierra Leone, been elected to the prestigious position of
 paramount chief. The Government continues to be male
 dominated, but women are prominent in some professions, and
 one woman is a Supreme Court Justice. In the 1986
 parliamentary elections, only 5 of the 112 members elected
 were women.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The normal work week is 38 1/2 hours (7 hours on each of the 5
 weekdays and 3 1/2 hours on Saturdays). An established code
 sets out acceptable standards for the workplace, covering
 maintenance of machinery, safety procedures, and sanitary
 conditions. In actual practice, however, manufacturing
 concerns in Sierra Leone, of which there are very few,
 probably do not conform to the code, and there is no
 practicable means of enforcing it. There is no minimum age
 for the employment of children. Sierra Leone has no
 legislated minimum wage, and outside the public sector there
 are no comprehensive wage or salary guidelines. Because of
 the recent float of the leone, the government currently is
 reviewing existing public sector wage and salary scales. In
 conjunction with this review, the Sierra Leone Labor Congress
 has a petition before the Parliament to create a national
 minimum wage scale.
