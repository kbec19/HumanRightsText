 OATAR-
 .A small. Arab Gulf state ruled by an Amir from the Al-Thani
 family, Qatar is governed by a 1970 basic law which
 institutionalizes the customs and social mores of Qatar's
 conservative Wahhabi Muslim heritage. These include respect
 for the sanctity,of private property, freedom from arbitrary
 arrest and imprisonment, and protection against transgressions
 ofrIslamic-law (the Shari'a). The Amir holds absolute power,
 but he is careful in exorcising his authority. While he may,
 for example,, suspend any secular law or countermand any civil
 court decisio, he is unlikely to do so without first
 cnnsulting.his Council of Ministers, the advisory council of
 notables, and most importantly, obtaining a consensus from
 within the ruling Al-Thani-family..                "
 The Government continues to be concerned by the presence in
 Qatar of-a'large number of expatriate workers. In response to
 perceived threats to civil order, the Government has
 established an efficient sedurity apparatus to control
 subversion. The civilian security apparatus is controlled by
 the.Interior Ministry and operates on two levels, the police
 and-the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). The CID is
 charged with investigation of all crimes, while the local
 police enforce laws and arrest violators. A second, more
 powerful braoch of the Interior Mtnistry, the Mubahathat,
 deals with sedition and espionage. The Mubahathat is nearly
 independent of the regular civil security forces-and has been
 alleged to use severe force during its investigations. It can
 incarcerate suspects withoub charge, but reportedly, does this
 infrequently. The armed forces have no significant role in
 asaurjngjinternal secarity, although the army could be used-
 against -serious civil disturbances. However,.the armed forces
 have under their jurisdication another enforcement
 organization, known as-4ukhabarat, whose function is'to
 intercept and arrest incoming terrorists and to keep
 survekllance-over political dissidents.         "
 Qatars;conomy is mixed, with the State owning and operating
 most baio-.industries and services-while retail trade and the
 construction industry remain in private hands. The economy is
 beginniig.to recover slowly from.the fall in the price of oil,
 and was. able to expand slightly again in 1989;' The rapid
 developmelt-of Qatar's infrastructure in the 19J0's and early
 1980's led to the creation.of-a ratio of expatriates (mostly.
 Indian, Pakistani, and Sri Lankan) to nationals of 4 to 1.
 Limiting the influence and controlling the activities of the
 expa-riate pop.lation-areanajor Qatari national goals, and the
 economi._4ownturn of-the mid--to-late 80's has spurred a  -:
 goveriQment, program to reduce the exgiatriate-to-national ratio
 by offering employment an many government industries to Qatari
 citizens- only. -gowever, this refers- only to skilled workers.
 Because the Qatari.national population is so small, Qatar will
 be dependent on expatriate labor for the foreseeable future.
 There wjreno reports of arbitrary arrest or similar abuses in
 1989, but -human. Tights remained significantly restricted, with
 little change from-previous years. Principa human rights
 problems include abuse of detainees, arbitrary detentions in
 security cases, and restrictions on freedom of speech and
 press, assembly and association, the right of citizens to
 change their government, and worker rights. Expatriate
 workers also continued to complain of systematic
 discrimination against them; Qatari resentment against
 expatriates makes them more likely than nationals to be the
 victims of arbitrary police action or harassment, and they are
 
 
 1543
 denied the right to bring suit against a Qatari national in
 the Shari'a court.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known instances of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Government of Qatar follows the conservative teachings of
 Wahhabi Islam, which forbids torture. Instances of torture in
 connection with security force actions involving political and
 security-related cases, however, have been reported in the
 past, although details are sketchy. The Government
 administers most of the corporal punishments prescribed by
 Shari'a law but does not allow physical mutilation. Many
 expatriates complain of mistreatment after their arrest by
 Qatari authorities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The authorities generally charge suspects before a competent
 court within 48 hours. In most cases involving expatriates,
 the police promptly notify the appropriate consular
 representative. However, suspects detained in security cases
 are generally not afforded their rights. There were no known
 security cases in 1989. Involuntary exile is very rare; the
 last known case occurred over 10 years ago. Expatriates
 convicted of crimes are usually deported after they have
 completed their sentences, which sometimes includes the
 administering of lashes. With regard to forced or compulsory
 labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is nominally independent, but most judges are
 expatriates holding residence permits granted by the civil
 authorities and thus hold their positions at the Government's
 pleasure.
 Qatar's legal system has an unusual balance, tilted- in favor
 of Qataris and the Government of Qatar. There are two types
 of courts: the civil courts, which have jurisdiction in civil
 and commercial matters, and the Shari'a court, which has
 jurisdiction in family and criminal cases. There are no
 permanent security courts; security cases are tried by
 military courts established specifically for.a given case.
 Technically, the Shari'a court may also assume jurisdiction in
 commercial or civil cases if requested to do so by one of the.
 litigants. In practice, the Sharila court only assumes
 discretionary jurisdiction if a Muslim litigant makes the
 request. It does not allow non-Muslims to bring a suit as
 plaintiffs. This anomaly prevents non-Muslim residents from
 obtaining full legal recourse when being sued by or trying to
 sue a Qatari national. There are no statutes preventing
 
 
 1544
 QATh
 individuals from suing the Government of Qatar, but the threat
 or fear of losing a residence permit discourages such suits.
 There have been'at least three cases in which a person was
 injured as a result of medical malpractice at the
 government-owned hospital, but no suits were filed.
 Many expatriates find proceedings in the Sharila court
 bewildering. Only the disputing parties, their relatives and
 associates, and witnesses are allowed in the courtroom.
 Lawyers may not play any formal role, except to prepare
 litigants for their cases. Although non-Arabic speakers are
 provided with translators, foreigners report being at a
 considerable disadvantage, especially in cases involving the
 nonperformance of contracts. Sharila trials are normally
 briel. After both parties have stated their cases and
 examined witnesses, the judge is likely to deliver a verdict
 with only a short delay. Criminal cases are normally tried 2
 to 3 months after suspects are detained.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Traditional attitudes of respect for the sanctity of the home
 provide a great deal of protection against arbitrary
 intrusions for most citizens. The police must normally obtain
 a warrant before searching a residence or business, except in
 cases involving national security or emergencies. There were
 no reports of illegal searches of homes in 1989. The police
 and security forces routinely monitor the communications of
 suspected criminals aild sequrity risks. Mail-and periodicals
 thought to contain pornography, politically sensitive
 material, or criticism of Islam are also opened and routinely
 censored.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although both-expatriates and-Qataris may express political
 opinions in private, public criticism of the ruling family and
 itsipolicies is not tolerated. The Government strongly
 discourages attacks on other Arab governments as well. This
 applies to the electronic media, which are government owned
 and operated, as well as to the press. Journalists,
 particularly the expatriates, generally avoid challenging
 these-restpictions because of the risk of having residence
 permits cancelled.:
 The authorities routinely screen all video cassettes, audio
 tapes, books, and periodicals for objectionable political
 sentiments.and pornography.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government allows private social, sports, trade,
 professional, and cultural societies to operate. The
 activities of these organizations, which must register with
 the Government, are closely watched. The Government does not
 allow political demonstrations, nor are political parties
 allowed. For a discussion of freedom of association as it
 applies to labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 
 
 1545
 c." Freedom of Religion
 Qatar's state religion is Islam, the Koran is its basic
 constitution, and Shari'a law is its legal code. Members of
 other religions are prohibited from public worship, and they
 may not proselytize. Apostasy from Islam is a capital
 offense, although no one is known to have been executed for
 it. The Government tolerates non-Muslim religions, and
 non-Muslim parents may raise their children in their own
 faiths.. Private gatherings of non-Muslims for religious
 purposes are tacitly allowed but are closely monitored for
 potential political implications.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on internal travel, except around
 sensitive Qatari military and oil installations; In general,
 women, both Qataris and foreigners, do not require permission
 from a male guardian to travel either within the country or
 abroad. However, Qatari men can prevent their female
 relatives from leaving the country by placing their names with
 immigration officers at the ports of departure. Technically,
 Qatari women employed by the Government must obtain official
 permission to travel abroad when requesting leave; it is not
 known to what extent this regulation is enforced. Similarly,
 expatriate women sponsored directly by an employer (rather
 than their husbands) must obtain permission to leave the
 country. All Qatari citizens have the right to return.
 Foreigners are subject to immigration restrictions designed to
 control the size of the local labor pool. Foreigners who work
 in Qatar must have a sponsor to enter Qatar and the sponsor's
 permission to leave.
 The Government has no formal policy on refugees. Those
 attempting to enter illegally, including defectors from nearby
 countries, are refused entry. Refugees who can obtain local
 sponsorship or employment will-be allowed to enter. However,
 if they lose their jobs, they are expected to leave or face
 deportation. .The Government continues to enforce its policy
 of discouraging Qatari males from martying foreigners by
 refusing to issue residency permits to foreign wives. In such
 cases, the wife must reside in another country, where she is
 visited by her Qatari husband.        -
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Qatar has no formal democratic institutions, and citizens do
 not, therefore, have the right or ability peacefully to change
 their government or the political system. Qatar's political
 institutions blend the characteristics of a traditiohal
 Bedouin tribal state and a modern bureaucracy. There are no
 political parties, elections, or organized opposition to the
 Government. The Amir exercises all executive and legislative
 powers. His rule, however, is tempered somewhat by local
 custom. Interlocking family'networks and the recognized right
 of citizens to submit appeals or petitions personally to the
 Amir provide informal avenues for redress of many grievances
 and also serve to limit abuses. The custom of rule by
 consensus leads to extensive consultations among the Amir,
 leading merchant families,- religious leaders, and other
 notables on important policies.
 
 
 1546
 Under Qatar's Basic Law of 1970, the Amir must be chosen from
 and by the adult males of the Al-Thani family. The current
 Amir, Khalifa bin Hamad, has designated his son, Hamad bin
 Khalifa, as the heir apparent. This designation was made with
 the consent of the notables and religious leaders in
 accordance with local custom. Effective power remains in the
 hand, of the Anir, his family, and local notables.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No international or nongovernmental organization monitoring
 human rights abuses has asked to investigate conditions in
 Qata-r. No local organizations 'that concern themselves with
 human rights are permitted to exist.
 Section 5 Discriminatio. Based-or-.Race, Sex, Religion,
 -  Language, or Social Status
 The Government discriminates against expatriates and persons
 of non-Qatari origin even though they may be citizens of
 Qatar. In the past, Qatar naturalized a number of persons of
 Iranian origin. After the fall of the Shah and the rise of
 Shi'ite fundamentalism in Iran, the Government began to
 withdraw Qatari citizenship from many such persons. There
 have been reports of Qataris of Iranian descent being
 expatriated, fired from their government jobs, and deported-
 without the benefit of due process.
 Violence against yomen, primarily expatriate domestic workers,
 occurs in Qatar but is not believed to-be a common problem.
 In keeping with Islamic law, all forms of physical abuse are
 illegal, and the maximum penalty for rape is the death
 sentence. The police actively investigate all reports of"'
 violence against women.. Few cases come to the attention of
 the authorities, however, since most victims do not press
 charges for fear of being repatriated. The law is applied
 unevenly, with Qataris-partiqiiarly members of the ruling
 family--facing less severe punishments than do expatriates
 charged with rape or physical abuse.
 The activities of Qatari women are governed by strict. Wahhabi
 customs and quasi-legal restrictions,�such as a prohibition
 against the issuance of driver's licenses to women unless they
 11ave permission from a male guardian and can demonstrate a
 need to drive based on employment or other acceptable
 reasons. However, these restrictions generally do not apply
 to non-Qatari women. Qatari women are largely relegated to
 the roles of mother and homemaker, but some women are now
 finding jobs in education, medicine, and the news media, and
 more Qatari women are receiving government scholarships to
 pursue degrees in these fields at universities overseas.
 it. is common practice to discriminate against the employment
 of non-Muslims, particularly in sensitive areas such as
 security and education. There also are reports that those who
 hold to fundamentalist tenets have an advantage in employment.
 and hiring practices.

 QATAR
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right of association is strictly limited, and workers are
 prohibited from forming labor unions. Persons are allowed to
 establish organizations based on their professional or private
 interests. Membership in international professional
 organizations critical of the Government of Qatar or any other
 Arab government is not permitted. The Government would
 severely restrict operations of any organized group which it
 deemed detrimental to the national interest.
 Workers have the right to strike after their case has been
 presented to the Labor Conciliation Board and a decision has
 been made. Strikes are rare. There were at least two
 organized work stoppages over unpaid wages in 1988, but none
 were reported in 1989.
 Qatar has been a member of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) since 1972, but has ratified neither ILO
 Convention 87 on Freedom of Association nor Convention 98 on
 the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining. The
 government-designated worker delegate to the 1989 ILO
 Conference was listed as being the head of the workerst
 committee of the Qatar General Petroleum Corporation.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers in Qatar are prohibited from engaging in collective
 bargaining. All disputes between workers and employers are
 handled in the local labor courts. There are no export
 processing zones in Qatar.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There have been no reported instances of forced or compulsory
 labor, which are prohibited by law.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum working age is 18 years, but expatriate children
 sometimes work at younger ages in small family-owned
 businesses and shops. Although the laws governing the minimum
 age for employment of children are not strictly enforced,
 child labor, either Qatari or expatriate, is rare in Qatar.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Qatar has enacted regulations concerning worker safety and
 health, but enforcement is lax, at best. There is no minimum
 wage in Qatar. The 48-hour workweek is prescribed by law.
 Employess who work more than 48 hours a week (or 36 hours a
 week during the Muslim month of Ramadan) are entitled to
 overtime. The law is enforced in government offices and major
 private sector companies, but not in regard to domestic or
 personal employees. However, the workweek is usually less
 than 48 hours. Domestic servants frequently work 7 days a
 week, 12 hours a day, with few or no holidays, and have no way
 to redress grievances against their employer.
 Expatriate workers in Qatar must be sponsored by a recognized
 organization or person legally responsible for them during
 their residence in Qatar. Technically, any worker can seek
 legal relief. Unskilled workers, including domestic servants,
 
 
 1548
 who constitute the group most likely to experience onerous
 working conditions, generally accept their situation rather
 than risk repatriation.
