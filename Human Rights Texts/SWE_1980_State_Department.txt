 SWEDEN
 Fundamental political freedoms and human rights of Swedish
 citizens are guaranteed by the constitution. Sweden
 occupies a prominent position in international efforts to
 enhance human rights. In the United Nations, it has been
 active in support of initiatives against torture,
 campaigned for measures to ensure religious tolerance and
 proposed the outlawing of capital punishment. Sweden has
 ratified the two international human rights covenants and
 the optional protocol to the Covenant on Civil and
 Political Rights and is a party to the European Convention
 on Human Rights.
 The comprehensive system of human rights which exists in
 Sweden exists by government design. The government and a
 cross section of Swedes from right to left consider the
 protection of human rights a cornerstone of Swedish
 society. Swedish ombudsmen, appointed by Parliament and
 with full autonomy, are charged with the investigation of
 complaints of private persons that their rights have been
 violated.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice (Chapter 2, Article 3 of the "Instrument of
 Government*).
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and reipected in
 practice. Sweden has a progressive prison system.
 Periodic home visits for prisoners are a special feature
 of the system.
 c. Disappearances
 Abduction, secret arrests, and clandestine detention are
 unknown in Sweden.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Guarantees with respect to the integrity of the person are
 heeded scrupulously. However, habeas corpus does not
 exist. Preventive detention is of fixed term. Suspects
 can be held for interrogation for six hours, which can be
 extended in serious cases for a second six hours.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Swedish constitution forbids deprivation of liberty
 without public trial by a court of law. Every citizen has
 the right to effective counsel. The judiciary functions
 freely and independently of the executive. There are no
 military courts in Sweden in peacetime.

 f. Invasion of the Rome
 Freedom from arbitrary invasion of the home is guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice. Searches are limited
 under law to cases in which the suspect is believed to
 have committed a crime punishable by at least two years'
 imprisonment. Wiretapping is limited to cases involving
 narcotics or national security. With certain exceptions,
 searches and wiretaps require court approval.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Sweden has been a world leader since the 1930s in policies
 to meet basic needs such as food, shelter, health care and
 education. Social welfare legislation provides for health
 and medical services, welfare services, various family
 benefits, pensions, and disability and unemployment
 insurance. Per capita gross domestic product in Sweden
 was $12,240 in 1979, and the government attempts to
 redistribute the wealth evenly among all segments of the
 population. Unemployment remains about two percent. A
 conscious effort continues to extend equality between the
 sexes to the fullest. There is a government ombudsman for
 equal employment opportunity, legal protection of the
 right to equal pay for equal work, and a conscious effort
 to break down patterns which associate men and women
 exclusively with specific jobs.
 Around 425,000 foreign nationals live in Sweden as legal
 immigrants, of whom around 225,000 are employed. They
 enjoy welfare benefits and legal protection essentially
 equal to those enjoyed by Swedish citizens, including the
 right to vote in local elections. The Swedish government
 has established special programs designed to help the
 immigrant workers adjust to Swedish life and culture, and
 has cooperated with the press to generate publicity aimed
 at gaining greater acceptance of immigrant workers among
 the Swedish public at large. Allegations of
 discrimination against immigrants have occurred during
 1980. These charges have centered on such matters as
 denial of housing or of accommodations in restaurants and
 hotels, rather than on employment or fundamental economic
 and political rights. There are effective legal
 procedures to look into complaints of discrimination.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Swedes enjoy the full exercise of these freedoms. There
 is a national church supported by public funds, but this
 in no way restricts religious freedom.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement within and from the country,
 as well as a right of voluntary repatriation. Sweden
 maintains quotas for admission of refugees, a status which
 entails numerous benefits, but political asylum is granted
 without respect to quotas.
 
 
 882
 
 There has been a small net immigration in recent years,
 principally Finnish. Refugees and asylees have come
 largely from Latin America in recent years, but also from
 Eastern Europe, Vietnam, and other countries. Of some
 1,250 refugees to be accepted between July 1980 and June
 1981, most are expected to come from Latin America. A
 special additional quota of 750 has been established for
 Vietnamese refugees.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Sweden has a long history of orderly democratic political
 life. There is universal suffrage over age 18, and, while
 voting is not compulsory, participation in national
 elections is usually around 90 percent of the eligible
 electorate. All aliens who have been registered residents
 of Sweden for at least three years have the right to vote
 and to run for office in municipal and county council
 elections. Labor is free to organize, and workers have
 the right to strike. The large majority of the Swedish
 working population belongs to a trade union. This
 includes career military personnel and civilian government
 officals. Although the country's largest trade union
 association and largest political party are closely
 associated, the activities of that union and of others are
 directed by the unions themselves. Women enjoy legal
 equality in Sweden. They participate fully in the
 economic, political and social life of Sweden.
 4. GoverRnment Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 No question of an independent, outside investigation of
 alleged human rights violations in Sweden has been posed.
 With regard to pertinent third countries, Sweden supports
 the principle of independent outside investigations.
 Swedish government agencies are in close contact with
 Amnesty International, the International Committee of the
 Red Cross, church organizations, and a variety of other
 private and public groups working in Sweden and abroad for
 the defense of human rights. Sweden plays a leading role
 in international human rights bodies.
