 PORTUGAL
 During the 48-year (1926-74) dictatorship of Antonio Salazar
 and Marcelo Caetano, human rights were severely infringed.
 The so-called "New State" of Dr. Salazar was a corporate
 structure allegedly representative of socio-economic
 interest groups rather than political parties. The tenets
 of the regime were authoritarian government, patriotic
 unity, Christian morality and the work ethic. The regime
 was a paternalistic one in which real opposition was not
 tolerated. Membership in the rubber-stamp national assembly
 was limited to members of the only legal political
 organization, the pro-regime "National Union". Sham
 elections were the rule. Officially sanctioned "workers'
 syndicates" replaced free trade unions. Censorship was
 rigid. Salazar developed a secret police corps (PIDE) that
 rooted out opposition to the regime through a network of
 paid informers. The PIDE violated human-rights frequently,
 and, in the process, alienated much of the population. The
 regime did, however, always retain substantial public
 support.
 When Caetano came to power in 1968 many people looked for a
 mitigation of the regime's rougher edges. Caetano, a
 respected professor, was considered a moderate within the
 regime, and he had often taken unpopular stands in
 opposition to Salazar. Caetano spoke of "evolution within
 continuity" and sought to institute change fast enough to
 keep up with expectations but not so fast, as to antagonize
 conservatives. He eased police repression and presided over
 the freest el~ctions in decades in 1969. He changed the
 name of the new state to the "Social State," but, at base,
 it remained an authoritarian regime.
 The Revolution of April 25, 1974 opened the way for dramatic
 improvement in human rights. Overnight, censorship was
 abolished, PIDE was dismantled, and free speech was
 exercised. Exiled opposition leaders returned, and
 political parties were formed. A number of former PIDE
 officials and agents were imprisoned for lengthy periods
 while the revolutionary government determined whether
 grounds existed to try them for crimes committed in their
 official capacities, but most were eventually released. In
 the near anarchy and anti-conservative excessess of 1974-75,
 there were isolated incidents of human-rights violations by
 some officials and agencies. This was particularly true
 during the leftist crackdown following the unsuccessful
 rightist coup attempt on March 11, 1975. However, after the
 unsuccessful leftist coup attempt on November 25, 1975,
 political turmoil abated and the country went about the task
 of revising the constitution and preparing for democratic
 elections. Respect for human rights became one of the
 cornerstones of the new post-November 25 Portugal. The
 trend in Portuguese human rights policies has been, with a
 few minor lapses, steady, positive and commendable since
 1975.
 A Constituent Assembly approved and decreed a new
 constitution on April 2, 1976, which includes 25 articles
 spelling out "rights, freedoms and safeguards" guaranteed
 Portuguese citizens and residents. Portugal adhered to the
 U. N. Universal Declaration on Human Rights during the 1977-
 78 National Assembly session; ratified the European
 Convention on Human Rights with reservations on November 12,
 1978; signed October 7, 1976 and ratified July 31, 1978 the
 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
 Rights; and signed October 7, 1976 and ratified June 15,
 1978 the International Covenant on Civil and Political
 Rights. Portugal was elected a member of the United Nations
 Human Rights Commission in May 1978.

 Private organizations with an interest in human rights have
 maintained a high level of activity in the last year. The
 Portuguese branch of the International League for Human
 Rights has embarked on a significant program of human rights
 activities, and a prominent Portuguese lawyer is active on
 the League's international board. Portuguese media have
 featured stories on human rights violations around the
 world.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Portugal has been free from torture since the dismantling of
 the secret police in 1974. Torture is forbidden under the
 constitution. Former PIDE Inspector Adelino da Silva Tinoco
 was tried and convicted in 1978 on charges of torture and
 maltreatment of prisoners and is currently serving his
 sentence.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There have been no documented cases of cruel, inhuman or
 degrading treatment or punishment since November 1975. Such
 treatment or punishment is prohibited by the constitution.
 The death penalty was abolished over a century ago for
 civilian crimes. Certain crimes committed during war were
 punishable by death under the military penal code established
 in 1925. The death penalty in the military penal code was
 abolished in 1977 and replaced by a maximum penalty of 28
 years imprisonment-in a civilian penitentiary.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Since November 1975 there have been only a few cases in
 which Portuguese citizens were held without specific charges
 longer than the 48-hour period allowed by the constitution.
 In those cases, defense lawyers were able to obtain due
 process for their clients through legal efforts and
 publicity. There are civilian prisoners who have either
 been convicted or detained on criminal charges because of
 politically motivated acts of violence. The right to habeas
 corpus is guaranteed by the constitution.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Portugal allows no secret trials or condemnations, and the
 judicial system is fair, if at times slow. In three
 instances delays in bringing to trial persons charged with
 politically motivated crimes have raised human rights
 questions. Antonia Ramalho, a rightist charged with armed
 conspiracy, remained in jail for over a year without bail
 prior to- trial. She was subsequently tried and acquitted in
 August 1979. Isabel do Carmo and Carlos Antunes, members of
 a leftist revolutionary organization who allegedly committed
 bank holdups, have been in prison over one year awaiting
 trial. Seven former PIDE agents charged in October 1977 for
 the 1965 assassination of Portuguese General Delgado are now
 on trial. Local jurists predict the proceedings will be
 long and complicated. Three of the accused had been
 detained for as long as four years without trial.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 The inviolability of the home and the privacy of
 correspondence and other means of private communications are
 guaranteed. The constitution requires an "order of the
 
 
 648
 competent judicial authority" for searches of and entries
 into homes, and specifies that the consent of the occupants
 must be obtained to enter a home at night.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education:
 Portugal is one of the poorest countries in non-Communist
 Europe and, proportionately, has one of the largest rural
 populations in Europe. The economy is beset by serious
 problems. Property is generally privately owned, although
 agricultural collectives and cooperatives exist in the
 southern part of the country.
 Since 1975 Portugal has sought to alleviate the hardship of
 the least advantaged, despite severe financial limitations.
 The government has continued its programs for contruction of
 housing units throughout Portugal for low-income families,
 including refugees from former Portuguese colonies in
 Africa. In order to improve health conditions among rural
 and low-income populations, the government has pursued
 programs to construct water, sewage and sanitation
 facilities throughout the country. Many of these projects
 are targeted on the poorest sections of the country.
 Although general economic difficulties impede progress in
 these areas, there have been significant accomplishments. A
 national health care scheme was passed by the Legislative
 Assembly in 1979.
 Education is free through secondary school. Portugal has
 embarked upon a large scale school construction program to
 combat its estimated 35 percent illiteracy rate and lack of
 educational opportunity in rural areas. In 1979 the
 government devoted a substantial portion of its budget to
 education, and the Legislative Assembly passed a law calling
 for a concentrated drive to wipe out illiteracy.
 The Social Security program is included in the country's
 general budget. Minimum wage laws are in effect. To
 alleviate the hardships of the present 25 percent inflation
 rate, the government has sought to maintain the purchasing
 power of the poor through a program of subsidies, although
 it has lowered some subsidies of essential goods.
 Portugal has made a massive government and private effort to
 absorb and assist more than 700,000 former residents of the
 African colonies to which it granted independence during
 1975. Although beset by an unemployment rate estimated at
 12 to 14 percent, Portugal devoted substantial portions of
 public funds to help feed, cloth, provide employment to, and
 reintegrate into society residents of its former colonies.
 In 1979 the government, in cooperation with international
 agencies, assisted refugees who voluntarily wished to return
 to the former colonies. Portuguese-Administered Macao has
 agreed to provide shelter for up to 5,000 Indochinese
 refugees at-any given time provided onward locations can be
 secured for them.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly:
 These freedoms are guaranteed under the constitution and
 respected in practice.
 The National Assembly passed the so-called "Anti-Facist Law"
 in June 1978, prohibiting fascist organizations, discussions
 of corporatism and other activities related to "fascism."
 
 
 649
 The law provides penalties of from two to eight years
 imprisonment for violations. Because of its vagueness and
 applicability to one side of the political spectrum, the law
 has been questioned by some Portuguese human rights
 advocates. There have been no prosecutions so far under the
 law, although Portuguese press reports in late November 1979
 indicated that the government is considering criminal
 prosecution of Christian Democratic Party candidate Manual
 Murias. Murias made statements defending Salazar in a
 televised political announcement on November 19, 1979.
 Portugal's penal code has a provision authorizing up to
 eight years imprisonment for those found guilty of
 "insulting" civil or military bodies, the President of the
 Republic or members of the Revolutionary Council or the
 legislative assembly. A number of journalists have been
 prosecuted under this statute. Manual Murias, who is also
 editor of the weekly A Rua, has been prosecuted under
 Portugal's slander anT-iel laws and has spent several
 weeks in prison on such charges.
 In August and November 1979 police seized all newsstand
 copies of political satire cartoon books by Augusto Cid, one
 of Portugals foremost cartoonist, which contained satirical
 pictures of Portuguese President Eanes.
 An amnesty law pardoning individuals involved in the coup
 attempts of March 11 and November 25, 1975 and allowing
 members of the Armed Forces ousted in those incidents to
 apply for reinstatement was promulgated on November 23,
 1979. The law reportedly does not affect the status of
 officers dismissed from the Armed Forces in the period
 immediately following the April 1974 revolution.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration:
 Freedom of movement, foreign travel and emigration are
 guaranteed by Article 44 of the constitution. Domestic
 travel is not circumscribed. However, currency exchange
 restrictions imposed because of balance of payments problems
 impose some practical constraints on foreign travel by
 Portuguese citizens.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process:
 The political system is a democratic multi-party system in
 which opposition parties operate freely with access to the
 media. Only "fascist" organizations are outlawed. The
 government has rigorously respected the constitutional
 provision for universal, secret and equal suffrage for all
 citizens over 18 years of age.
 The April 1978 revision of the civil code guarantees full
 legal equality for women in accord with the constitution.
 In August 1979 Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo was appointed
 Portugal's first woman prime minister. However, Portugal
 remains in many respects a traditionalist society, and there
 is some discrimination against women, especially in jobs and
 salaries.
 Workers have the constitutional right to set up trade unions
 and trade union associations. A law prohibiting the
 establishment of more than one national labor confederation
 (which gave a monopoly to the communist-dominated General
 Confederation of Portuguese Workers) was revoked in 1976,
 and a new Democratic National Trade Confederation (UGT) has
 been established as an alternative to the CGTP. The right
 to strike is protected by the constitution.

 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 Portugal's government has cooperated with independent
 outside investigation of human rights conditions. Amnesty
 International and the International League for Human Rights
 have both reported favorably on Portugal's human rights
 record.
