 SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE*
 The Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, composed
 of two small islands off the west coast of Africa, has been
 a one-party state since independence in 1975. For five centu-
 ries before independence Sao Tome and Principe were colonies
 of Portugal. No political activity is permitted outside
 the ruling party, the Movement for the Liberation of Sao
 Tome and Principe. The Government draws heavily on Marxism-
 Leninism for its political principles, and state control
 of the means of production is the general rule. Manuel
 Pinto da Costa, founder and leader of the party since
 1972, "was elected" unopposed as the first President of
 the Republic in 1975 by the Popular Assembly, constitu-
 tionally the supreme organ of the state and highest legisla-
 tive body. In 1980 he was re-elected unopposed for a second
 five-year term. President da Costa is the only major
 decision-maker in the country.
 The only significant opposition to the Government in
 recent years has consisted of Sao Tomean exiles in Portugal.
 A number of formerly prominant political figures, including
 ex-Prime Minister Miguel Trovoada, have been in exile for
 several years.
 Freedom of speech and press is effectively circumscribed,
 and public criticism of the Government is extremely rare.
 The small defense force of local troops is reinforced by
 troops from Angola and assisted by advisors from Cuba and
 various Eastern bloc countries.   Political conditions in
 the country were sufficiently stable in 1981 for the Govern-
 ment to release a number of persons arrested and imprisoned
 earlier as security threats. In the latter half of 1982,
 however, increased security anxieties by the Government
 reportedly again led to increased political arrests without
 trial.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 No reports have been received of political killings in recent
 years.
 b. Disappearance
 No reports of abductions or secret political arrests have
 been received in recent years.
 c. Torture
 No reports of incidents of torture have been received.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 No reports of these abuses have been received in the past
 year.
 There is no US Mission in Sao Tome. Although the US
 Ambassador resident in Libreville, Gabon is accredited to
 Sao Tome and Principe and visits there periodically, informa-
 tion on human rights conditions in the country is limited.

 e. Arbitrary Arrests and Imprisonment
 Amnesty International reports that at least four persons
 arrested and imprisoned in past years on political charges,
 allegedly without due process, were released in 1981.
 Amnesty International continues to investigate the cases of
 several other persons reportedly arrested and detained
 arbitrarily, but it is not clear whether any are still being
 held. An as yet unverified report indicates that increased
 security measures in the latter half of 1982 have included
 an increased number of political arrests without formal
 charges, with some of the arrestees being held indefinitely
 and others eventually released.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 An unknown number of persons demonstrating against food
 shortages were arrested in December 1981, but it is uncer-
 tain whether any are still being held. Amnesty International
 continues to investigate the cases of persons allegedly ar-
 rested and imprisoned in past years without fair trials. No
 trial was held in the case of former Prime Minister Trovoado,
 who was arrested in 1979 and allowed to go into exile in 1981.
 The Constitution does not address the right of public trial,
 although it is believed the right is usually observed in
 practice in non-security-related cases.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 No incidents of the violations of the sanctity of the
 home were reported in 1981. There were some incidents
 reported in past years, which were usually related to
 political detentions.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Sao Tomean media are entirely organs of the Government
 and are obliged to adhere to the Government's position on
 all issues. No public criticism of the Government, or
 expression of dissenting political views, is permitted.
 The few individuals who have dared to voice openly their
 discontent with declining economic conditions have been
 promptly arrested. In December 1981 demonstrators on the
 island of Principe protested shortages of essential goods on
 the island. Government forces intervened to suppress the
 demonstration, shot and wounded several demonstrators and
 arrested a number more.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Assembly and association are legal in Sao Tome only within
 the official party. All labor organizations are affiliated
 with the party and are prohibited from striking. They do
 not play an independent role in the economy or political
 process.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 This right is protected, according to the Sao Tomean
 Constitution. No information is available on whether unoffi-
 cial discrimination is practiced against members of either
 of the three principal religious communities: Roman Catholic,
 Evangelical Protestant, and Seventh Day Adventist.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There have been no reports of problems in this area in
 recent years, although the geographic isolation of the
 islands and requirement for exit visas constitute impedi-
 ments to emigration.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Government policy is formulated by the President in discussion
 with his key cabinet and security officials. Public expres-
 sion of dissenting political views is not permitted. Citi-
 zen participation in Sao Tome's political process is limited
 to the single political party. In theory, district-level
 popular assemblies are elected every two and a half years,
 and these local assemblies choose the National Assembly. In
 1975, at the transition to independence, 52 candidates vied
 for 18 seats in the National Assembly. In 1980, mass meet-
 ings were held at which district-level popular assemblies
 were elected which, in turn, chose the members of the National
 Assembly. These "elections" have had little, if any, influ-
 ence on government policies.
 Women enjoy constitutional guarantees of equality with men.
 Some women are active in public life, and several are
 ministers, but cultural factors tend to restrict the majority
 of women to a traditional role.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violation of
 Human Rights
 In its 1982 Report, Amnesty International expressed concern
 about detention without charge or trial and unfair trials of
 political prisoners in Sao Tome. The extent to which the
 Government has taken cognizance of the concerns of interna-
 tional human rights organizations is not known.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Since the 1800's the economy of Sao Tome and Principe
 has been based almost exclusively on plantation agriculture.
 At the time of independence, Portuguese-owned plantations
 occupied about 90 percent of the total land area. After
 independence, the Government adopted a Marxist-Leninist
 political orientation and assumed control over the major
 economic enterprises on the islands. In the case of the
 cacao plantations, this involved expropriating the former
 Portuguese owners. The weak world market in recent years
 for cacao (which accounts for 90 percent of the country's
 export revenues), a record low 1981 cacao crop, and the
 mismanagement of the nationalized estates have placed
 considerable pressure on the economy. The resulting shor-
 tage of foreign exchange has produced shortages of such
 basic imported consumer goods as soap and cigarettes. While
 most people have enough to eat, one of the country's major
 problems is its heavy dependence on imported food. Lack of
 investment capital, skilled manpower, and effective indivi-
 dual incentives are other major impediments to development.
 The overriding domestic concern of the Sao Tomean Government,
 after political security, is economic development, particular-
 ly in the agricultural sector. The Government is concentrat-
 ing considerable effort on expanding domestic food production
 and revitalizing its cacao, copra, and coffee plantations.

 In order to help the Sao Tomean Government meet its goal of
 increasing agricultural production, the US Agency for
 International Development began in 1977 a two-phase project
 to provide equipment and technical support for a crop
 production and diversification program. The second phase of
 the project will run until 1984 and involve $1.5 million for
 procurement and training. Despite these efforts, the
 country's real GDP dropped 11.5 percent between 1980 and
 1981, its overall balance of payments declined 13.5 percent,
 and its external borrowing increased some 16.7 percent. Per
 capita GDP in 1981 is estimated at about $300.
 Some 100,000 Sao Tomeans live in their country of 372 square
 miles (269 persons per square mile), and their numbers are
 growing by some 2 percent annually. Three-fifths of the
 labor force is engaged in agriculture, fisheries, and
 forestry. Unemployment is estimated at 50 percent of the
 work force. The Government has attempted to improve health
 facilities (for example, through a malaria eradication
 program and pre- and post-natal clinics) and has succeeded
 in obtaining assistance in this area from a variety of over-
 seas sources. The most recent figure (for 1981) on the
 infant mortality rate per 1000 live births is 49.7. Illiter-
 acy remains very high, perhaps 90-95 percent. The Govern-
 ment is placing a high priority on the improvement of basic
 education and development of technical skills. The quality
 of urban housing varies for the most part from fair to poor
 by developed country standards and tends to be lower in
 rural areas. Access to services such as piped water and
 residential electricity is limited nation-wide. Access to
 food, shelter, health care, and education does not appear to
 be denied to any group on the basis of race, religion, sex,
 or ethnic background.
