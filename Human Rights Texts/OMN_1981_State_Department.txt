 SULTANATE OF OMAN
 Until Sultan Qaboos seized power from his father in 1970,
 Oman for decades had been ruled by a leader who opposed
 economic and cultural development. Since 1970, the
 sultanate has provided its citizens with a freer and more
 prosperous life through programs financed by revenues from
 its modest oil production. These advances have taken
 place despite burdens imposed on the country's financial
 and human resources by the Dhofar insurgency of 1965-1976,
 which was supported by the People's Democratic Republic of
 Yemen (PDRY). The insurgency was crushed in 1976, but the
 continuing hostility of the PDRY and the recent general
 increase in tensions in the Persian Gulf/Indian Ocean
 region have caused high levels of defense expenditures.
 Oman is an absolute monarchy. It has no elected
 representative bodies; freedom of the press, assembly and
 speech are circumscribed. Nevertheless, the formation of
 an "advisory council for the state" in November 1981 may
 offer broadened participation in the Omani government.
 The council, whose members are drawn from the government,
 the business community and the outlying regions, is to
 focus on economic and social development.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.  Torture
 The Omani criminal code prohibits torture. This
 prohibition appears to be observed in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Corporal mutilation is not used as a punishment for crime,
 and the few executions in recent years have been of
 convicted murderers. The major penal facility is modern
 in design and construction.
 c. Disappearances
 There were no allegations or reports of disappearances in
 1981.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Omani law does not specifically include habeas corpus or
 its equivalent, but the criminal code imposes penalties
 for unjustified arrest and detention by the authorities.
 Citizens can petition the courts, the minister of justice
 or the sultan for remedies in cases of violations of their
 rights. Abuses of the police power of arrest have
 occurred. There are also instances of petty
 arbitrariness, usually by law enforcement officials in
 outlying districts who exceed their legal mandate.
 Although the government of Oman has neither publicly
 acknowledged nor denied the holding of political
 prisoners, there are unsubstantiated reports that some
 insurgents and their sympathizers from the period of the
 Dhofar War still may be under detention.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although Freedom House, in its 1981 report, maintains that
 the right to a fair trial is not guaranteed, both Islamic
 law and the Omani criminal code call for a hearing and a
 fair trial by experienced judges. Some eyewitness
 
 
 1069
 accounts have indicated that trials are fair, while others
 report procedural bias in favor of the prosecution. In
 general, the judiciary seems to operate fairly
 independently. There may be regional variations.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Warrants are not required for police searches of private
 premises. Such searches, and probably instances of
 bugging as well, appear to be infrequent and to involve
 cases where the government perceives a security threat, or
 when smuggling (especially of arms and narcotics) is
 suspected.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Oman, especially outside the capital area, remains a
 traditional society in which political communication
 occurs through family, ethnic, tribal, and regional ties.
 There are no elected representative bodies, and freedom of
 the press, assembly, and speech are circumscribed. On the
 other hand, there is little evidence that most Omanis are
 even aware of these limitations. Criticism of individual
 officials and agencies is tolerated, but is not accorded
 media exposure. Although the government does not practice
 prior censorship, editorials by the media, both private
 and government-owned, almost invariably reflect official
 views. Publications from abroad are routinely censored
 for both politically and sexually offensive material, and
 are occasionally banned. There are no restrictions on
 religious practices for the small non-Muslim population.
 Labor unions, on the other hand, do not exist, and strikes
 are forbidden. There is neither an academic community,
 nor any professional groups of note.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Omanis living abroad before 1970 have returned to Oman in
 large numbers without legal obstacles. Included in this
 group are several thousand ethnic Omani refugees from East
 Africa who have been successfully resettled. Omanis may
 also travel and emigrate freely to foreign countries.
 Many Omanis now work abroad, especially in the United Arab
 Emirates, from which they return on the weekends. There
 also is a large community of expatriates working in Oman,
 the majority of whom come from the subcontinent. The
 police periodically conduct sweeps to detain and then
 deport persons working illegally in Oman.
 With the exception of Dhofar province, there are no
 restrictions on travel by Omanis within the country. The
 government has undertaken an extensive program of road
 building, including highways linking northern Oman with
 Dhofar and the United Arab Emirates with the Musandam
 peninsula. Women are subjected to no special travel
 restrictions and are free to own and operate motor
 vehicles in Oman.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There are neither political parties nor elections in
 Oman. Sultan Qaboos has stated that, as the numbers of
 educated Omanis increase, so will popular participation in
 the public life of the nation. The formation of an
 advisory council for the state in November 1981 may offer
 broadened participation in the Omani government. The
 council, whose members are drawn from the government, the
 
 
 1070
 business community and the outlying regions, is to focus
 on economic and social development.
 The only known opposition group consists of remnants of
 the Dhofar insurgency. Citizens have access to government
 officials through personal appeal, which is sanctioned by
 Islamic and tribal practice. No problems of nationality,
 citizenship or statelessness appear to exist.
 3. Government Attitudes and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The government declined to receive a proposed Amnesty
 International mission in 1972, when the Dhofar insurgency
 was at its peak. Since then, there have been no known
 requests by international human rights organizations to
 visit Oman. There are no independent organizations based
 within the country that observe, report, or contest human
 rights violations.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Before 1970, the government actively discouraged all forms
 of modernization. Oman was one of the poorest countries
 in the world, with a rudimentary economy and virtually no
 infrastructure. The commencement of oil exports in 1967,
 the accession of Sultan Qaboos in 1970, and the oil price
 increases of 1974 and 1979 have enabled the country to
 make great advances in almost every index of development.
 The government has made a firm commitment to improving the
 quality of life for its citizens, and has devoted a large
 proportion of its oil revenues to infrastructure building,
 industrialization, and improvements in the traditional
 pursuits of agriculture and fishing. Between 1970 and
 1980 the number of hospital beds was increased from 12 to
 several thousand, the number of students from a few
 hundred to nearly 100,000, and the length of paved roads
 from approximately ten kilometers to over 2000. Life
 expectancy has increased by some five years to 48.3, and
 programs to eradicate endemic diseases are well underway.
 Boosted by the return of Omanis from overseas, and by
 immigrants attracted by job opportunities and improved
 health care, population growth has increased to 3.1
 percent a year. Nonetheless, a great deal remains to be
 done, and in much of the country development has barely
 begun. Many towns and most rural areas still lack
 reliable supplies of safe water or electricity. The adult
 literacy rate is still well below 50 percent, and only 57
 percent of children are in primary school. For cultural
 reasons the education of girls (37 percent in primary
 school) lags far behind that of boys (76 percent in
 primary school). While many social groups in the capital
 area are becoming increasingly westernized and
 cosmopolitan, outside this small area society is still
 highly traditional, tightly organized along family and
 tribal lines. Similarly, although per capita GNP is now
 approaching $5000 a year, the benefits of the new
 prosperity have accrued largely to a limited number of
 individuals and social groups in the capital area, despite
 some government effort to reverse this trend. There is
 little or no discrimination on the basis of race or ethnic
 origins, and the government actively promotes greater
 freedom for women.
