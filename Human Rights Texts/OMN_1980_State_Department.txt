 SULTANATE OF OMAN
 The human rights situation in Oman during 1980 continued
 the improvement of previous years under the rule of Sultan
 Qaboos. Until he seized power from his father in 1970,
 Oman for derades had been ruled by a leader who opposed
 nearly all manifestations of modern material and cultural
 development. Since 1970, the Sultanate has provided
 its citizens with a freer and more prosperous life
 through programs financed by revenues from its modest
 oil production. These advances have taken place despite
 burdens imposed on the country's financial and human
 resources by the Dhofar insurgency of 1965-1976 and
 continuing regional tensions since that time. The Dhofar
 insurgency was crushed in 1976, but continuing hostility
 of the neighboring People's Democratic Republic of
 Yemen and the recent general increase in tensions in the
 Persian Gulf/Indian Ocean region have caused high levels
 of defense expenditures.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Articles 181, 235-237, and 247-249 of the Omani criminal
 code prohibit torture. These prohibitions appear to be
 observed in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Corporal mutilation is not used as a punishment for crime,
 and the few executions in recent years have been of con-
 victed murderers. The major penal facility is modern in
 design and construction.
 a. Disappearances
 There have been no allegations or reports of disappearances
 in 1980.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest andImprisonment
 Omani law does not specifically include habeas corpus or
 its equivalent, but the criminal code imposes penalties
 for unjustified arrest and detention by the authorities.
 Citizens can petition the courts, the Minister of Justice,
 or the Sultan for remedies in cases of violations of
 their rights. Abuses of the police power of arrest have
 occurred. There are instances of petty arbitariness,
 usually by law enforcement officials in outlying districts
 who exceed their legal mandate. Although the government of
 Oman has neither publicly acknowledged nor denied the
 holding of political prisoners, unsubstantiated reports
 indicate that some insurgents and their sympathizers
 from the period of the Dhofar war still may be under
 detention.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Both Islamic lawand the Omani criminal code call for a
 hearing and a fair trial by experienced judges. Some
 eyewitness accounts have indicated that trials are fair
 while others report procedural bias in favor of the
 prosecution. There may be regional variations in this
 respect.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Warrants are not required for police searches of private
 premises. Such searches appear to be infrequent and to
 involve cases where the government perceives a security
 threat or when smuggling (especially of arms or narcotics)
 is suspected.
 2. Government    Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The economic and cultural changes that have taken place in
 Oman's national life since 1970 derive from the government's
 policies to promote economic growth and to extend social
 services to the public, and the financing of those
 policies made possible by crude oil exports (which peaked
 in 1976 at about 366,000 barrels per day and currently run
 at around 280,000 barrels per. day). Oman's 1980 budget
 anticipated oil revenues of $2.75 billion, but first-half
 1980 oil revenues alone reached roughtly $1.6 billion.
 These and other revenues support an expenditure program
 budgeted for 1980 at $2.8 billion, of which roughly 40
 percent is being spent on a broad range of economic and
 social development programs.
 These programs have brought substantial improvements to
 the lives of most Omanis, but marked disparities of income
 and standard of living still exist. There are persistent
 allegations of corruption or favoritism in the awarding
 of government contracts, although the degree, if any, to
 which resources are thus -iverted from the poor is unknown.
 Oman is a labor-short economy with over 100,000 expatriate
 workers currently in the country. With increasing
 "Omanization" of upper-level positions, Omani workers have
 experienced no difficulties in finding jobs. While
 relatively few women .thus far-have taken jobs in the modern
 sector of the economy, this appears to have been caused
 mainly by their lack of educational opportunities in the
 pre-1970 era, rather than by any current job discrimination.
 A number of women who were able to attain the necessary
 educational level, usually Omanis born and raised abroad,
 currently fill responsible positions in the Omani govern-
 ment and in business establishments.
 Oman is a heterogeneous-society composed of believers in
 three variants of Islam (Ibadhi, Sunni, and Shi'a), of
 various linguistic groups, and of differing racial mixes.
 There appears to be no officially-sanctioned discrimination
 based~on these differences.

 3. Respect for Civil and Politidal Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Oman, especially outside the capital area, remains a
 traditional society in which political communication
 occurs through family, ethnic, tribal, and regional ties.
 There are no elected representative bodies, and freedom
 of the press, assembly, and speech are circumscribed.
 Although the government does not practice prior censor-
 ship, editorials by the media, both private and government-
 owned, almost invariably reflect official views.
 Publications from abroad routinely are censored and
 occasionally banned. There are no restrictions on
 religious practices for the small non-Muslim population.
 Labor unions, on the other hand, do not exist, and
 strikes are forbidden.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Omanis living abroad before 1970 have returned to Oman
 in large numbers since that time and have encountered
 no legal obstacles in so doing. Omanis also may travel
 freely to foreign countries, and many Omanis now work
 abroad, especially in the United Arab Emirates, from
 which they commute on a regular basis. With the exception
 of a few parts of Dhofar Province, there are no restrictions
 on travel by Omanis within the country. The government
 has undertaken an extensive program of road building,
 including a highway linking Dhofar to northern Oman, to
 facilitate such travel. Women are subjected to no
 special travel restrictions and ere free to own and
 operate motor vehicles in Oman.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There are neither political parties nor elections in Oman.
 Sultan Qaboos has indicated that, as the numbers of
 educated Omanis increase, so will popular participation
 in the public life of the nation. But Oman at present
 limits recognition of political rights. Citizens have
 access to government leaders through personal appeal,
 which is sanctioned by Islamic and tribal practice.
 No problems of nationality, citizenship, or statelessness
 appear to exist.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 The government declined to receive a proposed Amnesty
 International mission in 1972 when the Dhofar insurgency
 was at its peak. Since then, there have been no known
 requests by international human rights organizations to
 visit Oman. There are no independent organizations
 based within the country that observe, report, or contest
 human rights violations.
