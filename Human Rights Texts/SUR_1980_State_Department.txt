 SURINAME
 From the time of its independence from the Netherlands
 in November, 1975, until a group of army non-commis- '
 sioned officers (NCOs) staged a military coup in February,
 1980, Suriname was a multi-party constitutional democracy
 with a solid human rights record.
 Just prior to the scheduled March, 1980 election,
 a long-festering problem over unionization within
 the military led to a coup by army NCOs on February
 25, 1980. What had started as a labor dispute quickly
 became highly political as government ministers were
 dismissed and, in some cases, arrested when the army
 took control. While the president remained in office,
 the army suspended partisan political activity and
 replaced the government in March, 1980, with an appointed
 interim civilian government.
 On August 13 a new crisis occurred when the president
 resigned and discovery of a plot by leftist NCOs to
 mount a counter-coup was announced. Prime Minister
 Chin A Sen also assumed the role of president, and
 the army set aside the constitution, suspended parliament,
 and instituted a state of emergency. With the constitution
 no longer in force, in theory all rights guaranteed
 therein have been suspended. In practice the rights
 most affected have been freedom of expression and
 assembly. Special tribunals to try corruption cases
 have been established.
 Elections have been promised before the end of 1982,
 and a new constitution is being drafted, to be submitted
 to the Surinamese people for approval. Respected
 legal experts form the drafting commission, and community
 groups--labor, churches, industry, and other private
 organizations--reportedly will be consulted in the
 drafting process. Senior government officials maintain
 that Suriname still is being administered in accordance
 with the civil and human rights guarantees of the
 former constitution. However, those guarantees no
 longer exist legally, and in some cases their absence
 has resulted in abuses of civil liberties and human
 rights. At the end of 1980, it is unclear how the
 political system and human rights observance will
 evolve.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Inclu-
 ding Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture was prohibited in the suspended constitution.
 There have been no allegations of its use prior to
 or since the February 1980 coup.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The constitution prohibited criel, inhuman or degra-
 ding punishment and it was not practiced. Immediately
 following the February coup, when the military briefly
 assumed responsibility for civil order, some people
 arrested on criminal charges of looting, theft, and
 rape were severely beaten as punishment for their
 
 
 533
 crimes. In the months that followed, allegations
 of coercion or excessive use of force diminished,
 although reports of prisoners being summoned for questioning
 in early morning hours, or held naked for several
 days exposed to insects in unscreened cells, persisted.
 c.   Disappearances
 There are no reports of disappearances.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Government sources state that 26 persons were under
 arrest in late 1980 on corruption charges or on suspicion
 of counter-revolutionary plotting. Other reliable
 observers claim that the number may be as high as
 125. The previous constitution included habeas corpus
 provisions and a fixed limit on investigative detention
 time. It did not include legal provisions for preventive
 detention as such. Present information suggests that
 these principles continue to be applied in criminal
 arrests now. However, in alleged counter-revolutionary
 or corruption cases, or others in which the military
 have taken an active interest since the coup, there
 is no assurance these safeguards will be respected.
 Several counter-coup suspects have been under military
 arrest for some months. Army leaders have said that
 the military men involved will be tried by regular
 courts-martial and that the cases are still under
 investigation. Some arrested for corruption released
 earlier by the attorney general for lack of admissible
 evidence have been rearrested and have remained in
 jail pending trial. These and other defendants have
 been denied access to attorneys.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Accused persons in normal civil and criminal cases
 have received fair public trials both before and since
 the coup. Corruption cases, since then, some of them
 involving high level members of the former government,
 raise questions concerning due process. These cases
 will be tried by special corruptions courts. Official
 statements concerning them appear to assume guilt.
 Possible penalties by the special courts include heavy
 fines, imprisonment for up to 30 years in most serious
 cases, forfeiture of property obtained through corrupt
 practices, and exile.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 Under the former constitution, entry into the home
 required approval of a magistrate upon showing of
 probable cause. Though civil police operate under
 essentially the same restraints as before the coup,
 the military and military police apparently enter
 and search at will, and there have been a few entries
 and searches without warrants. Following the mid-
 August disturbances, overseas telephone and telex
 communications, and some domestic traffic, were openly
 monitored and censored.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education
 
 
 534
 There is compulsory education and all children between
 the ages of six and twelve are entitled to free public
 schooling. A recent World Bank survey estimated that
 Suriname's literacy rate is 80 percent. Although the
 government claims that almost 90 percent of the population
 now has easy access to schools, government findings
 that the literacy rate might be as low as 70 percent
 led to a public outcry and resulted in a government
 pledge to increase its efforts in the educational
 field. Although there has been no legislation regulating
 hiring practices, traditionally there has been little
 racial discrimination. Women have not received equal
 treatment in matters of employment. The government
 is sponsoring a media campaign to promote the equality
 of women and President Chin A Sen placed two women
 in his cabinet.
 Suriname has long had a welfare program for the aged-
 -albeit a limited one. Until recently, those 70 years
 old and over received 25 Surinamese guilders ($14.00)
 per month. The Chin A Sen government raised that
 amount to 50 guilders ($28.00), lowered the qualifying
 .age to 65, and now has announced that as of January 1,
 1981, all persons 60 years of age or over will receive
 75 guilders ($42.00) per month.
 There is no welfare program for the unemployed or
 lowest-paid wcrkers. There is little abject poverty
 in Suriname, in part because of tradition of strong
 family ties and a sense of community. With such an
 informal welfare system functioning, the government
 has been slow to institute a formal, publicly-funded
 program.
 Traditionally, all people were entitled to own property
 in Suriname. Married women, however, could own real
 and other property only under the control of their
 husbands.
 According to World Bank estimates, per capita gross
 national products is approximately $2,000 per year.
 This figure includes, however, all Dutch development
 aid contributions and the large production figures
 generated by the bauxite mining firms. Recent government
 figures showed annual per capita disposable income
 in the largest city, Paramaribo, to be $695; (elsewhere
 in the country $455) per annum.
 Life expectency is 67.2 years among the population
 of approximately 350,000, and the infant mortality
 rate is 37.3 per thousand. There are 45 doctors and
 40.9 hospital beds per 10,000. The inflation rate
 is about 15 percent. Unemployment is officially put
 at 19 percent but estimated unofficially to be as
 high as 30 percent.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech, press and assembly have suffered
 most since the February 25 revolution, and particu-
 larly after August 13. Since then, the assembly of
 more than three persons, without permission from the
 military police, is technically forbidden--though
 in many cases this prohibition is ignored. All political
 
 
 535
 activity has been prohibited since February 25.
 Religion remains unrestricted. The press, however,
 has received sharp reprimands from the military leaders
 for articles considered unfriendly or unjustly critical.
 While there is no formal censorship of the press,
 guidelines have been issued on certain subjects.
 In his press conference following the August 13-15
 events, Army Commander D. Bouterse called for press
 restraint and strongly advised that it say nothing
 to "harm the revolution." Late in the year, the government
 formed a five-man communications policy board to advise
 it on all matters related to the media. While that
 board has not yet taken action to restrict press freedom,
 it at least has the potential to do so.
 Earlier military attempts to influence the academic
 appointment process were successfully rebuffed. There
 have bee4 no reports of harassment of professional
 or scientific groups, though all continue to fall
 under the prohibition on public meetings. The government
 and military also have intervened extensively in labor-
 management relations (from August to early November,
 labor union meetings were prohibited). As a result
 of a strike which paralyzed the services of SLM, the
 national airline, on November 21, a principal labor
 leader was detained for a day. After his release
 on November 22, the government prohibited strikes
 during the existing state of emergency. The strike%
 prohibition was rescinded recently.
 Trade unions, grouped in several confederations, were
 strong and active in influencing public policy prior
 to the suspension of the constitutional system. They
 continue intact, strong and influential, but the ban
 on public meetings since August 1980, extensive government
 and military intervention in labor-management relations,
 and the emergency ban on strikes instituted in November,
 have severely hampered their activities. Unions now
 technically have the right to strike, what this means
 in practice remains to be seen.
 b.   Freedom of Movement within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation.
 There are no restrictions on internal travel or emigration.
 The military earlier acted arbitrarily in some instances
 to prevent the departure from the country of those
 they suspected of corruption or counter-revolutionary
 activity. Currently, some 200 to 250 people connected
 with corruption or counter-revolutionary trials, including
 potential witnesses, have been forbidden to leave
 the country.
 .The government encourages voluntary repatriation,
 and is actively campaigning to increase the return
 of Surinamese from the Netherlands. While Suriname
 was one of the first countries in South America to
 commit itself to southeast Asian refugees, none have
 so far been resettled there. Recent press commentary
 on the subject shows some sentiment against the acceptance
 of refugees on the grounds that the needs of the country's
 current population are so great.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 
 
 536
 All political activity is banned.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Before the February coup, Suriname had adhered to
 the American Convention on Human Rights and was a
 strong supporter of initiatives on human rights in
 the Organization of American States and other inter-
 national bodies. Two Surinamese are members of a
 seven-person International Committee of Jurists (ICJ)-
 sponsored "Standing Committee of Jurists for the Promotion
 of Human Rights in the Caribbean." The university
 faculty and students run an energetic legal assistance
 program. The Caribbean Human Rights and Legal Aid
 Coporation has its secretariat in Suriname; its secretary
 general and vice president both are local law school
 professors. The organization complements the work
 of the more theoretical ICJ Standing Committee. There
 have been no requests for international investigation
 of human rights conditions in Suriname. Nonetheless,
 observers from Amnesty International were in Suriname
 in connection with December's counterrevolutionary
 trials. Press reports indicate they found nothing
 objectionable during their visit. The country was
 suspended from the Inter-Parliamentary Union following
 the abolition of parliament.
