NIGERIA
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
2002 was marked by political tension as Nigeria headed towards elections scheduled
for 2003. A sharp increase in political violence worsened an already poor
human rights situation, characterized by a lack of resolve on the part of the federal
government to bring perpetrators of human rights abuses to justice or to enforce
accountability at the level of state government authorities in Nigeria’s thirty-six
states. Little effective action was taken to stem killings in the context of localized
disputes between different ethnic groups fighting for political control, or to bring
to account members of the security forces (police, military, and the paramilitary
mobile police) responsible for numerous extrajudicial executions and other abuses.
President Olusegun Obasanjo faced increasingly vocal criticism from his opponents,
culminating in impeachment proceedings initiated against him by the
National Assembly in September. The impeachment motion was based on seventeen
charges of breaching the constitution, including the massacre of hundreds of
unarmed civilians by the Nigerian military in Odi, Bayelsa State, in November
1999, and in Benue State in October 2001 (see below); most of the other charges
related to allegations of financial corruption and mismanagement of government
funds.
Local elections initially scheduled for May were postponed until August, then
postponed again indefinitely, due in part to a lack of preparation, including the
absence of an up-to-date voters’ register. A voter registration exercise was eventually
launched in September but was marred by widespread fraud and rigging, and
interference by political party officials. Controversy also surrounded applications
for registration by several new political parties. In addition to the three parties
already recognized—the ruling People’s Democratic Party (PDP), the All Nigeria
People’s Party (ANPP) and the Alliance for Democracy (AD)—applications from a
further three were accepted by the Independent National Electoral Commission
(INEC), bringing to six the total to contest the elections. There was a lack of transparency
as to the criteria for excluding other parties that had applied, several of
which challenged INEC’s decision through the courts.
There were a number of assassinations of high-profile politicians. The most
prominent was Minister of Justice and Attorney General Bola Ige, shot dead in his
home in Ibadan in December 2001. The exact motive for his assassination was not
confirmed, but there was overall consensus that it was of a political nature. Some
observers believed that his death was linked to a political dispute between the governor
and deputy governor of Osun State, Bola Ige’s home state; Bola Ige had been
perceived as a supporter of the governor. The police launched an investigation and
arrested several people. In October 2002, thirteen people were formally charged
with murder and conspiracy to murder, and the trial was about to begin.
The prospect of local government, state, legislative, and presidential elections in
2003 created a climate of intense competition and rivalry at all levels, between current
political office-holders, their opponents, their respective sponsors, and other
would-be candidates.Many resorted to physical violence, threats, and intimidation
to deter their opponents.Local and state government officials, as well as their opponents,
made widespread use of political thugs, militia and other armed groups,
leading to scores of politically-motivated killings. Some of the worst violence took
place within the ruling PDP during its primaries, especially in the south: for example,
dozens of people were killed in Nembe, Bayelsa State, in July 2002, and in other
areas in the Niger Delta. Plateau State, in central Nigeria, also experienced a high
level of violence. Several politicians in other states were also killed for apparently
political motives, such as the chairman of the PDP in Kwara State, killed in August
2002, and the vice-chairman of the United Nigeria People’s Party (UNPP), killed in
Kano in September. Neither a draft bill outlawing political violence, nor federal
government statements condemning political violence, seemed to produce any
effect.
In the southeastern state of Anambra, the chairman of the Onitsha branch of the
National Bar Association, Barnabas Igwe, and his wife were killed in September;
there was strong, credible evidence that they were targeted for political reasons,
because of Igwe’s outspoken criticisms of the state governor.He and other critics of
the governor had received explicit death threats from Anambra State government
officials following public statements in which they had denounced the state government’s
failure to pay the salaries of government workers and had given the governor
an ultimatum to either pay salary arrears or resign.
The vigilante group known as the Bakassi Boys, supported by both the Anambra
and Abia state governments in the southeast, continued to carry out serious human
rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, torture, and unlawful detention of
alleged criminals. These were documented in a detailed report by Human Rights
Watch and the Lagos-based Centre for Law Enforcement Education (CLEEN),
launched in Lagos in May. In August, the police raided several of the Bakassi Boys’
detention centers in Abia State and released scores of people held there illegally. In
September, a similar police operation took place in Anambra State, resulting in
scores of arrests of the Bakassi Boys.Many of those detained by the Bakassi Boys,
and released by the police, had suffered horrific torture and mutilation.
The O’odua People’s Congress (OPC), a Yoruba ethnic militia involved in vigilante
activities in the southwest, was responsible for fewer killings than it had been
in the previous two years; however, it continued to be active and engaged in violent
clashes with the police, as well as with other groups. In January 2002, there was a major clash between the police and the OPC in Owo, in Ondo State, in which the
police ambushed a large convoy of OPC members and killed and arrested dozens
of them. The OPC had previously been involved in several incidents of violence in
Owo in the context of a dispute over a local chieftaincy position.
President Obasanjo put forward to the National Assembly a draft bill outlawing
ethnic militia. The wording of the bill was ill-defined and there were fears that, if
passed into law, the sweeping powers it would grant to the president could be
abused to outlaw a broad range of organizations, including some that might not use
or advocate violence, but could be targeted on the basis of their perceived opposition
to the government.
The police carried out many extrajudicial executions, often shooting suspected
criminals on sight, and, in some cases, killing or injuring other individuals who
were not suspected of any crime.The federal government and the inspector general
of police promised to address these problems and to stamp out the widespread corruption
in the police force.However, some of the initiatives they launched, such as
“Operation Fire for Fire,” which was intended to tackle the high rate of violent
crime, seemed to have the opposite effect and resulted in further shootings of suspects
by the police,many of them fatal.The police force itself stated that at least 225
criminal suspects had been shot dead between March and June 2002.
The police were frequently involved in arbitrary arrests and detentions, often
motivated by attempts to collect bribes. Some of these problems could be attributed
to the very poor working conditions of the police, including low rates of pay, insufficient
resources and equipment, and inadequate training—all of which culminated
in an unprecedented police strike in January. The public continued to have
very little confidence in the police to maintain law and order. Likewise, the justice
system failed to deliver on many counts. Perpetrators of human rights abuses were
rarely successfully prosecuted. It was estimated that more than two thirds of
detainees in prisons and detention centers around the country were held awaiting
trial, sometimes without charge, in some cases for several years. Conditions of
detention remained very poor and ill-treatment and torture of detainees were
widespread.
No action was taken to prosecute those responsible for ordering and carrying
out the October 2001 massacre of more than two hundred civilians and widespread
destruction by the military in several towns and villages in Benue State. A commission
of inquiry, set up to study the conflicts in Benue, Taraba, Plateau, and
Nasarawa states, began holding hearings in May. However, no criminal investigation
into the military massacre was even begun. Senior government and military
officials, including President Obasanjo himself, refused to acknowledge that the
actions of the military in Benue constituted a grave human rights violation; instead,
they continued to justify the operation. President Obasanjo publicly dismissed a
detailed report by Human Rights Watch on the Benue massacre, published in April,
and gave no indication that he would order any criminal investigation into these
events.
Inter-communal violence continued in many parts of the country. There were
several outbreaks of violence in Plateau State, where scores of people were killed
between May and July in several local government areas. In February, more than seventy people were killed in Idi-Araba, an area of Lagos, in clashes between the
Yoruba and Hausa ethnic groups; the OPC was reported to have been involved in
the violence. The police were typically absent or overstretched during such disturbances,
or else intervened once most of the violence had subsided; in some cases,
their participation aggravated the situation as they were seen to be taking sides. In
many cases, local politicians and other influential figures in the local communities
appeared to be responsible for fuelling inter-communal violence and mobilizing
youths to fight.
There were continuing tensions in the oil-producing areas of the Niger Delta,
often aggravated by the actions ofmultinational oil companies. Local communities
were resentful of the absence of significant benefits for ordinary people from the
continuing exploitation of natural resources, most of the profits being siphoned off
by politicians. Communities staged several protests at oil facilities to demand a
greater share of resources and better employment and infrastructure for the local
population. For ten days in July, several hundred women occupied Chevron’s
Escravos terminal, demanding the oil company address their grievances. In October
Human Rights Watch published a report describing the ongoing human rights
problems connected with oil production, including extrajudicial executions and
other abuses by the security forces deployed in the Delta, and the role of oil companies
in exacerbating inter-communal disputes.
In many of the northern states, the increasingly widespread application of shari’a
(Islamic law) in criminal cases led to the imposition of sentences amounting to
cruel, inhuman and degrading punishments, often after unfair trials. Due process
was rarely observed.Defendants, many of whom came from poor and uneducated
backgrounds,were not informed about their rights and often did not have access to
legal representation. Judges and other court officials were poorly trained. January
2002 saw the first execution since shari’a began to be extended to cover criminal law
in 1999: A man tried in Katsina State was hanged after being found guilty of murdering
a woman and her two children.He was not represented by a lawyer and had
not appealed the sentence. Several other people were sentenced to death by stoning,
although the sentences were not carried out.These included two women sentenced
for adultery. One of them, Safiya Husseini in Sokoto State, had her conviction set
aside by the appeal court.However, the other,Amina Lawal in Katsina State, had her
death sentence confirmed by the appeal court. A couple (a man and a woman) were
also sentenced to death by stoning for adultery in Niger State, while a man found
guilty of raping a child faced the same sentence in Jigawa State.Defendants tried by
shari’a courts faced a range of other sentences, including floggings and amputations,
some of which were carried out. President Obasanjo publicly stated that he
was not in favor of sentences of death by stoning, but did not take any action to prevent
such sentences from being handed down. In March, newly-appointed Minister
of Justice Kanu Agabi wrote to the governors of the states which apply shari’a,
asking them to review its application on the grounds that it was unconstitutional
and discriminatory against Muslims.However, none of the governors are known to
have followed his request.
In addition to the discrimination against women evident in some of the sentencing
by shari’a courts (for example, in the cases of Safiya Husseini and Amina Lawal, the men allegedly involved in the adultery were acquitted), women across
Nigeria suffered a range of other serious abuses. Trafficking of women, as well as
children (both girls and boys), for prostitution and labor, remained a serious problem.
Nigeria was a critical country for the human trafficking trade, as a receiving
country, as a country of origin, and as a transit route for traffickers. Initiatives set
up by the government to try to stem the trade seemed to have little effect.Women
also suffered discrimination in terms of inheritance rights, especially in the southeast,
and were made to undergo humiliating widowhood rites.However, a number
of states took measures to end this discrimination; Oyo became the third state to
adopt a law granting widows inheritance rights. Female genital mutilation
remained widespread, although several states have adopted laws prohibiting it.
The Human Rights Violations Investigation Commission, known as the Oputa
Panel, set up in 1999 to investigate human rights abuses committed under previous
Nigerian governments since 1966, presented its final report to the government in
May. President Obasanjo undertook to implement its recommendations; however,
by October , neither the commission’s report nor its recommendations had been
made public, nor had the government announced details of how it would implement
the recommendations.
Nigeria acceded to the Mine Ban Treaty on September 27, 2001. Antipersonnel
mines were among the debris found after a massive explosion at a military ammunition
depot in Ikeja, in Lagos, in January 2002, which killed hundreds of people.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Many nongovernmental organizations continued to work actively to promote
human rights, including through human rights education, advocacy, and reporting
on human rights violations.Most of them intensified their activities in preparation
for the 2003 elections and developed programs to raise public awareness of voter
rights and election-related issues, and prevent political violence.
Members of the human rights organizations Human Rights Monitor and the
Civil Liberties Organisation faced harassment by the State Security Services in connection
with their individual contributions to research and report-writing on the
Benue massacres. Copies of a book on impunity and state-sponsored violence in
Nigeria, published by CLEEN and the World Organisation Against Torture, were
blocked at customs from entering Nigeria because of the book’s “perceived political
undertone.”
The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), set up by the government
in 1996, continued to monitor human rights developments and advise the government
on human rights policies. It investigated and intervened on a number of individual
cases; however, its broader impact remained limited, in part due to
insufficient resources. The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office funded a
new program of volunteers to work with the NHRC to develop its work on several
priority themes, including the environment, communal conflicts and extrajudicial
killings, and prisons.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
The United States,United Kingdom and other Western governments continued
to view Nigeria as a key ally in Africa in the “war against terrorism,” especially in
view of its large Muslim population. These political considerations led to a reluctance
to criticize Nigeria’s human rights record. Overall, foreign governments
remained silent on the range of serious human rights abuses taking place in Nigeria,
with the exception of the sentences of death by stoning under shari’a, which
were widely condemned at the international level, by government officials, parliamentarians
and nongovernmental organizations in several world regions.
United Kingdom
The U.K. continued to be among the most influential Western governments in
relation to Nigeria and a strong supporter of President Obasanjo. The British government
strengthened its relationship with Nigeria in the context of the New Partnership
for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), an initiative led by President Obasanjo
and several other African heads of state to seek international support for development
in Africa. There were several visits to Nigeria by U.K. government officials,
including by Prime Minister Tony Blair in February, during which he re-asserted
his support for NEPAD; however, he did not publicly raise human rights issues with
the Nigerian government. The British government failed to condemn publicly the
massacres by the Nigerian military in Benue in October 2001.
The U.K. Department for International Development launched a seven-year
program of assistance to the Nigerian justice system, entitled Access to Justice,
which covered all aspects of the justice sector, including the Nigerian courts, the
prison service and the police, and long-term reform of these institutions. The program
was set up at federal level and in the states of Jigawa, Benue, Ekiti, and Enugu.
In terms of police reform, it included a human rights component in policing and
suggested alternative techniques to some of those currently used by the Nigerian
police, for example to limit excessive use of force. A British police adviser was to
work full-time with the Nigerian Ministry of Police Affairs and the office of the
inspector general of police.
European Union
The E.U. was a major donor and had a seven-year plan for assistance to Nigeria,
for the period 2001 to 2007.The program,which would concentrate on Abia,Cross
River, Gombe, Kebbi, Osun, and Plateau states, focused on two main sectors:
improvement of service delivery, especially water and sanitation, and state and local
institutional and economic reform. The program also included support for
strengthening democracy and human rights, and stressed the role of civil society in
ensuring popular participation in decision-making.
United States
Alongside the U.K, the U.S. was Nigeria’s principal backer and donor in the West.
The U.S. government provided assistance to Nigeria in a range of sectors.Assistance
and training for the Nigerian police and the National Drug Law Enforcement
Agency (NDLEA), including police reform and assistance to combat drug trafficking
and corruption, was channeled through the U.S State Department’s Bureau of
International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs and totaled U.S.$2 million
for fiscal year 2002. A separate program by the U.S. Justice Department’s International
Criminal Training and Assistance Program (ICITAP) was designed to focus
on the physical and operational rehabilitation of the Nigerian police, as well as support
for the National Assembly and nongovernmental organizations. The U.S.
Agency for International Development (USAID) had a budget of almost $80 million
for assistance to Nigeria.
Assistance to the Nigerian military, to include defense reform and training for
peacekeeping operations, was budgeted at $6 million for fiscal year 2002, while
$750,000 was budgeted for U.S. training of Nigerian military under the International
Military Education and Training (IMET) program. The U.S. Congress also
approved $26 million for the West African Stability Fund, part of the U.S.’s voluntary
peacekeeping operations budget; however, the disbursement of the proportion
of this money allocated to Nigeria was put on hold following objections by the head
of the Senate Foreign Relations Africa Subcommittee, who opposed military assistance
to Nigeria until the government had taken steps to enforce accountability for
the killings by the military in Benue in 2001.
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Walter Kansteiner visited Nigeria in
July but failed to raise human rights issues publicly, focusing instead on Nigeria’s
key role as an oil producer and encouraging it to increase its production (Nigeria
was the fifth largest supplier of oil to the U.S.). The U.S. State Department planned
to post an officer in the embassy in Abuja with responsibility for following issues of
corporate responsibility in Nigeria.
The U.S. State Department’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2001
provided an accurate and comprehensive description of the situation in Nigeria. It
noted numerous killings by the security forces and violence during inter-communal
conflicts; however, it did not adequately stress the government’s continuing
failure to investigate these abuses or take preventive action, especially with regard
to the military massacre in Benue—the most serious human rights incident involving
the security forces during the period covered.
World Bank
In March the World Bank approved two loans to the Nigerian government,
totaling U.S.$237 million, for the development of the health system and a community-
based urban development project. It also announced a $25 million technical
assistance loan to the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) for a community
action program.
