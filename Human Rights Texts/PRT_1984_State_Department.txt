 PORTUGAL
 Since Portugal's peaceful transition from authoritarian to
 democratic rule in 1974, vigorous democratic institutions have
 been established, and Portugal today enjoys a pluralistic,
 multiparty, parliamentary democracy with broad popular
 legitimacy. The Government is appointed by the President and
 dependent upon support of Parliament. Members of Parliament
 and the President of the Republic are freely elected by the
 people. The young democracy was consolidated in 1982 with the
 abolition of the Council of the Revolution, which had provided
 the military a role in overseeing government acts.
 The 1982 revision of the Constitution not only consolidated
 the guarantees of civil liberties contained in the 1976
 Constitution but also allowed for a more open economy.
 Nationalizations and agrarian reform immediately after the
 1974 revolution established the primary role of the state in
 certain areas of commerce, industry, and agriculture. In 1984
 the Government began to implement its 1983 economic reform
 program, designed to open the nationalized banking and other
 sectors to competition from private enterprise, by authorizing
 the operation of one private domestic and two private foreign
 banks.
 Portugal has not had a civilian intelligence service since the
 abolition of the secret police structure in 1974. In 1984, a
 law establishing new military and civilian intelligence
 services was passed. An Armenian terrorist attack on the
 Turkish Embassy in 1983, the assassination of Palestine
 Liberation Organization representative Issam Sartawi at a
 Socialist International conference in Portugal the same year,
 and a number of domestic terrorist acts in 1984 convinced the
 Portuguese Government that the creation of these agencies was
 necessary.
 A spate of terrorist activity aimed primarily at Portuguese
 businessmen has not altered the healthy human rights climate,
 although there have been unsubstantiated charges that prison
 conditions for the approximately 50 persons arrested and
 awaiting trial for terrorist activity are substandard. There
 have also been periodic foreign and domestic complaints about
 lengthy delays in the handling of cases in the Portuguese
 courts. :Respect for civil and political rights, due process,
 and the integrity of the person are supported by the
 Government and reinforced by a vigilant free press. The
 state-owned national television network on occasion has
 tailored its programming in accord with political
 considerations. But opposing points of view can be and
 usually are aired.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Government-sanctioned political killings do not occur in
 Portugal. The domestic terrorist group, the 'Popular Forces
 of April 25" (FP-25--the date refers to the Revolution of
 April 25, 1974), claimed credit for several murders, other
 armed attacks on Portuguese nationals, and numerous bombings
 of industrial and other sites. In almost every case, the
 FP-25's targets were Portuguese businessmen who, the group
 
 
 1071
 PORTUGAL
 later claimed, had been mistreating Portuguese workers in
 various ways. Despite FP-25's activity, Portugal continues to
 enjoy a relatively low level of violence. Common crimes
 against the person are rare. There is generally a high degree
 of mutual tolerance and respect for others.
 b. Disappearance
 The police and the armed forces do not abduct or secretly
 arrest and detain individuals. In 1984, there were no
 terrorist abductions or hostage-takings by Portuguese
 opposition groups.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution forbids torture and the use of evidence
 obtained by torture in criminal proceedings. Torture does not
 exist in Portugal. The Constitution also prohibits cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, which is
 punishable by fine or imprisonment. There has been no
 convincing evidence of such treatment or punishment since
 November 1975. A number of the FP-25 suspects apprehended and
 indicted in 1984 engaged in a 6-week hunger strike in prison
 in protest against what they alleged to be an inhumane prison
 regime. However, no other evidence in support of their
 allegations has been adduced.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 No one can be held legally for more than 48 hours unless a
 prosecuting judge orders preventive detention, which may last
 a maximum of 4 months for each alleged crime. Since November
 1975, individuals in a few cases have been held longer than 48
 hours without being charged. In those cases, defense lawyers
 were able to obtain due process for their clients through
 legal efforts and publicity. Preventive detention for from 6
 to 9 months before trial is not unusual for individuals
 accused of serious crimes, such as murder or armed robbery. A
 large backlog of cases in the courts and vacant judgeships
 have caused trial delays. Judges are required to give
 priority to the cases of those under preventive detention.
 The use of arrest warrants, widely observed in practice, is
 legally mandatory unless the police apprehend someone in the
 act of committing a crime for which he is liable to
 imprisonment for at least 3 years. Habeas corpus is provided
 for by the Constitution but is seldom used in practice owing
 to tradition and to the law on preventive detention. The law
 provides for bail when feasible, but its use is unusual in
 cases of persons accused of serious crimes. Those arrested
 have the right to be informed of the charges against them and
 to be allowed access to a lawyer of their choice.
 Court-appointed defenders are available to those who cannot
 afford to hire an attorney. The Constitution does not provide
 for exile. Forced labor does not exist.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Portugal has an independent judiciary and a fair judicial
 system. All trials are public except those which may offend
 the dignity of the victim, such as cases involving the sexual
 abuse of children. The accused is presumed innocent until
 convicted. A public prosecutor develops the case against the
 
 
 1072
 PORTUGAL
 accused. A prosecuting judge reviews the evidence and
 determines whether the alleged offense merits prosecuting and,
 if so, whether the accused should be detained or released on
 bail. A panel of three judges (not to include the prosecuting
 judge) presides over cases which go to trial. A ministerial
 delegate assists the judges in reviewing the evidence. A jury
 may be used at the request of the accused in trials for major
 crimes. The judge(s) or jury renders the verdict. Sentence
 may be passed only in the presence of the defense attorney.
 There have been foreign and domestic complaints about lengthy
 delays in the handling of cases in Portuguese courts. The
 European Court in Strasbourg in July 1984 found that Portugal
 had violated Article 6 of the European Convention on Human
 Rights providing that 'every person has the right to have his
 case disposed of justly and publicly within a reasonable
 time." This judgment concerned a case involving a civil suit
 brotght before Portuguese courts several years earlier by a
 Portuguese national.
 There are no political prisoners, although the extreme left
 often charges that persons sentenced to prison for violent
 acts, conspiracy, or incitement to violence are political
 prisoners. Some foreign and domestic groups have charged that
 FP-25 detainees, particularly Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho, one
 of the leaders of the 1974 revolution, are political
 prisoners. However, there is no evidence to substantiate
 those charges.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 No cases of governmental interference with the privacy of the
 individual occurred in 1984. There has been no generalized
 governmental monitoring of correspondence or telephones or use
 of a system of informers since 1974. The Constitution forbids
 forced entry into homes and searches without a judicial
 warrant. In addition, entry into an individual's home at
 night requires his consent.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is guaranteed under the
 Constitution and fully suppported by the Government. The
 constitutionally mandated Council of Social Communication, the
 members of which are elected by the Parliament, acts as a
 watchdog to protect freedom of speech and access to the
 media. It publicizes abuses, makes recommendations to the
 Parliament, and has enforcement powers (which have never been
 exercised). The opposition is freeto voice its point of
 view, and the Government tolerates criticism with two
 restrictions.
 First, 'Fascist" organizations and activities, including
 discussion of corporativism, are prohibited by the so-called
 'anti-Fascist' law of June 1978. Violators are liable to
 imprisonment for a period of from 2 to 8 years. In practice,
 however, politicians associated with the former regime freely
 engage in political activity, and there have been no "Fascist'
 prosecutions. No laws prohibit or restrict the political
 activity of extreme leftists.
 
 
 1073
 PORTUGAL
 Second, anyone convicted of *insulting' civil or military
 bodies or the President of the Republic, if the "insult' was
 intended to undermine the rule of law, may be imprisoned for
 up to 3 years. There were no prosecutions for "insult' in
 1984.
 The Portuguese Government acquired indirect ownership of a
 significant portion of the country's newspapers when it
 nationalized the banks, to which they had become heavily
 indebted. Although the Government subsidizes the press, it
 does not control editorial content, and the entire political
 spectrum is represented. Nevertheless, some observers have
 claimed government use of financial pressure without having
 been able to present convincing evidence for their allegations.
 The two television channels and most radio stations are owned
 by the state. The Government appoints their administrators,
 who usually change with the governments. In principle, the
 Government should not influence their policies or decisions on
 reporting and usually does not do so directly. In 1984,
 however, a controversial television documentary on Angola was
 delayed for 6 months due to strong opposition from the
 Portuguese Communist Party and pressure by the Angolan
 Government. An outcry among journalists, civil libertarians,
 and democratic opposition parties resulted in eventual
 broadcast of the program.
 Opposition parties sometimes charge that television Or radio
 ignores or distorts their views or activities. The Communist
 Party is most vocal in this regard. However, political
 parties, trade unions, and other organizations have a right to
 periodic access to exclusive television time after the evening
 news. The Communist Party and unions use it vigorously.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Individuals have the right, in law and practice, to associate
 formally or informally, to promote non-violent causes, and to
 protest government policies. Formation of a political party
 requires 5,000 subscribers. Public meetings or protests
 require 24-hour advance notice to the civil governor of the
 area involved. Permission is routinely granted.
 Workers have the constitutional right to set up unions by
 profession or industry. Strikes are permitted for any,
 including political, reasons. Approximately 45 percent of the
 workers are unionized. Unions are free of governmental
 control but closely associated with political parties. There
 are two labor federations. One, the General Confederation of
 Portuguese Workers, is controlled by the Communist Party and
 active in Communist-sponsored causes. The other, the General
 Union of Workers, is a pluralist democratic union affiliated
 with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and
 the European Trade Union Congress. Its leadership is
 associated with the Socialist and Social Democratic Parties,
 and several members have been elected to the Parliament.
 There are no legal or practical restrictions on union
 relations with international labor bodies. Since both
 federations want to represent Portugal in the International
 Labor Organization, the Minister of Labor has decided that
 each will do so in alternate years.

 6. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Portugal and the Government does
 nothing to discourage or to interfere with the free practice
 of religion, including missionary work and religious
 publishing. Organized religions may freely establish places
 of worship, train their clergy, proselytize, and convert. In
 order to qualify as a tax-exempt institution, an organized
 religion must legally establish itself as a non-profit,
 private society.
 The prevailing religion is Roman Catholicism. Catholic
 religious instruction is offered as an elective in the public
 schools. Pursuit of a civil, military, professional, or
 political career does not depend on adherence to a particular
 creed.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of movement, foreign
 travel, and emigration. There are no formal restraints on
 domestic travel, on the right of a citizen to change residence
 or place of employment, or on emigration. However, currency
 restrictions, resulting from a chronic balance of payments
 problem, in practice impose some limitations on foreign
 travel. Emigrants and those who travel abroad are free to
 return. Citizenship is not revoked for political reasons.
 A law of August 1980 established a humane refugee program.
 Displaced persons who qualify as refugees under the technical
 definition established by the United Nations are given
 permanent resident status and allowed to work. In practice,
 no displaced persons are forced to return to the land from
 which they have fled or in which they fear persecution.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The President and Parliament are elected by secret ballot and
 universal adult suffrage under a democratic system.
 Opposition parties and candidates operate freely and enjoy
 access to the media. Only "Fascist' organizations are
 outlawed. General elections for the Parliament are held at
 least every 4 years. The President has a 5-year mandate and
 may serve no more than two consecutive terms.
 The population is overwhelmingly European and ethnically
 homogeneous. There is a small African minority, most of whom
 immigrated to Portugal when the former African colonies won
 their independence following the 1974 revolution. There are
 no legal restrictions on political activity by Portuguese of
 African heritage.
 Section 4 Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Portugal has cooperated with independent outside
 investigations of human rights conditions and actively
 participates in the monitoring of human rights by the Council
 of Europe. Amnesty International and other private
 
 
 1075
 PORTUGAL
 international human rights groups operate freely in Portugal.
 The most important domestic human rights group is the
 Portuguese section of the International Commission of Jurists,
 which considers the human rights situation in Portugal to be
 "on the whole, positive and satisfactory.' In its 1984
 report, Amnesty International did not mention Portugal.
 Freedom House rates Portugal 'free.*
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 According to W6ild Bank data, Portugal's population is
 10,045,000, and per capita gross national product is $2446.
 Current life expectancy at birth is 71.7 years, and the infant
 mortality rate is 21.7 per 1,000 live births. The Government
 has instituted a large-scale school construction program to
 improve educational opportunities. Free primary school
 education is now available throughout the country. New
 regional colleges are spreading higher education beyond the
 traditional centers of Coimbra, Lisbon, and Oporto.
 Portugal currently imports about 60 percent of its food
 needs. A worsening of the economic situation, including
 deficits in both the balance of payments and domestic budget,
 has forced the Government to reduce its subsidization of basic
 food and agricultural commodities. Food, shelter, health
 care, and education are available to all inhabitants
 regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic background, or
 political opinion.
 The Civil Code guarantees full legal equality to women in
 accordance with the Constitution. Portugal was one of the
 first signatories of the UN Convention on the Elimination of
 All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. In 1979, a woman
 served as Prime Minister. Five women at present serve as
 secretaries of state (deputy ministers) in the national
 Government. Women play an active role in the political
 parties but remain underrepresented in party and government
 leadership positions. They are gradually increasing their
 representation in business, government, and the professions.
