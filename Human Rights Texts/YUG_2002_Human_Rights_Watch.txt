FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA
SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
The December 2000 Serbian parliamentary elections consolidated the transition
from the authoritarian rule of former president Slobodan Milosevic, with the
Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) winning 64 percent of the vote. In Montenegro,
the early elections in April 2001 served as an informal referendum about
the status of the smaller of the two Yugoslav republics. Pro-independence parties
only won slightly over half the votes, less than generally anticipated, but the ruling
coalition continued to boycott the work of the federal institutions. The authorities
in Serbia and Montenegro made little progress toward solving the federal constitutional
crisis, but the real risk of armed conflict under the Milosevic government
gave way to a political process.
On April 1, Serb authorities arrested Milosevic on corruption charges. Faced
with mounting pressure from human rights organizations, the United States, and
the European Union to surrender Milosevic for war-crimes prosecution before the
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY),Yugoslav President
Vojislav Kostunica and other officials argued that Milosevic’s transfer required
adoption of a law on cooperation with the ICTY first.The Yugoslav Ministry of Justice
drafted a law in June, but the Montenegrin partner in the federal coalition government,
the Socialist People’s Party (SNP), blocked its adoption. On June 23, the
cabinet, dominated by DOS members, adopted a cooperation decree in lieu of the
law. The Federal Constitutional Court, filled with appointees from the Milosevic era, stayed application of the decree while examining its constitutionality. To avoid
the emerging political and legal gridlock, the government of Serbia transferred
Milosevic to The Hague on June 28, invoking the Statute of the Tribunal and the
Constitution of Serbia as the legal basis.
Progress on accountability for wartime abuses was otherwise disappointing.
Serbian authorities arrested and surrendered to the tribunal indicted Bosnian Serb
Milomir Stakic on March 23, and Bosnian Serb brothers Nenad and Pedrag
Banovic on November 9. Blagoje Simic, another Bosnian Serb living in Serbia, surrendered
himself to the tribunal under pressure from the Serbian government, as
did retired General Pavle Strugar and former naval commander Miodrag Jokic,
who both had been indicted for crimes committed in Dubrovnik in 1991. Nonetheless,
at the time of this writing, at least four senior Yugoslav and Serb officials or
former officials remained at liberty in Serbia who were charged with crimes against
humanity committed by troops under their command in Kosovo, along with three
Yugoslav Army officials indicted on charges relating to the destruction of Vukovar
and two other officers indicted for crimes committed at Dubrovnik.
Public debate on crimes committed by Serb forces in Kosovo and Bosnia slowly
started in 2001. Between June and September, the police exhumed five mass graves
in Serbia, containing more than three hundred bodies thought to be Kosovo Albanians
killed by the police and the army during the 1999 NATO bombardment. In
an unprecedented move, the state-run television showed a BBC documentary
about the 1995 killings of more than 7,000 Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica.
In contrast to the Milosevic era, the political opposition in Serbia could openly
express its views and operate free of government harassment.The new government
initiated criminal investigations into corruption and other charges against dozens
of former Milosevic cronies, with the proceedings apparently driven by the
demands of the rule of law rather than by political revanchism. Only one of these
cases had proceeded to trial as of October, resulting in convictions for former head
of Serbian State Security Radomir Markovic and two of his closest collaborators.
Their trial was closed to the public on grounds of state security, raising questions
about the fairness of the proceedings.
The Serbian parliament replaced fifty-seven of two hundred presidents of
municipal courts by July 2001, substantially clearing the judiciary of Milosevic
appointees. Although the new government stopped short of exerting direct pressure
on the judiciary, well-known judges repeatedly complained that pro-government
media and some politicians obstructed judicial independence by publicly
recommending criminal prosecutions and “appropriate” punishments.
An amnesty law adopted in February covered Kosovo Albanians convicted for
seditious conspiracy and armed rebellion, but not those convicted on terrorism
charges.When Slobodan Milosevic was ousted from power in October 2000, 850
Kosovo Albanian prisoners detained during the 1999 Kosovo war remained in Serbian
prisons. By August 2001, an estimated 225 Kosovo Albanian prisoners
remained, an estimated fifty of whom had been sentenced for political reasons in
unfair trials.
The new Serbian government generally respected freedom of expression. Some
media were closer to one or the other party in the political conflict between nationalist Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica and pro-Western Serbian Prime Minister
Zoran Djindjic, but neither leader directly controlled the state-run media or
major private outlets.
The media in Montenegro generally operated free of government intrusion. In
a surprising setback, on September 3, a court in Podgorica convicted the editor of
the opposition daily Dan on a charge of criminal libel and handed down a suspended
five-month prison sentence. The newspaper had published a series of
articles on cigarette smuggling, implicating a businessman associated with Montenegrin
President Milo Djukanovic.
The police practice of so-called informative talks, much abused during the
Milosevic era, occasionally reappeared in 2001. On May 29, State Security agents
interrogated student Milos Cvorovic, an activist in a nongovernmental group in
Belgrade, about his contacts with Kosovo Albanians. A reporter from Valjevo with
the daily Blic, Predrag Radojevic, was taken to the police station on July 12 for an
“informative talk” about his work as a journalist. Radojevic had written a series of
articles during the previous months on the presence of the mafia in the town. Blic’s
editor-in-chief Veselin Simonovic was also interrogated on August 14, following
the publication of an article about a former State Security agent who was killed on
August 3.
The authorities in Belgrade made positive steps toward reducing ethnic tensions
in the Presevo valley,where ethnic Albanians were a majority of the population.As
a result of months-long negotiations, armed Albanian groups there voluntarily disbanded
in May, and civilian life began returning to normal. At the end of May the
first multiethnic police patrols were deployed in the area, following a short training
course under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE).Two more courses were completed by mid-July.Nearly 4,000 of the
estimated 15,000 local Albanians who had left their homes during and after the
1999 Kosovo conflict returned in June and July 2001.
Police brutality against Roma was a common occurrence in 2001. On September
22, two policemen broke the arm of a fourteen-year-old boy in Novi Sad after
beating him and a group of other Roma children. Police in Leskovac detained Daka
Zekic, a seventy-six-year-old Roma for two days in January, deprived him of food
and water, and subjected him to beatings and racial insults. On March 5, four
policemen beat and uttered racial insults against Miroslav Milic, a Roma teenager
from Belgrade. On May 7, three police officers in Backa Topola beat up and uttered
racial slurs against two Roma villagers, Stevan Brancic and Sasa Gojkov. In a positive
development that may help counter these abuses, the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia acceded to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National
Minorities on May 11.
According to a large-scale recount of refugees in the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, 390,000 persons from Croatia and Bosnia were registered as refugees, a
30 percent drop from 1996 figures. The government failed to support the return of
Serb refugees to their pre-war homes in Croatia and Bosnia, while facilitating Serb
refugee integration in Yugoslavia. The Serbian commissioner for refugees stated
that between 230,000 and 250,000 internally displaced persons from Kosovo also
lived in Serbia proper.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
With the one known exception of the police interrogation of Milos Cvorovic,
human rights activists carried out their activities free of government intrusion.
The positive change reflected the fact that several human rights and minority
rights advocates, including federal ministers Goran Svilanovic,Momcilo Grubac,
and Rasim Ljajic, assumed prominent positions in the government. The Humanitarian
Law Center continued to be the leading source of reliable information on
the treatment of Roma, police brutality, and violations committed by all parties
in Kosovo. Among other leading human rights groups were the Helsinki Committee
for Human Rights, the Belgrade Center for Human Rights, the Yugoslav
Lawyers’ Committee for Human Rights, and the Leskovac Council for Human
Rights.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
On November 1, 2000, the General Assembly approved admission of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia to membership in the United Nations. Yugoslav efforts
toward a peaceful settlement of the crisis in the Presevo valley won praise from the
Security Council in December 2000 and from the U.N. Commission on Human
Rights in April 2001.The commission expressed its concern at the continued detention
in Serbia of Kosovo Albanian political prisoners, however, and replaced the
long-standing mandate of its special rapporteur for human rights in the former
Yugoslavia with a special representative to examine the situation of human rights
in Yugoslavia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The special representative, Jose
Cutileiro, visited Yugoslavia at the end of August and the beginning of September.
Examining the first individual petition from Yugoslavia, the Committee against
Torture concluded on May 11 that Yugoslavia had violated its obligations under the
Convention against Torture since its government agencies had failed to investigate
promptly and effectively allegations regarding the torture ofMilan Ristic,who died
in February 1995 of injuries inflicted by the police.
The Federal Republic ofYugoslavia signed the Statute of the International Criminal
Court on December 19, 2000, and it ratified the statute on September 6, 2001.
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
Yugoslavia,which was suspended from the OSCE in July 1992, became a participating
state following a decision by the OSCE Permanent Council on November
10, 2000.An International Election Observation Mission, including representatives
of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and
the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, concluded that the December 2000 elections in
Serbia were conducted in line with accepted international standards. An ODIHR mission also monitored the April 22 elections in Montenegro and found the entire
electoral process transparent. On March 16, the OSCE opened a mission office in
Belgrade.
Council of Europe
On November 9, 2001, Yugoslavia applied for Council of Europe membership.
In January, the Parliamentary Assembly granted special guest status to the Federal
Assembly of Yugoslavia and adopted conditions for membership. Among other
conditions, it called on Yugoslavia to cooperate fully with the ICTY and to surrender
war crimes suspects, to carry out legislative reforms including the abolition of
the death penalty, and to amnesty political prisoners. On March 16, a Council of
Europe office was opened in Belgrade for a renewable one-year term. The Parliamentary
Assembly representatives who made up part of the International Election
Observation Mission that monitored the December 23, 2000, parliamentary election
in Serbia praised the way in which they were conducted. A delegation from the
Parliamentary Assembly also observed and positively assessed the elections in
Montenegro in April 2001.
European Union
After the fall of Slobodan Milosevic in October 2000, the European Union provided
200 million euros (U.S. $168 million) to help Serbia with electricity, heating
fuel, and food payments during the winter. On February 27, 2001, European Union
foreign ministers lifted all sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
since 1998, except the financial, trade, and travel restrictions on firms and individuals
connected to the Milosevic regime. On April 10, the European Commission
allocated the first part of a 240 million euros aid program for Yugoslavia to support
energy supply, healthcare, agriculture, and medium-sized companies. Included in
that sum was the allocation of 49.5 million euros for human rights projects. In mid-
July, the Council of Ministers invested 300 million euros in macro financial aid for
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, consisting of 225 million euros in loans and 75
million euros in grants.
While E.U. bodies called on the new authorities in Belgrade to cooperate with
the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, they failed to condition
financial assistance on the country’s cooperation. The European Parliament
called on the Yugoslav government to release all political prisoners by presidential
pardon or on the basis of an amnesty law.
In November of 2001, the European Union and a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
Consultative Task Force met in Belgrade to discuss various topics, including democracy,
human rights and minority issues as well as regional cooperation and compliance
with international obligations. The commissioner for external relations,
Chris Patton, visited the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in October.The two parties
hoped to initiate discussions that would draw the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
closer to the European Union. Further meetings were expected in 2002.
United States
The U.S.Congress prohibited the continuation of economic aid to Belgrade past
March 31, 2001, unless Yugoslavia arrested and transferred those indicted by the
war crimes tribunal to its custody, cut off economic assistance to the Bosnian Serb
army, and took steps in democratization and minority protection. The conditionality
placed considerable pressure on Serb and Yugoslav authorities and contributed
to the eleventh-hour detention of Slobodan Milosevic on April 1. On April
2, the secretary of state certified the conditions for continued aid were present but
stressed that the United States’ support for the holding of an international donors
conference for Yugoslavia would depend on the country’s continued progress
toward full cooperation with the tribunal. Lack of progress and the refusal of the
United States to participate led to a postponement of the conference from May 31
to the end of June. On the eve of the conference, Serbian and Yugoslav officials
firmly committed themselves to cooperation, and on June 28 Slobodan Milosevic
was transferred to the custody of the tribunal.The United States participated at the
conference and pledged U.S.$182 million, the largest individual state pledge.
KOSOVO
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
In the third year of Kosovo’s international administration the human rights situation
in the province continued to be of serious concern. Violence and hostility
rendered normal life impossible for Serbs, Roma, and other minorities. Participation
of minorities in the November 2001 elections for the Kosovo Assembly gave,
however, some hope for the prospects of ethnic coexistence in the province. The
U.N. administration came under growing local and international criticism for
attempting to improve the security situation by curtailing fundamental rights.And
despite the efforts of the United Nations, the administration of justice continued to
suffer from judicial bias, inadequate enforcement of human rights norms, and poor
investigations of serious crimes.
Ibrahim Rugova’s Democratic League of Kosovo (Lidhja Demokratike e
Kosovës, LDK) overwhelmingly won the October 2000 municipal elections with 58
per cent of the overall vote and a majority in twenty-four out of thirty municipal
assemblies. The main parties led by former KLA commanders, the Democratic
Party of Kosovo (PDK), and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK), fared less
well, receiving 27.3 and 7.7 percent of the vote, respectively.Members of the more
moderate LDK suffered numerous violent attacks in the months preceding the
election.Moreover, the elections were marred by the collective refusal of the Kosovo
Serb community to register and vote.While the United Nations Interim Administration
Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) pointed to the Belgrade authorities’ influence
over the Serb community’s decision, the preelection environment was rife with
incidents of violence and intimidation against members of the minority groups.
After the elections, the special representative of the U.N. secretary-general (SRSG), who exercises ultimate legislative and executive power in Kosovo, appointed
municipal assemblies in three localities with a majority Serb population. Representatives
of Kosovo’s Ashkalija,Bosniac, Egyptian, and Roma minority communities
generally accepted appointments to the new local government bodies.
In May 2001,UNMIK promulgated a Constitutional Framework for Provisional
Self-Government in Kosovo.The framework contained guarantees for the rights of
the minority communities and their members, including proportional or equal
representation in parliamentary committees, and safeguards against simple outvoting
by the majority on matters related to the minorities’ “vital interests.”
UNMIK retained exclusive authority in the sensitive areas of the judiciary, law
enforcement, and external relations. The framework incorporated into the document
a number of international human rights treaties that are directly applicable
in Kosovo. Its human rights chapter suffered, however, from two serious omissions:
the failure to incorporate the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights and the lack of any judicial review mechanisms through which individuals
and groups would enforce their constitutional rights. A special
constitutional chamber was established within the Supreme Court, but only governmental
actors were given standing to file motions with the chamber.
Whatever promise the new Constitutional Framework held for the future of the
Kosovo’s minorities, their members—the Serbs and Roma in particular—continued
to face severe threats to their personal safety, freedom of movement, and socioeconomic
well-being. The year 2001 saw some of the worst cases since the end of
the NATO campaign of organized violence targeting minorities, who make up a
disproportionate 20 percent of the victims of major crimes. In late January and
early February, Serb homes, churches, and cultural sites were damaged by mortar
fire and other similar attacks. Some of these sites had been designated for the
accommodation of potential returnees. On February 13, a convoy of Kosovo Serbs
en route to Strpce, escorted by peacekeepers of the multinational Kosovo Force
(KFOR), was the target of a shooting that left one person dead.Only three days later
a weekly convoy of civilian buses carrying about 250 Serbs to Gracanica, with a
KFOR escort of seven armored vehicles, fell victim to a brutal bomb attack killing
eleven people and injuring dozens. On April 18, the head of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia passport office in Prishtina, Aleksandar Petrovic, was killed in yet
another deadly bomb attack.
Attacks on minorities appeared to be increasingly focused and sophisticated.
Groups of Serbs and Roma returning from Serbia and other neighboring countries
were frequent victims of armed attacks. On November 9, 2000, three Ashkalija men
and a fifteen-year-old boy were shot dead, in execution style killings, a few days after
they had returned to Dosevac near Prishtina. Another group of Roma that had
recently gone back to Shtime was injured in a bomb attack on August 8. In August
2001 the first organized return of a group of fifty-four Serb refugees to Osojane was
followed by ethnic Albanian protests in nearby Istok.These and other incidents had
a devastating effect on the efforts of the international community to help refugees
and internally displaced persons return to their homes. The number of returnees
remained very small, and in some areas more minority residents were still leaving
Kosovo than returning.
Non-Albanians were not the only victims of organized violence. In November
2000, Xhemal Mustafa, a chief aide to Rugova and head of the Kosovo Information
Center, was assassinated in central Pristina. A pattern of politically motivated
killings which began in the spring of 2000 continued in 2001 with several attacks
against Kosovar Albanian political activists, generally LDK supporters. In April
2001, unidentified gunmen murdered Ismet Rraci,Mayor of Klina and chairman of
the local LDK branch. On September 1, the houses of two LDK officials from the
villages of Belobrod and Brodosavce were bombed.However, no other serious incidents
took place in the run-up to the November 17 general election, and the election
day itself was largely peaceful.
Twenty-six political parties and independent candidates, including representatives
of five minority groups, were certified by the OSCE to contest the November
election. These included a coalition of twenty Kosovo Serb parties and organizations,
named Coalition Return,which decided to register at the last minute. In contrast
with the 2000 municipal elections, Kosovo Serb and other minority voters
registered in large numbers: 70,000 within the province and an additional 100,000
in Serbia and Montenegro. And in spite of the drawn-out hesitation both in Belgrade
and among the Kosovo Serbs about their participation in the vote, about 46
percent of all eligible Kosovo Serb voters turned out to vote on November 17. In
northern Kosovo,where Serbian extremists were responsible for widespread intimidation
of voters into abstention, the participation of ethnic Serbs was considerably
lower than the average.
Trafficking of women into Kosovo for forced prostitution continued to surge in
2001: the International Organization for Migration reported that 160 trafficked
women and girls received repatriation assistance between February 2000 and May
2001. Implementation of a new UNMIK regulation providing for victim and witness
assistance came slowly, and only a handful of prosecutions went forward. The
United Nations disciplined four civilian police officers for alleged involvement in
trafficking. According to a report issued by the OSCE Legal Systems Monitoring
Section, women who brought charges for domestic violence, rape, or trafficking
faced bias, discrimination, and contempt from the judicial system, and the average
sentence for sexual violence cases declined from three years to one year.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
The Humanitarian Law Center (HLC) looked into allegations of unlawful
detention and monitored trials against Kosovo Serbs charged with war crimes and
other serious offences. In one case it protested to UNMIK when international
authorities at the Mitrovica prison denied an HLC attorney access to his clients and
conducted unlawful searches of his effects. The Council for the Defense of Human
Rights and Freedoms continued to monitor and report regularly on human rights
violations in the province. Although the council was still more sensitive to violations
of the rights of ethnic Albanians than those of non-Albanians, it condemned
attacks against minority members in stronger terms than in previous years. The
Ombudsperson Institution, which started work in November 2000, dealt mostly with complaints related to property rights, employment controversies,due process,
and personal security. The Ombudsperson,Marek Antoni Nowicki, issued a number
of public reports on human rights violations by the U.N. administration, and
requested the latter to remedy them. One report concluded that a 2000 regulation
on privileges and immunities granted to KFOR and UNMIK violated the property
and due process rights of Kosovar individuals; another report looked into the lawfulness
of cases of executive detention ordered by the SRSG and found them in violation
of the defendants’ rights to a fair trial.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
In response to the unsatisfactory performance of the justice and law enforcement
systems, UNMIK created a new justice and police component and adopted
legislation to combat organized crime, weapons trafficking, and terrorism. But
these measures did not result in any significant improvement in the overall security
situation. Most major incidents of ethnic and political violence remained unresolved,
while the SRSG ordered the prolonged detention of certain suspects. Following
widespread criticism of its practices of administrative detention, in
September UNMIK set up a commission of international legal experts to make final
decisions on the legality of administrative detentions. A new UNMIK regulation
authorized potential victims of ethnic bias in the criminal justice system to request
that their case be tried by a panel with a majority of international judges.The number
of international judges and prosecutors, however, fell short of what was needed
to implement the regulation. UNMIK’s failure to adequately consult and involve
local and international organizations in drafting legislation also caused frustration.
Acting pursuant to an indictment charging Slobodan Milosevic and four other
Yugoslav and Serbian officials with crimes against humanity and violations of the
laws and customs of war committed in Kosovo, the Serbian authorities handed
Milosevic over to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia on
June 28, 2001. The tribunal was also investigating allegations of crimes committed
by the KLA during the 1998-1999 conflict in Kosovo; however, it had issued no public
indictments at the time of writing. The U.N.’s special rapporteur on human
rights in the former Yugoslavia at the time, Jiri Dienstbier, reported in January and
March 2001 on the human rights situation in Kosovo. The U.N. Commission on
Human Rights appointed José Cutileiro as its special representative with a one-year
mandate to monitor the human rights situation in certain parts of the former
Yugoslavia, including Kosovo.
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
The OSCE Mission in Kosovo (OMIK) continued to monitor and report on the
situation of Kosovo’s minorities and the human rights performance of the justice
system. A February OSCE report highlighted the persistence of bias in criminal proceedings, the absence of habeas corpus procedures, and the lack of effective
access to defense counsel. The OSCE was particularly critical of several convictions
of Kosovo Serbs and Roma charged with war crimes and genocide, which its monitors
found inconsistent with the evidence presented in the courtroom. In one of
the genocide cases, the OSCE called for review of the sentence by a panel of international
judges. The organization of the November elections in line with international
standards was a major challenge for the OSCE, which cooperated with the
International Organization for Migration to open registration centers for Kosovo
refugees in neighboring countries.
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
The 40,000-strong NATO-led KFOR made greater efforts in 2001 to cooperate
with the U.N. civilian police in confronting organized violence and crime. In a
number of cases, however, it refused to share information with U.N. officials investigating
serious crimes in which members of the Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC)
were thought to be implicated. In an attempt to address a major public relations
problem, KFOR offered to review Kosovar claims relating to land and properties
damaged or taken by its troops without compensation. Between November 2000
and June 2001 the ombudsperson received sixty-two compensation claims against
KFOR, despite making it clear that he lacked jurisdiction over the multinational
force.
European Union
In January 2001 the European Union called on the Belgrade authorities to
release Kosovo Albanian political prisoners detained in Serbia. E.U. officials condemned
the violent attacks against Kosovo’s minorities and threatened to withdraw
promised economic aid if violence did not stop. The European Union nevertheless
continued to be Kosovo’s main donor,with 362.5 million euros pledged in 2001 for
reconstruction assistance and humanitarian aid.
United States
The incoming U.S. administration avoided a blow to the stability of Kosovo and
the Balkans by declaring that the United States had no intention of withdrawing
troops unilaterally from the region. In July President Bush blacklisted five senior
KPC officers for their support of the ethnic Albanian armed insurgency in Macedonia.
The five were promptly discharged by the head of UNMIK. U.S. officials
came under criticism, however, for their alleged failure to support criminal investigations
involving top KPC officials, and in some cases for attempting to unduly
influence the investigations.
