VENEZUELA
Venezuela experienced extreme political turmoil in early 2002, which culminated
in a failed attempt to oust President Hugo Chávez in April. After
the attempted coup, Venezuelan society remained deeply polarized, political
protests continued, and economic conditions worsened, leaving the country at risk
of further violent conflict and jeopardizing democracy and the rule of law. The
human rights situation was also marked by problems in the administration of justice,
police abuses, and threats to freedom of expression.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Opposition to the Chávez government began to mount at the end of 2001, following
the passage, by presidential decree, of forty-nine economic laws, including
legislation covering land reform and tightening the government’s control over the
oil industry. On December 10, 2001, Venezuela’s leading business association,
Fedecámaras, led a one-day general strike to protest the new laws. Thousands of
businesses across Venezuela, as well as the country’s largest labor union confederation,
the Confederation ofVenezuelan Workers (Confederación de Trabajadores de
Venezuela, CTV), participated in the strike. Members of the armed forces also
began to take an overtly critical position; in February 2002, several high-ranking
military officers called for Chávez’s resignation.
On April 9, following labor disputes at Venezuela’s national oil company, CTV
and Fedecámaras called another general strike. Tensions increased when, on April
11, labor groups, business organizations, the political opposition, and members of
civil society participated in a massive protest march to support the strike and to
demand Chávez’s resignation. Marksmen in civilian clothes in nearby buildings
opened fire as some five hundred thousand people marched to the presidential palace in downtown Caracas, where Chávez’s supporters had gathered to oppose
the march. Eighteen civilians died and more than 150 others were injured during
the protest. Victims included both government supporters and members of the
opposition, as well as a press photographer covering the event.
In the immediate wake of the violence, a group of senior military officers forced
President Chávez from office. Pedro Carmona Estanga, head of Fedecámaras, acted
briefly as the country’s self-declared president. This rupture of the constitutional
order gave way to a broader attack on the rule of law as Carmona dissolved the legislature,
the Supreme Court, and the country’s new constitution, which had been
approved under Chávez in 1999 by a constituent assembly and a popular referendum
vote. In addition, authorities conducted illegal searches and detentions of
Chávez supporters during the days following the coup.
Street protests by Chávez supporters continued after he was removed from
office, and rioting and looting occurred in the poor,western areas of Caracas. Some
forty to sixty people were killed during this second eruption of violence.Most were
believed to have been killed by security forces, including by the Metropolitan
Police. Rapidly, military units also began to rise up in support of Chávez. Under
mounting popular and military pressure, the short-lived Carmona government
folded, and Chávez returned to power on April 14.
Although democratic institutions were restored, democracy remained at risk.
Amid growing polarization in the military, further street protests, and the threat of
more strikes, dialogue between the government and the opposition broke down,
while Chávez continued to publicly disparage the opposition and the largely antigovernment
media. Sectors of the opposition continued to seek both constitutional
and extra-constitutional means to oust him from office.
Street violence broke out again on August 14 when the Supreme Court, previously
considered to be loyal to Chávez, voted by eleven votes to eight to dismiss
charges against four senior military officers accused of plotting his overthrow in
April. Chávez responded to the verdict by announcing that the judges responsible
for the vote would be investigated for drunkenness and falsifying documents, and
said he was considering reforms to the constitution.Meanwhile, opposition leaders
advocated a referendum and the filing of criminal charges against the president.
In September, in an effort to block demonstrations, the government restricted
freedom of movement in the areas surrounding six key military installations, a state
radio, and a state television center, designating them as “security zones.” The constitutionality
of the move, based on a little-used 1976 law, was questioned by the
opposition and human rights groups.
Anti-Chávez strikes and marches continued.On October 22, a group of fourteen
military officers, including some generals and admirals, declared that they were in
“legitimate disobedience” of the Chávez government and called on other members
of the armed forces to join them. The generals said that they considered the square
where they read out the declaration—the Plaza Francia, in Caracas’s upscale
Altamira district—to be “liberated territory.” The opposition used the square for
further protest activities, and began to collect signatures for a referendum to force
Chávez’s resignation.Meanwhile,more generals joined the group. On November 4,
scores of people were injured, including an Ecuadorian cameraman who was shot but saved by his flak-jacket, when pro-government demonstrators tried to prevent
government opponents from presenting a list of referendum signatures to the
National Electoral Council.
Human rights conditions suffered in this highly polarized environment.By early
November, only four people had been detained in connection with the April shootings.
Video footage taken during the protest march suggested that two members of
the Metropolitan Police (under the command of an anti-Chávez mayor),one member
of the National Guard, and at least eleven civilians fired their weapons.Most of
the civilians were said to work for, or to have worked for, the Chávez government.
Efforts by the legislature to establish a truth commission to determine responsibility
for the April deaths stalled when government and opposition legislators were
unable to agree on its composition and authority. A draft truth commission law
proposed in May by a group of nine human rights nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs) was weakened during initial deliberations in the legislature.Membership
criteria were relaxed, and the powers of the proposed commission were reduced,
casting serious doubts on its future credibility, independence, and effectiveness. By
early November, the law had still not been approved.
This failure to make progress in investigating the April violence was symptomatic
of endemic problems within the Venezuelan justice system as a whole. The
attorney general’s office and the judiciary—under-funded and inefficient—proved
incapable of dispensing justice efficiently and impartially.
“Social cleansing”-type killings by police forces continued to be a grave problem,
especially in the provinces. In the state of Portuguesa, a self-styled “extermination
group” composed of off-duty members of the state police and National Guard was
responsible for killing alleged street criminals and drug-users. In a study released in
October 2001, the Human Rights Ombudsman, a state body charged with the promotion
and defense of human rights, reported that a second extermination group
had appeared in the state, and that these groups were believed to have committed
105 killings in Portuguesa in 2000-2001. They were reportedly financed in part by
local storekeepers. Similar extermination groups were reported to be active in the
states of Falcón,Yaracuy,Anzoátegui, Bolívar,Miranda,Aragua, and Zulia.
At this writing, fourteen policeman were in detention in Barquisimeto, state of
Lara, facing charges for killings in Portuguesa. In most cases the judiciary either
failed to detain and charge those responsible for killings attributed to the police, or
trials were subject to excessive delays.Victims’ family members and lawyers suffered
death threats.Miguel Ángel Zambrano, a former inspector of the Portuguesa police
who had carried out investigations into the activities of the death squads, kept
receiving anonymous death threats by telephone, and was beaten and threatened by
police officers who confronted him in person.Unidentified individuals he believed
to be linked to the police shot at him twice, leading him to go into hiding. In Falcón,
the state police commander lodged criminal complaints against people who
denounced killings for “insulting the police.”
Prison conditions in Venezuela remained inhumane. Levels of inmate violence
were extremely high, abetted by insufficient staffing and equipment, widespread
corruption among guards, and the unchecked entry into prisons of narcotics and
firearms. Five prisoners died and some twenty were injured during a May prison riot in El Rodeo prison in Guatire. According to interior and justice ministry figures,
there were eighty-four shooting deaths and forty-two stabbing deaths in
Venezuelan prisons between January and May.
Although Venezuela’s record on freedom of expression attracted a great deal of
international criticism, there were some positive aspects: There was no censorship
of print media prior to publication, journalists were not imprisoned, and the press
was free to say what it wished. Indeed,much of the media clearly sympathized with
the opposition, advocated opposition positions, and used bold language in criticizing
the government.
Nonetheless, on occasion the government openly interfered with private television
programming by forcing private media stations to transmit government-supplied
broadcasts.This interference was particularly pronounced during the week of
the failed coup, when the Chávez government repeatedly interrupted scheduled
programming to air its views on the political situation. On April 11, the Chávez
government temporarily halted the transmission of the main private television stations
altogether.
State interference with private programming diminished dramatically following
the events of April. However, as before, President Chávez launched regular tirades
against members of the news media during his weekly Aló Presidente radio program,
using strong and offensive language. Given the polarized political situation,
Chávez’s aggressive attacks on his press critics risked being interpreted by his supporters
as an incitement to violence.
Indeed, local journalists did receive serious threats and, in some instances, were
subject to violent physical attacks.At least twenty-five journalists sought protective
measures from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. On February
21, Chávez supporters disrupted an anti-Chávez protest at the University of
Venezuela (Universidad de Venezuela), reportedly attacking members of the press
with sticks and stones, and injuring a journalist and a cameraman. Lina Ron, a
prominent Chávez supporter who participated in the incident, was arrested and
briefly jailed for her alleged involvement in the riot.
In addition, an unidentified assailant threw an explosive device at the offices of
the Caracas newspaper Así Es La Noticia on January 31. Another unidentified
attacker threw a grenade at the Caracas offices of the television station Globovisión
on July 9. In the early morning of September 13, the station of Promar TV in Barquisimeto,
was hit by fire bombs. Previously the station director had received death
threats.Although no one was injured in these attacks, they caused material damage
and intimidated employees. No arrests were made in connection with these incidents.
The Chávez government continued to undermine the independence of labor
unions. New union elections held under the supervision of the National Electoral
Council (CNE), a state body, occurred in the fall of 2001. On October 25, 2001,
Venezuela’s largest trade union federation, CTV, participated in the state-supervised
election process and elected Carlos Ortega as its president.However, the CNE
refused to approve the results of the election, claiming that there had been irregularities.
Although the Supreme Court urged the CNE to make a final decision as to
the election’s legitimacy, by November it had not done so.
Applications for asylum by Colombians more than doubled in the first eight
months of 2002, probably because of the breakdown of peace negotiations in
neighboring Colombia in February.Most Colombian asylum seekers lived in complete
economic insecurity and legal limbo. In October 2001, a new Organic Law on
Refugees and Asylum Seekers entered into force, prohibiting the forcible return of
asylum seekers until their applications had been decided, and establishing a
National Commission for Refugees to consider asylum applications. By the end of
October, however, legislation regulating the composition and powers of the commission
had still not been approved, meaning that there was no body to process
applications. In September,William Spindler, a spokesperson of the regional office
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said that more than a
thousand refugees from Colombia were awaiting a decision, of whom about half
had filed their applications in 2002. They included human rights lawyers and trade
unionists who had received death threats from both paramilitaries and guerrillas.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Human rights defenders came under increasing pressure in 2002. In April and
May, Liliana Ortega, executive director of the Committee of Relatives of Victims of
the Events of February-March 1989 (Comité de Familiares de Víctimas de los Sucesos
de Febrero-Marzo de 1989, COFAVIC), a respected nongovernmental human
rights group, received threats via telephone and electronic mail. The Venezuelan
authorities provided her and COFAVIC with police protection, and the attorney
general opened an investigation into the threats.However,COFAVIC reported that
little progress was made in this investigation.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
On April 15, in the immediate wake of the failed coup, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan called President Chávez to express satisfaction that the restoration of
constitutional order in Venezuela was underway. He appealed for national reconciliation
and stressed the importance of maintaining an inclusive democratic system.
As coup rumors intensified again in early October, the secretary-general issued
a statement urging patience and moderation, and supporting international efforts
to promote dialogue.
Venezuela was expected to defend its record in implementing the rights codified
in the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment
or Punishment before the Committee against Torture in May. However, due
to the failed coup attempt, the committee granted Venezuela an extension until
November. In previous reviews of Venezuela’s record of compliance, the committee
expressed grave concern with the high number of cases of torture and abuse in
the country, as well as with the state’s failure to bring those responsible to justice.
Organization of American States
The Organization of American States (OAS) applied the newly-created Inter-
American Democratic Charter for the first time during the April political crisis in
Venezuela. Approved by the Permanent Council of the OAS and subsequently ratified
by the foreign ministers of OAS member states in September 2001, the charter
was designed to protect democracy in the region. It codifies the OAS’s power to suspend
member states deemed undemocratic and sets up mechanisms for responding
to coups and other threats to democracy.
As prescribed in the charter, the Permanent Council convoked an emergency
meeting regarding the coup on April 13, following a request by Latin American foreign
ministers. The Permanent Council issued a resolution condemning the alteration
of constitutional order and stating that the alteration justified an application
of the charter. The Permanent Council further resolved to send a mission headed
by the OAS secretary general to Venezuela immediately to promote democratic
normalization.At an emergency meeting of the General Assembly on April 18, the
secretary general presented the findings of this mission, noting concern for the
excessive polarization in Venezuelan society and the dangerous practice of political
advocacy within the armed forces.
The OAS sent two additional fact-finding missions to Venezuela in 2002. First,
the executive secretary of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights
(IACHR) of the OAS traveled to Venezuela in February to investigate the status of
freedom of expression in the country.He expressed concern regarding the violence
that had occurred against members of the media and noted that statements by
high-ranking public officials against the media could lead to acts of intimidation or
self-censorship. Second, the president of the IACHR led a mission in May to evaluate
the human rights situation in Venezuela. Among other things, the president
underscored the need for an in-depth, impartial, and objective investigation into
the crimes committed in April.
Continuing to monitor democracy in Venezuela, the General Assembly of the
OAS adopted a resolution on June 4, pledging to provide Venezuela with support to
consolidate the democratic process and urging the Venezuelan government to
accept OAS assistance in promoting national dialogue in its reconciliation process.
In September, the OAS, the United Nations Development Program, and the Carter
Center formed a tripartite group aimed at facilitating dialogue. Following a fiveday
visit to Venezuela, the group drafted a Declaration of Principles for Peace and
Democracy, committing government and opposition to reject violence and seek
peaceful agreement. By the end of October, the government and some opposition
parties, excluding the two largest, had signed the declaration.
In August, the Inter-American Court ofHuman Rights ordered Venezuela to pay
compensation amounting to U.S.$1,559,800 to the relatives of thirty-seven people
killed by security forces during a February 27, 1989 popular revolt, known as the
Caracazo.
European Union
In May, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the second Summit of
Heads of State and Government of Latin America, the Caribbean and the European
Union, expressing “concern over the events that took place in Venezuela in connection
with the attempted coup d’état against President Chávez.” On October 8, the
European Union issued a statement backing the mediating efforts of the tripartite
group and the OAS secretary general.
United States
In contrast to the reaction of Latin American governments, the United States
failed to immediately condemn the April coup as an interruption in the constitutional
order. Rather, on April 12, in an initial State Department statement, the U.S.
blamed the Chávez government itself for precipitating the coup, stating that “undemocratic
actions committed or encouraged by the Chávez administration provoked”
the crisis. But the next day, as the illegal actions of the de facto government
continued, the U.S. voted in favor of the OAS resolution condemning the coup
attempt. In September, amid further coup rumors, the U.S. embassy in Venezuela
issued a declaration unequivocally stating its opposition to any illegal disruption of
constitutional rule in Venezuela.
The United States also supported OAS efforts to mediate the political crisis in
Venezuela. On June 3, at an OAS General Assembly meeting in Barbados,U.S. Secretary
of State Colin Powell said that Venezuela should avail itself of OAS mechanisms
to strengthen democracy.
