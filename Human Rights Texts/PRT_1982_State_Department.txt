 PORTUGAL
 The revision of the 1976 Constitution, approved by the Assembly
 of the Republic in August 1982, completed Portugal's transition
 from the authoritarian regime overthrown in 1974 to a
 full-fledged, multi-party parliamentary democracy.
 Constitutional revisions which went into effect on October 30,
 1982, removed the remaining independent military role in
 government. The Portuguese Government is chosen by a popularly
 eected Parliament. The President also is chosen by direct
 popular vote.
 Human rights improved dramatically in the wake of the April 25,
 1974 revolution which ended a 48-year dictatorship, abolished
 censorship, and dismantled the secret police structure.
 Portuguese were quick to exercise their rights of free speech;
 exiled political leaders returned; political parties based on
 general Western European prototypes appeared.
 The 1982 revision of the Constitution eliminates much of the
 ideological rhetoric of the 1975 Constitution, consolidates the
 guarantees of civil liberties contained in its predecessor, and
 allows for a liberalization of the economy. The Government has
 promised an economic reform program that will reduce the role
 of the state and move the Portuguese economy to one even more
 closely resembling the free-market economies of other
 democracies.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There are no officially sanctioned political killings in
 Portugal. However, two politically related deaths marred
 1982. During the evening of April 30 to May 1, two young men
 were killed in Oporto when police intervened to keep members of
 the Communist-dominated General Confederation of Portuguese
 Workers from attacking members of the rival democratic General
 Union of Workers organization. According to press reports, the
 victims were shot during the early morning hours while fleeing
 street battles between the police and large numbers of General
 Confederation of Portuguese Workers agitators.
 b. Disappearance
 Persons are not abducted, secretly arrested, or held in
 clandestine detention by police or security forces.
 c. Torture
 Portugal has been free from torture since the dismantling of
 the secret police in 1974. Torture is constitutionally
 forbidden, and evidence gained by such means cannot be used in
 criminal proceedings.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There has been no credible evidence of cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment or punishment since November 1975. Such
 treatment or punishment is forbidden by the Constitution.
 Portugal's maximum penalty is 28 years imprisonment.

 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Since November 1975, there have been a few cases in which
 Portuguese citizens were held without specific charges longer
 than the 48-hour period allowed by the Constitution. In those
 cases, defense lawyers were able to obtain due process for
 their clients through legal efforts and publicity. The right
 to habeas corpus is guaranteed by the Constitution.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Portugal allows no secret trials or condemnations and the
 judicial system is fair. A large backlog of cases in the
 overburdened court sytem has, however, caused delays. Some
 individuals are held in prison for long periods before their
 cases come to trial. Bail is unusual for those accused of
 serious crimes. Four suspected terrorists, members of a
 far-left political party, drew widespread public attention when
 they carried out a hunger strike to protest their continuing
 confinement without trial. (A previous conviction of two
 members had been overturned during the previous summer.) The
 hunger strikers, three of whom are now free, ended their fast
 after the Government promised to introduce legislation limiting
 detention without trial.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The inviolability of the home is guaranteed. The Constitution
 requires an 'order of the competent judicial authority* for
 searches of and entries into homes and specifies that the
 consent of the occupants must be obtained to enter.a home at
 night. The provisions are respected, and any irregularities
 would be subject to immediate scrutiny through the press and
 official institutions.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of.Speech and Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed under the Constitution and
 respected in practice, although two provisions of law limit the
 range of permissible political activity.
 The Assembly of the Republic passed the so-called "Anti-Fascist
 Law" in June 1978, prohibiting fascist organizations,i
 discussions of corporatism, and other activities related to
 *fascism.w The law provides penalties of from two to eight
 years imprisonment for violations. Because of its vagueness
 and applicability to only one side of the political spectrum,
 the law has been questioned by some Portuguese human rights
 advocates. There have been-no prosecutions under the law.
 Persons associated with the old regime are not harassed and are
 politically active.
 Portugal's penal code also has a provision authorizing up to
 eight years imprisonment for those found guilty of *insulting'
 civil or military bodies, the President of the Republic, or
 members of the Revolutionary Council. (The Revolutionary
 Council disappeared with the entry into force of the
 Constitutional revision on October 29, 1982.) A few
 journalists have been prosecuted under this statute, most
 recently in June 1982, when the editor of a highly conservative
 journal was sentenced to twelve months (reduced to nine) in
 prison, fined approximately $400, and ordered to pay an
 indemnity of $555 for a verbal attack on a member of the
 Council of Revolution. The case is currently under appeal.

 The Portuguese Government is the owner of most of the nation's
 major daily journals, which were indirectly nationalized when
 Portugal's banks, to which they became heavily indebted, were
 nationalized after the Revolution. The Government does not
 control editorial content, and the daily journals reflect
 opinion across the political spectrum. Indirect government
 ownership has probably guaranteed the survival of smaller
 journals which are not financially self-sufficient.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right to peaceful assembly is guaranteed under Portuguese
 law and fully exercised in practice. Workers have the
 constitutional right to set up trade unions and trade union
 associations. Currently approximately 45 percent of the
 workforce is unionized. A law prohibiting the establishment of
 more than one national labor confederation (giving a monopoly
 to the Communist-dominated General Confederation of Portuguese
 Workers) was revoked in 1976. The General Union of Workers was
 established shortly thereafter as an alternative. The right to
 strike is protected by the Constitution and observed in
 practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The right to practice the religion of preference is
 constitutionally guaranteed and freely exercised throughout
 Portugal. There are no restrictions on the conduct of
 religious services of any denomination.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement, foreign travel, and emigration are
 guaranteed by the Constitution. The Constitution also mandates
 the acceptance of refugees, which Portugal has frequently done
 in the past. The Government of Portugal provides for the
 repatriation of its citizens from foreign countries when
 necessary and grants asylum to political refugees. Domestic
 travel is not circumscribed. However, currency exchange
 restrictions imposed because of balance of payments problems
 are a minor practical constraint on foreign travel by
 Portuguese citizens.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Portugal enjoys a democratic, multi-party system in which
 opposition parties operate freely with access to the media.
 Only 'fascist* organizations are outlawed. The Government has
 respected the Constitutional provision for universal, secret,
 and equal suffrage for all citizens over 18 years of age.
 The April 1978 revision of the civil code guarantees full legal
 equality for women in accord with the Constitution. Portugal
 was one of the first signatories of the UNConvention on the
 Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women.
 Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo served as Prime Minister for five
 months in 1979. Four women currently serve as State
 Secretaries (sub-cabinet level positions) in the national
 Government. Women play an active role in the political
 parties, but still remain under-represented in party and
 government leadership positions. This situation has shown
 considerable improvement since the 1974 revolution.

 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Portugal has cooperated with independent outside investigations
 of human rights conditions, and has brought the issue of
 displaced persons of East Timor to the UN. Portugal is a
 signer of the Helsinki Accords and is active in the Council of
 Europe's human rights monitoring. Private international human
 rights groups, such as Amnesty International, are also active
 in Portugal. The 1982 Freedom House report considers Portugal
 as 'free".
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Portugal, with a per capita gross national product of about
 $2,350, is Western Europe's poorest country. It is also
 Western Europe's least developed nation. The adult illiteracy
 rate is approximately 30 percent. Infant mortality (1980) is
 35 per 1000. Little more than a third (34.5 percent) of the
 population has access to safe water. Life expectancy (1980) is
 70.8 years. Portugal has integrated almost three-quarters of a
 million returnees from its former colonies since 1975.
 Approximately one-tenth of the 10,045,000 population (in 1981)
 lived and worked outside of Portugal.
 The Government has attempted to improve educational
 opportunities through a large-scale school-construction
 program. Education is free, and primary school education is
 now available throughout the country. In 1977 the primary
 school enrollment ratio (students enrolled in primary education
 as percentage of population in appropriate age group) was 117.
 A growing network of regional colleges is currently extending
 higher education beyond the traditional centers of Coimbra,
 Lisbon, and Oporto.
 Economic difficulties have touched all levels of Portuguese
 society. Agricultural dislocations following the 1974
 Revolution, exacerbated by two years of drought, led to drops
 in agricultural production. Portugal currently imports
 approximately one-half of its food needs. Yet partly due to
 government subsidies of consumer food prices, Portugal has been
 able to maintain an adequate nutritional standard for its
 population. The caloric supply available to nutritional
 requirements was 126 percent in 1977. In the non-agricultural
 sectors of Portugal's economy, unemployment and underemployment
 remain problems, especially for youth. Although
 constitutionally guaranteed equal rights, women have some
 disadvantages in seeking employment, partially because of
 mandatory, costly maternity benefits.
 Food, shelter, health care, and education are available to all
 inhabitants of Portugal, regardless of race, religion, sex,
 ethnic background, or political opinion.
