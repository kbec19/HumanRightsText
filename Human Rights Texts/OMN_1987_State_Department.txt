 OMAN
 The Sultanate of Oman is an absolute monarchy without
 popularly  lectqd representative institutions., The reigning
 Sultan, Qaboos bin SaidAl Said,'is the l4th ruler of the
 current dynasty. The State Consultative Council, formed in
 1981, functions as an advisory body on economic and social
 questions. Members are appointed by the Sultan who has
 continued the House of Al Said's long tradition of firm
 control over all questions affecting the Omani State.
 National security remains a matter-of continuing close
 attention. In the early years oftthe rule of Sultan Qaboos,
 the qoverx ment focused its concern on quelling an insurrection
 in the southern province of Dhofar, supported by the People's
 Democratic-4epub,] ic of Yemen (IPDRY). The insurrection was
 ddfeated in 19.75,-but in the face of- threats from the PDRY and
 later fror-Iran, Organ-continued -to devote considerable revenue
 to defense.- Oqman'p strategic 1,ocation 'on the south 'shore of
 the Strait of Hormuz exposes the cpuntry to the increased
 tension in-. the Persi.  Gfl. area. Many key jobs in the
 Government, psppg-AllyJiwr the military and internal security
 services, are-occupiedby outsiders, Indluding many British,
 although khe ntimber f, e~patriates is declining.'
 Almost,,ttally unleveigped -in 1970, Oman has used its-modest
 oil revenues to foster a remarkable degree of progress in the
 social, economic, and administrative spheres, achieving a
 significapt, impxc.rvement in -he living standards of its -people.
 Sultan Qaboos has also built onaaneaxldier trend to bring
 notables of the tribal system of the interior into the
 national admnistrativej system.
 Therq were no;,major devalopients in 1987 with significant
 impact- on khe huiman  rights. environment in-,Oman. While civil
 and politickl xights,.are ot dormally codified, the Government
 is reasonably access:ibleto,.the people through their tribal:,-
 leaders, and yalis (goverpors).- The internal security'zervices
 are  hrag-,-_,efficie q, ,and pprya8iye, but are 'not generally.-
 regarded as repressive, and the integrity of the individual is
 generally respected.,, ï¿½ - - -
 RiSPZCT.JXOR_ HUMAN RIGHTS--
 Section I Respect'1for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 . Freedom from:
 a. -Political Killing
 There were no- nown political killings in Oman in 1987..,
 b. Disappearance
 No cases of'disappearance were reported in 1987.
 _p,.,-To'rture and, Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 , Treatment or Punishment
 ThoughJslamic law is. administered throughout the country by
 Islamic judges, the amputations prescribed by such law are
 generally commuted by-the Government to prison terms., Prison
 condItions pre considered severe by Western standards; cells
 are not air-conditioned despite summer temperatures which can
 reach over 115 degrees.Fahrenheit, and all prisoners must
 observe the fasting requirements during the Islamic month of
 
 
 1265
 OMAN
 Ramadan. There were no reports of torture or other forms of
 cruel punishment by Omani authorities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Although Omani law does not provide for habeas corpus or its
 equivalent, the period of detention before trial in criminal
 cases is usually short. Police notification may be slow, but
 incommunicado detention is not practiced. Under current Omani
 practice, a person suspected of a crime may be held up to 15
 days while a case is under investigation, although this may be
 extended to a maximum of 70 days if approved by the magistrate.
 Attorneys are not always permitted access to their clients.
 While abuses of the police power of arrest have occurred, the
 criminal code imposes penalties for unjustified arrest or
 detention. Citizens have several channels through which they
 can seek redress of any grievance against law enforcement
 authorities, and these appear to function well, particularly
 in rural areas.
 Membership in certain unauthorized organizations is a criminal
 offense. The Dhofar insurgency (1965-1975) led to the
 imprisonment of members of the Popular Front for the
 Liberation of Oman (PFLO). Although the PFLO remains a
 proscribed organization and a few of its members remain in
 custody, many former insurgents benefited from an amnesty and
 returned to Oman from the bordering areas of the PDRY. All
 Omanis who were in exile under the previous Sultan were given
 the opportunity to return, as many thousands did after 1970.
 The grace period for those in self-imposed exile who wished to
 return to Oman'ended on December 31, 1986.
 Theie is no forced labor in Oman.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Islamic law prescribes a fair and speedy trial before
 experienced and impartial judges, and judicial practice, in
 Oman conforms' largely to these prescriptions. In fact, the
 majority of cases are settled by out-of-court negotiations.
 There is'no right under law to a jury, counsel, or public
 trial, and attorneys are not provided for fhose who cannot
 afford them. If a case proceeds to trial, it is heard before
 a judge alone. Generally, all questioning is conducted by the
 judge, and there is no examination or cross-examination by the
 prosecution, accused, or attorney of the accused. Either side
 may request the judge to ask particular questions of a witness,
 however, and some judges do permit direct questioning of
 witnesses. At the discretion of the judge, the accused may
 call witnesses. Decisions are generally pronounced promptly,
 and sentencing is immediate. Verdicts are final, although
 there may be informal appeals to the State Advisor for Penal
 Affairs and ultimately to the Sultan in cases involving
 serious offenses. The Sultan must approve death penalty
 verdicts. The various judicial systems.are technically
 subordinate to the Sultan, but they operate independently in
 'the majority of cases.
 In January the Ministry of Interior announced the returp of
 the "Al Barzah" or people's courts which are described as one
 of Oman's most ancient and traditional institutions. According
 to the plan, the Al-Barzah sessions will be convened in the
 forts of the larger wilayats of the country. The wali
 (governor), assisted by his deputy, a judge, and staff will
 preside over the sessions. The Al Barzahs handle personal
 
 
 1266
 OMAN
 disputes as well as minor commercial disputes, but do not
 handle criminal cases. Those cases not settled by the
 people's courts are referred to Oman's existing formal courts
 of law.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence'
 Warrants are not required to search private residences,
 offices,'or vehicles. Such searches, however, as well as the
 monitoring 'of telephones and private correspondence, are
 confi ied to cases where the Govexnment perceives a security
 threat 'or criminal activity.
 There is no forced membership in political organizations.
 Although there is nb government policy to discourage the use
 of other llnguagds in speech or print or in religious
 instructibn iA the home, the Government has increasingly
 insisted that correspondence with it, and public and legal
 documents, be in Arabic. A 1986 law banned, with a few
 insignificant exceptions, marriage between Omanis and
 foreigners. The move was explained as an effort-to stem the
 erosion of Omani culture. Those already married to'foreigners
 had to register 4ithin a specified period or risk forfeiting
 their citizenship and that of their offspring.
 Sectibn'2 Respect for "ivil Liberties, Including:
 a. ,Freedom of Speech apd Press
 There'are 'no pio4isions in.'law which protect freedom of speech
 or freedom of the press." Criticism of the Sultan in any form
 or medium is prohibited by law. Criticism of individual
 officials, agencies, and their programs is tolerated but is
 not given media coverage. The Government controls, all radio
 and television broadcasting. Government control of all
 printed matter, includjng newspapers and magazines, is
 specified, in the Press'and Publicotion'law, issued in May
 1984. the'la'itfposes strict'controls o, and a mechanism
 for, prior censorship of all infbgartion in printed form in
 both domestic ahd impotted publications. The Government owns
 two of the three daily newspapers, one in Arabic and one in
 English. Subsidies to the several privately owned weekly and
 biweekly publications provide'an effective incentive to
 self-censorship, although there have been arrests and closure
 for offensive articles. Thus, editorials and news coverage
 invariably reflect the Government's views. Publications
 arriving in Oman from foreign countries are censored for
 politically or sexually offensive-material and are
 occasionally banned. The'censor's attention generally focuses
 on artiaies 'that directly attaqk or embarrass the Omani
 Governmeht. In 1986 the regional'correspondentof a respected
 economic journal was warned of the consequences of critical
 coverage of Oman, and one local English newspaper was shut
 down. In 1987 two expatriate reporters were deported for
 articles-written about Oman.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is not guaranteed by law. Associations of
 any kind must register-with the Government, and those which
 oppose the political system of the Sultanate are prohibited.
 Labor unions and strikes are illegal, and there is no.
 collective bargaining: Although Oman's labor law specifically
 prohibits the fight to'strike, it does mention the. conc'ept of
 
 
 1267
 OMAN
 "collective grievance" and encourages conciliation of disputes
 through the formation of joint consultative bodies of labor
 and management. The organization of other professional groups
 is embryonic.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Oman is an Islamic state, and virtually all Omani citizens
 adhere to one or another sect of Islam, the exception being
 the small Hindu community made up of Omani citizens of Indian
 origin. Ibadhi Muslims are in the overall majority and include
 the ruling family. However, members of the minority Sunni and
 Shi'a Muslim communities are found in all walks of life in both
 the public and private sector. Non-Muslim foreigners, both
 Christian and Hindu, are allowed to worship at designated
 locations on land donated by the Government. Although there
 is no indigenous Jewish community, Jews are not barred from-
 living and working in Oman. Religion is-not a factor in
 gaining entry into Oman. Non-Muslims in Oman are prohibited
 from proselytizing. Conversion to Islam is encouraged and
 publicized.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Omanis living abroad before 1970 have returned to Oman in
 large numbers with official encouragement'and without legal
 obstacles. Several thousand ethnic Omani refugees from East
 Africa, particularly Zanzibar, have been successfully
 resettled. Many Omanis who had sought refuge in the PDRY
 during the insurgency in Dhofar (1965-75) have returned to
 Oman with official encouragement. Non-Omani refugees are not
 permitted to remain in Oman. Those few that reach Oman are
 generally returned to their homelands unless they can be
 quickly resettled in a third country. Omanis may travel
 abroad freely, although a woman must have authorization from
 her husband or father to obtain a passport. Many Omanis work
 abroad, particularly in the United Arab Emirates, where an
 estimated 30,000 Omanis are currently employed. Many of these
 people travel home to Oman on weekends. With the exception of
 a few military areas, there are no restrictions on travel by
 Omanis within -their country. The Government's development of
 transportation has greatly increaseo the ability tor move
 within the country to heretofore inaccessible areas.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Sultanate of Oman has no formal democratic institutions.
 Consequently, most of its citizens do not have a say in the
 choice of leaders or in changing the political system. Oman
 is a monarchy in which the Sultan retains the final word in
 all government decisions. Succession to the monarchy is
 determined through a consensus of the ruling family and leading
 public figures. There are no political parties, legal
 opposition groups, elections, or constitution.. Citizens have
 access to senior officials through the traditional practice of
 submitting petitions for the redress of grievances.
 Successful redress depends on the effectiveness of personal
 contact and the quality of the persons chosen as
 intermediaries. Outside of Muscat, the Government still
 reflects the tribal nature of Omani society. Traditional
 elites dominate the tribal and town councils, which settle
 intratribal disputes. Final authority, however, is with the
 walis, who are appointed by the Sultan.
 
 
 1268
 OMAN
 In an effort to broaden participation in the Government, the
 Sultan.formed the State Consultative Council in 1981. It
 consists of 55 members drawn from the Government, the business
 community, and the outlying districts. It includes members of
 every significant ethnic, geographic, and religious group. At
 present, the Council's role is an advisory one, limited to the
 social and economic spheres.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government of Oman declined to receive a proposed Amnesty
 International mission in 1972 during the insurgency in Dhofar.
 Since-then, .there have been no known requests by international
 human rightsorganizations to visit Oman. There are no
 independent organizations in the country to monitor human
 rights violations. Though Oman usually plays a passive role
 in the, United Nations and other bodies on human rights issues,
 it has criticized Israel's practices in the territories under
 its occupation and the South African system of apartheid in
 U.N. forums.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Rice, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Though conservative, Oman has not been .extreme in the
 interpretation of Islamic precepts on the status of~women.
 Women have shared in the benefits of the social and economic
 growth of recent years, and schooling for girls is available
 to the same extent as for boys in urban areas, less so in
 rural areas. I owever, for cultural reasons, the level of
 education which girl& attain is still below that of boys.
 Many urban Omani women drive cars. A few women have reached
 high positions in the public sector. By and large, however,
 occupational advances available to women are limited'to the
 traditional spheres of teaching, qecretarial work, and nursing.
 The gains achieved by-a small minority of women are largely
 irrelevant to the great majority, both in the towns and in the
 rural areas,. who live their lives within- the confines-of the
 house and4the local marketplace. The previous lack of adult
 education facilities means that all but the youngest females
 in rural areas are illiterate. This general lack of education,
 combined with communal and tribal customs which dictate a
 subsidiary role for women, makes it difficult for mast adult
 women to participate fully in the modern sector. The
 expansion of educational facilities for girls (including the
 new university) will allow for some equalization of the
 position of women in the future, but communal and tribal
 customp will continue to mitigate against full participation
 by women for the foreseeable future.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Oman'.s labor law, issued in 1983, is a comprehensive document
 defining conditions of employment for both Omani and foreign
 workers, who constitute approximately 50 percent of the work
 force. The labor law reportedly is fairly enforced, and
 workers' grievances, which are handled within the Ministry of
 Labor and Social Affairs, are generally given the benefit of
 the doubt in hearings conducted by labor inspectors.
 Oman's labor law states that the Government can determine the
 minimum wage and make adjustments according to economic
 
 
 1269
 OMAN
 circumstances. In practice, the minimum wage in Oman has
 covered only unskilled Omani workers and is currently set at
 75 Omani riyals (approximately $195) per month. Unskilled
 foreign workers are not covered by these provisions, but in
 many cases the respective embassies set suggested minimum
 wages. Every worker has the right to annual leave of 15 days
 per year during the first 3 years of employment and 30 days
 per year thereafter.
 Employment of children under age 13 is prohibited. Omani law
 regulates the employment of juveniles, defined as those
 between the ages of 13 and 16, prohibiting evening and
 nighttime work, strenuous occupations, and overtime and
 holiday work. A special section deals with'employment
 conditions for woman, prohibiting evening and nighttime work,
 safeguarding health and morals, and setting out their rights*
 to maternity leave.
 Omani labor law is very specific on matters of occupational
 safety and access to medical treatment. Employees covered by
 the labor law can recover compensation for industrial injury
 or illness. The workweek is set at 48 hours (36 hours for
 Muslims during Ramadan).-
