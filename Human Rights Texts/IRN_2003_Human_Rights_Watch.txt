HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Human rights progress in Iran was caught in a continuing political power struggle
between popularly elected reformers, who controlled both the presidency and
Parliament, and clerical conservatives, who exercised authority through the office
of the Leader (held by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei), the Council of Guardians, the judiciary,
and the armed forces.Despite landslide electoral victories in every major election
from 1997 to 2002, the reformers were unable to dislodge repressive policies
favored by the clerical leadership, including far-reaching restrictions on freedom of
expression, association, and political participation.
The Council of Guardians repeatedly blocked bills passed by the Parliament in
such areas as women’s rights, family law, the prevention of torture, and electoral
reform.The judiciary, deployed as one of the conservative’s strongest weapons, further
undermined the rule of law with arbitrary closures of newspapers and imprisonment
of political activists.
Two notable political events illustrated the conflict between reformers and conservatives.
On July 8, a leading cleric, Ayatollah Jalaluddin Taheri, announced his
resignation as Friday Prayer Leader of Isfahan. Friday Prayer Leaders, appointed by
the Leader of the Islamic Republic, were the senior religious authorities in their cities and districts. In his widely circulated letter of resignation, the Ayatollah,
declaring that he would flee what he could no longer tolerate, issued a ringing
denunciation of the clerical establishment. He accused Iran’s clerical leaders of
directing and encouraging “a bunch of club wielders” and of “marrying the ill-tempered,
ugly hag of violence to religion.”He observed that the centers of power were
“unchecked and unbridled ...neither reproached by the executors of justice nor
reproved by the law.” This criticism of lack of accountability, corruption and lawlessness,
coming from someone of impeccable religious credentials at the heart of
the establishment, struck a deep chord. The conservative establishment sought to
limit the damage by ordering official news outlets to restrict their coverage of the
Ayatollah’s statement, an order that was only partially successful.
A second major political development revealed how structural contradictions
within the Islamic Republic perpetuated the political conflict between reformers
and conservatives. In September, President Khatami presented new bills to Parliament
designed to override obstacles to his reform agenda. One new bill sought to
increase the president’s power to issue warnings when state institutions exceeded
their constitutional functions.President Khatami had issued numerous such warnings
over the years to protest the arbitrary closures of newspapers or the jailing of
his supporters, but his warnings had been ignored. The bill was accompanied by
another designed to curb the powers of the Council of Guardians to veto electoral
candidates. By the end of the year, the bills had passed the Parliament easily, but
their endorsement by the Council of Guardians was unlikely.
Attacks against the independent news media persisted. They had begun in April
2000 with a speech by the Leader identifying the reformist press as “bases of the
enemy.” They continued in November 2001, when the daily Nation (Mellat) was
closed by order of the head of the Tehran Press Court, Judge Said Mortazavi. He
accused the newspaper of cultural bias and of ignoring warnings. The closure followed
a pattern, repeated throughout the year, in which the judiciary ignored the
press law requirement for a public court hearing in front of a jury before any order
to close.
On December 15, 2001,Mohammad Salamati, editor of Our Era (Asr-e Ma), the
mouthpiece of a group called Mojahedine of the Islamic Revolution Organization,
was sentenced to twenty-six months in jail for views he expressed in the journal.
The judge of the press court where he was tried ignored the jury’s recommendation
to commute the sentence. Salamati’s sentence was reduced to seventeen months on
appeal in March, and suspended after the intervention of the Ministry of Culture
and Islamic Guidance. The magazine remained closed at this writing. In December
2001 and January 2002, provincial newspapers in Tabriz, Hormuzgan, Luristan,
and Zanjan were closed and editors received prison terms of up to eighteen months
for inciting public opinion and insulting Islamic sanctities.Other closures in January
included specialist film magazines accused of offending moral decency. In
April, the Tabriz general court revoked the publication license of Shams-i Tabriz
weekly and sentenced publisher Ali Hamed Iman to seven months in jail and seventy-
four lashes.Charges against Iman included publishing lies, stoking ethnic tensions,
and insulting Islamic sanctities and officials.
A further wave of closures began in May. The judiciary banned the influential reformist newspaper Foundation (Bonyan). Then it closed the pro-reformist newspaper
Iran for twenty-four hours. The court gave no reason for the paper’s suspension,
but it was believed the decision was related to an allegedly blasphemous article
suggesting that the Prophet Muhammad enjoyed listening to women sing and play
music.
In July, the judiciary shut the leading reformist newspaper in Iran, New Day
(Norouz), for six months. The paper’s director, Mohssen Mirdamadi, a senior
reformist personality and a member of Parliament, was sentenced to six months in
jail, though he had not yet begun serving the sentence at this writing. Norouz was
the most important of the remaining reformist dailies and acted as the voice of the
biggest reform political faction, the Participation Front.Mirdamadi was also fined
and banned from press activities for four years. Another press court banned New
Day (Ruz-e Now) merely because its name was similar to Norouz.
The Tehran daily Mirror of the South (Ayineh-e Jonub), launched nationwide
only a week previously, was closed in July for allegedly publishing articles contrary
to the law and spreading propaganda against the Islamic revolution. A press court
subsequently banned the Daily Report (Guzarish-i Ruz),which had previously been
ordered closed temporarily. The judiciary also threatened to prosecute Iran’s official
Islamic Republic News Agency for printing a statement by the recently banned
opposition party, the Iran Freedom Movement (IFM). Further closures followed
and by the end of the year the number of newspaper and magazines closed since
April 2000 had reached over eighty-five titles. Any pretense that legal principles
would be observed in regulating the press disappeared. Iran’s press courts acted as
a law unto themselves, issuing closure orders by decree without legal basis.
Iran’s courts also restricted independent political activity through a series of
political trials of supporters of the National Religious Alliance (NRA), a loose
alliance of reform minded activists, who had been detained in March and April
2001. In November 2001, more than thirty members of the IFM, a fifty-year-old
political party,went on trial before the Tehran Revolutionary Court, accused of acts
against national security and planning to overthrow the government. They had
been among those detained in March and April 2001.
Six of the IFM detainees—Abolfazl Bazargan, Mohammad Tavasoli, Hashem
Sabaghian, Khosro Mansourian, Mohammad Naeimpour, and Alireza Hendi—
were held in detention until March 2002 and released while the trial was in session.
Many of the defendants were held incommunicado for months and coerced into
making incriminating statements. At trial, the prosecution presented no credible
evidence that the IFM defendants had engaged in anything other than legitimate,
peaceful political activity. In July, the court sentenced more than thirty defendants
to prison terms. Senior figures in the IFM received sentences of between eight and
ten years. The court also ordered the complete dissolution of the party. Ibrahim
Yazdi, the leader of the banned party, returned to Iran in April from medical treatment
in the United States.He, too, was facing criminal charges based on his political
activities, although his trial had not started at this writing.
In a related case, fifteen NRA activists were tried before the Tehran Revolutionary
Court in January on charges of seeking to overthrow the government. Ezzatollah
Sahhabi, arrested in December 2000, was held in an unknown location. The other fourteen, arrested in March 2001, were held incommunicado, most often in
solitary confinement, in a Tehran detention center known as Prison 59.Nine of the
detainees—Mohammad Maleki, Mohammad Hossein Rafiei, Alireza Rajaei, Reza
Alijani,MohammadBasteh Negar,Mahmoud Omrani,Massoud Pedram,Morteza
Kazemian, and MohammadMohammadi Ardehali—were released on bail in 2001.
The other five—Taghi Rahmani, Habibollah Payman, Reza Raeis-Toussi, Saeid
Madani, and Hoda Saber—remained in Prison 59 until March 2002 and were only
released after paying large bail sums. One detainee, Saeid Madani, paid one billion
rials, a sum equivalent to more than U.S.$500,000 at the official exchange rate.
Prison 59, located in a Revolutionary Guard military installation in Eshratabad
in central Tehran, is an unregulated detention facility outside the official penal system.
All of the detainees, many of whom were elderly, complained of harsh treatment
while in detention, including being beaten by their captors and, for much of
the time, being held in small cells where they could only lie in a cramped position.
Detention conditions for several elderly prisoners were a cause of particular
concern. Ezzatollah Sahhabi, more than seventy years old, was hospitalized twice
with heart attacks. His medications were adjusted, but he was not been permitted
to meet with his own doctor.Another prisoner, Dr.Habibollah Payman, sixty-six, a
dentist, suffered from severe kidney and urinary tract problems, but was given only
limited toilet access. He was forced to use the drinking vessel in his cell to relieve
himself, rinsing it out when given access to the bathroom. Dr. Raeis Toussi, sixtyfive,
a law professor at Tehran University, had one interrogation session that lasted
more than twenty-four hours and three that exceeded eighteen hours each, all of
which exacerbated a serious back injury. He was held in solitary confinement for
168 days. During the detentions, the judiciary blocked access to the detainees and
prevented President Khatami from sending an observer to visit them.
A third trial arising from the March and April 2001 arrests involved Habibollah
Peyman, leader of the Militant Muslims Movement (Junbash-i Musalmanan-i
Mubarez). His closed-door trial began in Tehran on April 7. He, too, was released
on payment of substantial bail, after spending more than a year in detention,much
of it incommunicado in solitary confinement. His lawyer complained that he was
deprived of access to prosecution documents relating to the case.There was no outcome
in this trial at this writing.
In other political proceedings, the conservative-dominated judiciary convicted
several politicians allied with President Khatami. In January, Member of Parliament
(M.P.) Hossein Loghmanian was sentenced to ten months in prison.He had
been convicted for insulting the judiciary in a speech he gave to Parliament, criticizing
the arbitrary closure of newspapers, and protesting the imprisonment of
political prisoners. Leader of the Islamic Republic Ayatollah Ali Khamenei pardoned
the jailed reformist M.P. after a walkout by members of Parliament.
Two prominent jailed journalists,Emadedin Baqi and Akbar Ganji, remained in
prison. Four other prisoners—Mohssen Youssefi Eshkevari,Ali Afshari,Khalil Rostamkhani,
and Saeid Sadre—continued serving sentences for their participation in
the March 2000 Berlin conference. (See Human Rights Watch World Report 2001.)
In April, another prominent reformist journalist, Ahmed Zeid Abadi, received a
twenty-three-month jail term for spreading propaganda against the state and insulting officials.He had been detained two years previously for seven months.He
remained free on bail pending appeal.
On July 2, a court in Hamedan announced that it had summoned Hashem
Aghajari, a leader of the Mojahedine of the Islamic Revolution Organization
(MIRO), to face charges of insulting religious sanctities.The charges followed a celebrated
speech he made in June criticizing the clergy’s role in politics and urging
disobedience of senior clerical leaders on religious grounds. MIRO was an important
strand of the coalition of reformist groups in the Parliament and Aghajari’s
blunt comments indicated growing frustration among some reformists over the
lack of progress. In November, a Revolutionary Court sentenced Aghajari to death
for blasphemy and insulting the clergy. His lawyer filed an appeal against the sentence
in December.
Behrouz Geranpayeh, the head of the National Institute for Opinion Polls, was
detained in October and held incommunicado for more than a month while under
interrogation after publishing a poll showing the majority of Iranians favored
restoring relations with the United States. In November, two heads of private
research institutes that had conducted the poll,Abbas Abdi and Hossein Ali Ghazian,
also prominent reformist figures, were arrested. They faced charges of “collaboration
with U.S. elements and British Intelligence” and of conducting
“psychological warfare” aimed at overthrowing the government.
Other notable incidents of arbitrary detention included that of Siamak
Pourzand, a seventy-three-year-old journalist seized outside his sister’s house in
November 2001.He was then held in an unknown location before being brought to
trial, in secret, in March.With their disregard for pre-trial safeguards, the proceedings
flagrantly violated fair trial standards. The journalist was released in November,
but remained under threat of prosecution.
In June, an Iranian dancer,Mohamad Khordadian, who had been living in Los
Angeles for twenty-two years before returning to visit his family, was arrested on
charges of corrupting public morality.At his trial he received a ten-year suspended
prison term and was banned from returning to the United States. In September, an
actress, who kissed a film director at a film festival, was also prosecuted for corrupting
public morality. These high-profile prosecutions exemplified attempts by
hardline conservatives to generate public concern over a supposed decline in public
morality, of which they were the self-appointed guardians.
Senior Shi’a religious leaders and their supporters who dissented from the ruling
clerical establishment remained targets of official persecution. A telling incident
occurred in Qom in December 2001, at the funeral for Grand Ayatollah
Mohammad Shirazi, a leading clerical figure who questioned the form of government
in the Islamic Republic.At the funeral, his body was seized by security forces
and interred in Hazrat-i Masumeh mosque, the major shrine in the city. He had
expressed his wish to be buried on the grounds of his house, but the authorities
apparently feared that his tomb might become a rallying point for clerical opposition.
Grand Ayatollah Hossain Ali Montazeri, the former designated successor to Ayatollah
Khomeini as Leader of the Islamic Republic, remained under house arrest in
Qom, although his ideas continued to circulate widely.
Iran’s religious and ethnic minorities remained subject to discrimination and
persecution. Representatives of the predominantly Sunni Muslim Kurdish minority
protested the appointment of a new governor of Kurdistan province from the
Shi’a majority. The authorities overlooked Sunni candidates for the post put forward
by Kurdish parliamentarians. The lack of public school education in Kurdish
language remained a perennial source of Kurdish frustration.
The banned Kurdish opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party of Iran
(PDKI), which had engaged in armed opposition to the government, announced
that the Iranian government had executed Karim Toujali in Mahabad on January
24, 2002. Toujali had sought political asylum in Turkey, but had been unsuccessful
in his claim. Turkish police then forcibly returned him to Iran. In October, another
PDKI prisoner, Hamzeh Ghaderi, was executed in Orumieh. The PDKI claimed
that another five supporters were executed with Ghaderi. Other PDKI supporters
reportedly remained in jail facing execution.
The ten Jewish Iranians sentenced to prison in Shiraz in 2000 were released in
October after appeals for their release by the representative of the Jewish community
in Parliament, Maurice Motamed. Some of the prisoners had served longer
than their allotted sentences.Throughout the year,Motamed also drew attention to
institutional discrimination against religious minorities, including continued limits
on access to educational opportunities and employment. In August, in a bold
move, he proposed a bill calling for equivalence in the amount of Diyeh (blood
money) between Muslims and non-Muslims. The Qisas (retribution) system of
criminal law specifies penalties for various crimes which differ according to the religion
of the victim and the perpetrator. In general, non-Muslims are subject to
harsher penalties and enjoy fewer protections than Muslims.Motamed’s bill,which
remained under consideration at the end of the year, would remove these discrepancies
although it would not apply to Iran’s largest religious minority, followers of
the Baha’i faith.
Baha’is also continued to face persecution, including being denied permission
to worship or to carry out other communal affairs publicly. At least four Baha’is
were serving prison terms for their religious beliefs. Bihnam Mithaqi and Kayvan
Khalajabadi, imprisoned since 1989,were informed in January that their sentences
would run until 2004.Musa Talibi, imprisoned in 1994, was held in Isfahan. It was
not clear whether his death sentence had been commuted. Zhabihullah Mahrami,
imprisoned since 1995 and convicted of apostasy, had his death sentence commuted
in March.
The campaign by conservatives against moral decline, noted above, was accompanied
by an increase in public executions and corporal punishment. In October,
the authorities carried out public executions of five men convicted of a series of
attacks on women in Tehran. Their bodies were hoisted on mobile cranes and
driven through the city. In Hamedan, on October 15, two thieves convicted of more
than thirty robberies each had four fingers amputated in a public ceremony.
With the collapse of the Taliban government in Afghanistan, hundreds of thousands
of Afghan refugees who had been living in Iran began to return. The United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) expressed concern that Iranian
authorities were exerting pressure on Afghan refugees to leave, a charge denied by the Iranian government. Some one million Afghan refugees remained in Iran at
this writing.
Shadowy underground paramilitary forces, linked to hardline conservative clerical
leaders unwilling to relinquish their continuing grip on power, continued to be
implicated in violent unrest.Sporadic clashes in the streets between crowds and riot
police supported by Basij, religious paramiltary forces, occurred at various times
throughout the year. One clash took place in October 2001 following Iran’s elimination
from the soccer World Cup. Although these clashes and demonstrations
often took on a political complexion, they tended to be small and easily contained
by the authorities.
Several thousand people marched in Tehran in July in what was becoming an
annual event to commemorate a 1999 raid by paramilitary forces on student dormitories
at Tehran University. At least four students detained in 1999—Ahmed
Batebi,Mehrdad Lohrassbi,Akbar Mohammadi and Manouchehr Mohammadi—
remained in prison serving long prison terms. There were sporadic clashes with
police and hardline vigilantes, but no serious disturbances. The major student
organization that supported the reform movement had urged its members to stay
away from the march for fear of provoking a clash with hardliners.
Students nationwide protested the death sentence imposed on Hashem Aghajari
in November. Protests subsided when senior clerical leaders threatened the students.
On November 22,Ayatollah Khamenei issued an ultimatum stating that students
should “return to their homes” or “the people will intervene” against them, a
thinly veiled threat to unleash the same paramilitary forces that the authorities had
used in July 1999 to crush student protests.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Access to the country for independent human rights investigators remained
restricted, although the government did declare its willingness to admit U.N.
special rapporteurs to the country. There continued to be lively discussion of
human rights issues in the press and in Parliament, although independent local
human rights groups were not permitted to function.
Several lawyers known for their defense of human rights were targets of prosecution.
Mohammad Dadkhah, part of the defense team of the Iranian Freedom
Movement, was sentenced to five months in prison in May. He was also banned
from practicing law for ten years.
The judiciary confirmed the sentences of several lawyers associated with
reformist causes, including cases relating to the assassinations of writers and intellectuals
in 1998. One lawyer,Nasser Zarafshan, was sentenced to five years in prison
and fifty lashes. The bar association described the flogging sentence as indefensible
and unjustifiable. The appeal was dismissed. Zarafshan had probed the involvement
of Ministry of Intelligence officials in the 1998 murders and claimed in the
press that there were more victims of these killings than had been mentioned in the
trial of officials involved in the killings.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
European Union
European and Iranian officials met repeatedly throughout the year to extend
cooperation in a range of areas, including counter-terrorism, trade, and the promotion
of human rights. The E.U. remained committed to a policy of engaging
with Iranian leaders, while at the same time giving human rights a high profile in
its public discourse about the relationship. E.U.Commissioner for External Affairs
Chris Patten told the BBC that the dialogue was aimed at bolstering Iranian
reformists, such as elected president Mohammad Khatami. “It can’t seriously be
anybody’s idea of a good way of promoting stability in the region to think that we
should isolate and cut Iran off forever,” he said. “If you don’t talk to the reasonable
people, you fetch up with fewer reasonable people to talk to.”
The improvement of relations with the E.U. remained vulnerable to interference
by hardliners opposed to such normalization. In March, the planned visit to Berlin
of Speaker of Parliament Hojatoleslam Mehdi Karrubi was canceled when Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder declined to receive him, a decision that many observers
believed resulted from political machinations by Iran’s conservative judiciary.
Schroeder was displeased with the apparently punitive transfer of Said Sadr to a
remote and notorious prison near the Afghan border in advance of Karrubi’s visit.
Sadr, an Iranian employee at the German embassy in Tehran, had been imprisoned
in Iran since the controversial Berlin Conference in 2000. Shortly before his
planned trip, Karrubi apparently had angered hardliners by telling German journalists
that he was trying to secure Sadr’s release; the judiciary responded by transferring
Sadr to the remote prison, derailing the visit.
In a move likely to please the Iranian government, the E.U. recognized the Mojahedine
Khalq Organization (MKO) as a terrorist group on May 3. The MKO was
based in Iraq and launched armed attacks against Iranian targets. It was described
as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department.The E.U., however,
did not include the affiliated National Council of Resistance in its designation.
On June 17, the E.U. placed human rights at the top of a list of four areas in
which it wanted to see improvements through its policy of engagement with Iran:
(1) human rights and fundamental freedoms; (2) non-proliferation; (3) terrorism;
and (4) the Middle East peace process.
In September, Iran approved a new British ambassador. The move ended an
eight-month diplomatic dispute following Tehran’s rejection in January of David
Reddaway, described by conservative newspapers in Iran as a Zionist and a spy. It
was an indicator of the importance given to Iran by the E.U. and the U.K. that
embarrassing incidents of this nature were not permitted to stall the momentum of
engagement.British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw traveled to Iran in October to further
advance the relationship but was met by an upturn in political and public executions,
interpreted by many as another example of the conservatives using their
control over the judiciary to seek to influence Iran’s foreign policy.
United Nations
In April, during the fifty-eigth session of the U.N. Commission on Human
Rights, a draft resolution criticizing the situation in Iran was defeated by a roll-call
vote of twenty to nineteen, with fourteen abstentions, marking the first time in
more than fifteen years that a resolution criticizing Iran’s human rights practices
did not pass at the commission. It brought to an end the mandate of the U.N.
special representative on human rights in Iran and was seen as a major victory for
Iranian diplomacy. The Iranian government regarded the special representative’s
mandate as political and repeatedly blocked his access to the country, despite the
balanced and constructive tone of his reporting over many years.
In July, Iran said it would give immediate access to United Nations thematic rapporteurs
to allow them to examine its human rights record. Iran’s ambassador,
Mohammed Reza Alborzi, told High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary
Robinson that specialists would “be welcome.” By the end of the year no visits had
taken place.
United States
Possibilities for an improvement in U.S.-Iranian relations based on the shared
goal of removing the Taliban from power in Afghanistan were not realized due to
continuing U.S. concerns over Iranian support for terrorism. Such concerns were
exemplified by the seizure of the Karine A, caught smuggling weapons from Iran to
the Palestinian Authority.
President Bush’s characterization of Iran, Iraq, and North Korea as an “axis of
evil” during his January 29 State of the Union address caused anger in Iran across
all factions within the clerical leadership. It fueled expectations among parts of
public opinion that the U.S. would intervene directly in Iran, as it had in Afghanistan,
and change the government. The government and many Iranians resented
this implied interference in their affairs.
In July,President Bush issued a subtler statement that, though barely reported in
the U.S., sparked much debate in Iran. It came a few days after clashes between students
and police in Tehran on the anniversary of the 1999 student demonstrations
and the resignation of a prominent cleric, Ayatollah Jalaledine Taheri, who had
accused the Iranian authorities of corruption and repression. In his written statement,
President Bush expressed solidarity with the students, saying, “their government
should listen to their hopes.” In a targeted phrase, the president urged Iran’s
un-elected leaders to abandon policies that denied Iranians the opportunities and
rights of people elsewhere. In singling out un-elected leaders for criticism the President
appeared to be differentiating between factions within the Iranian power
structure.This more measured approach to Iran made the U.S. government’s statements
an important influence on human rights conditions in the country for the
first time in many years.
The U.S. continued to block Iran’s access to loans from international financial
institutions. For example, in September, the U.S. blocked the private-sector financing
arm of the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation, from investing U.S.$2 million in an Iranian company. The World Bank had planned to lend Iran
hundreds of millions of dollars, but the U.S. effectively blocked the deals.
In March, the U.S. State Department’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices
for 2001 called the Iranian government’s human rights record “poor” and
detailed significant restrictions on citizens’ right to change their government. In
September, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom identified
Iran, together with eleven other states, as countries of particular concern with
respect to violations of the rights to freedom of religion.
Iranians worried about U.S. military action in nearby Afghanistan and threatened
action in Iraq, but they were also interested in the administration’s strong
rhetoric supporting democracy and human rights in Iran. The openness of Iranians
to the U.S. was seen in September when the state news agency, IRNA, published
the results of a public opinion poll showing that 75 percent of Iranians favored a
dialogue between Iran and the United States, and almost 50 percent approved of
U.S. policy toward the country. The judiciary responded by closing down the institute
that conducted the poll and prosecuting the poll’s director and the director of
the news agency that published it. Some conservative leaders even called for the
criminalization of advocating dialogue or normalization with the United States.
However, the reformists appeared emboldened by the public mood. President
Khatami admonished the critics of dialogue and expressed his own willingness to
enter into discussions with the United State without preconditions.
