TURKEY
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
At last European Union (E.U.) pressure for Turkey to meet its political and
human rights criteria for membership began to produce substantial results. In February
and August, the government passed legislative packages that provided
improved access to legal counsel for police detainees, abolished the death penalty,
and permitted broadcasting and education in minority languages. The August legislation
was pushed through by the then-ruling coalition partners Democratic Left
Party and Motherland Party, but fiercely opposed by the third partner, the extreme
right-wing Nationalist Action Party, which condemned the E.U.’s demands for
change as identical to those of illegal armed organizations. The legislative changes
left serious constraints on free expression unaddressed, however, and torture continued
to be widespread.
In November, the conservative and religious Justice and Development Party
(AKP) won the general election. AKP party leader Recep Tayyip Erdog˘an was
excluded from the election and could not be appointed prime minister because he
had been stripped of political rights after serving a ten-month prison sentence
imposed for a non-violent speech made in 1997.
The state of emergency was lifted in the provinces of Tunceli and Hakkari in July,
and in the last two provinces, Diyarbakır and Þırnak, in November. The mainly
Kurdish southeast had been under martial law or state of emergency since 1978.
In August, the Turkish parliament voted to abolish the death penalty for peacetime
offences. The sentences of eighty-seven prisoners on death row were commuted
to life imprisonment. Turkey carried out its last judicial execution in 1984.
Parliament tentatively reformed laws inhibiting freedom of expression, but
courts still imprisoned those who insulted state institutions or addressed sensitive
questions about Kurdish minority rights or the role of the military or religion in
politics. Ahmet Ünlü was imprisoned on a two-and-a-half-year sentence in January
for “incitement to religious hatred” for comments he made describing the 1999
earthquake as a “heavenly warning” to a society that had departed from Islamic
principles. Kurdish villager Tayyar Taß was arrested in July for “insulting” the military
by accusing them of burning his village.He was released in September but his
trial continued.
Minority languages, particularly Kurdish, were a controversial issue. From
December 2001 onward, police detained more than a thousand school and university
students for submitting petitions calling for optional courses in Kurdish. Prosecutors
indicted hundreds of the students on charges of supporting an armed gang,
claiming the students’ campaign for Kurdish language courses was run by a new
illegal movement called Kurdistan Freedom and Democracy (KADEK), formed in
April out of the dissolved Kurdish Workers’ Party (PKK). In April,Diyarbakır State
Security Court handed down a suspended sentence of forty-five months of imprisonment to minibus driver Sulhattin Önen for repeatedly playing a cassette tape of
a song in Kurdish. The court was unswayed by the fact that the tape was legally
authorized for publication.
The August legislation lifted restrictions on minority language courses and
broadcasting, including in Kurdish. The change seemed to represent a new respect
for linguistic diversity, but the reforms were hedged with qualifications that could
block effective implementation.Kurdish still could not be taught in universities, or
broadcast by independent radio or television stations.
Restrictions on other aspects of free expression remained. Governors throughout
the country continued to ban plays, films, and exhibitions,while courts confiscated
many newspapers and scores of books for “separatism.” State educational
institutions continued to apply the ban on women wearing the headscarf for religious
reasons.Thousands of female students were denied access to high school and
university education because they wore the headscarf. Teachers and doctors were
also dismissed for wearing the headscarf on duty.
Torture and ill-treatment remained widespread in police stations and gendarmeries,
facilitated by the continued practice of holding detainees without access
to legal counsel. Those detained for common criminal offenses had a legal right to
see a lawyer throughout police custody but this was commonly denied. The provision
that those detained for offenses under the jurisdiction of state security courts
could legally be held without access to a lawyer for four days was in place until February,
when this was reduced to two days.
Even after this change, many detainees reported torture by beating, sexual violence,
death threats, hosing with cold water, and electric shocks. Blindfolding also
continued unchecked. Victims included people detained for common criminal
offenses and women, many of whom reported rape or other sexual violence. One
detainee, accused of supporting an illegal organization, reported that during four
days’ interrogation without access to legal counsel at Istanbul Police Headquarters
in March, she was blindfolded, stripped naked, sprayed with cold water through a
hose forced into her vagina, and forced to sit in excrement. In the same month,
another female detainee reported that during interrogation for her alleged links
with an illegal armed organization police officers at the Anti-Terror Branch of
Mardin Police Headquarters stripped her naked, hosed her with cold water, and
inserted a truncheon in her anus.Medical reports were consistent with her allegations
of torture.
Again, victims of torture and other human rights violations encountered many
obstacles to obtaining a remedy through Turkish courts. In January, the public
prosecutor dismissed formal complaints made by eight male prisoners that gendarmes
anally raped them with truncheons on arrival at Kandıra F-type Prison in
December 2000.According to the plaintiffs’ lawyer, the prosecutor did not question
some of the plaintiffs or consult medical reports. Several potential prosecutions
were blocked under the Law on the Prosecution of Civil Servants, permitting local
governors, even though they are not members of the judiciary, to halt prosecutions.
Courts continued to prefer to convict torturers on the less serious charge of illtreatment.
In April, Istanbul Criminal Court found two Istanbul Anti-Terror
Branch officers guilty of hanging Abdurrahim Demir by the arms and squeezing his testicles, beating him on the soles of the feet, and giving him electric shocks. The
court decided that this was merely ill-treatment. Since convictions for ill-treatment
(unlike those for torture) were covered by a conditional amnesty, the officers had
their sentences suspended.
Tension continued in the new F-type prisons,where prisoners remanded or sentenced
for offenses under state security court jurisdiction were held in one- and
three-person cells, replacing the large ward-based prisons traditional in Turkey’s
prison system. Prisoners continued to hunger-strike in protest against killings by
security forces during the original violent transfers in December 2000, the strict
regime in F-type prisons, and the restricted opportunities for association with
other prisoners. At the time of writing, fourteen hunger-strikers had died during
2002, bringing the total number to sixty-four since the 2000 transfer. Relatives and
lawyers reported that prisoners were suffering health problems associated with
small group isolation, including sensory loss, skin complaints, tinnitus, stomach
disorders, and severe mental disturbance. The Justice Ministry announced but
failed to implement a program in F-type prisons of out-of-cell activities and a
weekly period of five hours’ association.
Violence by armed illegal political organizations continued to abate, but there
were isolated reports of attacks on civilians. In June, the Workers’ and Peasants Liberation
Army of Turkey (TIKKO) reportedly abducted and killed Muharrem Hız
from Sırçalı village, Tokat province.
Most villagers forcibly displaced from their homes in the southeast during the
1990s were unable to return, despite increased stability in the region. In some cases
local governors obstructed returns, villagers were turned back by gendarmerie, or
found that neighboring paramilitary village guards had occupied their lands. The
government’s Return to Village and Rehabilitation Project moved so slowly and was
so poorly designed and funded that it offered little benefit to the displaced.
Asylum seekers arriving in Turkey were frequently denied proper protection.
Under a geographical reservation to the 1951 Refugee Convention, Turkey continued
to recognize only refugees from Europe. Non-European asylum seekers were
required to register with the police,who were then supposed to carry out an assessment
to determine whether their claim to require asylum was well-founded. The
assessment did not include the minimum safeguards required by international law
for fair refugee status determination. Only those who passed this police assessment
were referred to the offices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR), and those who were recognized as refugees by UNHCR then had to
await resettlement to a third country, sometimes for lengthy periods during which
many remained at risk.During 2001, the Turkish authorities reported that they had
arrested ninety-four thousand migrants who were transiting or being smuggled
across the country, at great hazard to their own lives, including many would-be asylum
seekers entering from Iran and northern Iraq and heading toward the more
secure protection afforded by Western European states. According to the United
States Committee for Refugees, many such migrants, often arrested during urban
sweeps, were summarily returned to Turkey’s neighbors, and around a hundred
clear cases of refoulement (forced return to a country where one’s life or freedom
is threatened) were documented during 2001.
The August reform legislation added Turkish criminal code provisions that
imposed heavy prison sentences for the smuggling or trafficking of persons, but
Turkey continued to lack services for victims. Turkey provided no shelter or protection
to trafficking victims, deporting all foreigners found in commercial sex
work without screening to identify trafficked persons. Turkey signed the Trafficking
Protocol supplementing the Convention Against Transnational Organized
Crime, but at this writing, the government had not ratified the protocol. Despite a
1998 law creating protection orders, domestic violence continued unabated.
Women for Women’s Human Rights, a nongovernmental organization in Turkey,
called violence against women “one of the most widespread violations of human
rights in Turkey.” Honor killings also threatened women throughout Turkey. In
March, twenty-year-old Pınar Kaçmaz died when her father and brother riddled
her with bullets in a southeastern Turkish city.According to news reports, the police
had arrested Kacmaz’s father after she had reported that he threatened her life, but
he was released pending trial.
Landmines laid by the government along the borders, and by both sides in the
conflict between the security forces and the PKK, killed eleven people, including
four children. Following Turkey’s 2001 declaration that it would join the Ottawa
Convention banning antipersonnel mines, it took important steps toward accession
but had not completed procedures by late October.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Turkish human rights defenders still faced numerous hazards in their work.
They were subjected to a hail of judicial investigations and prosecutions under the
repressive and unwieldy law on associations, as well as the Anti-Terror Law, the Law
on Demonstrations, and various articles of the criminal code.At this writing, Istanbul
Human Rights Association (HRA) members faced eighty-eight ongoing trials,
most relating to press statements protesting violations. The lawyer Osman Baydemir,
president of Diyarbakır HRA, faced thirty-one ongoing trials carrying a possible
total of nearly ninety years of imprisonment. Police and local governors
repeatedly prohibited or intervened to disperse meetings and peaceful demonstrations
by human rights organizations.
In June, Dr. Alp Ayan and Mehmet Barındık of the Izmir Treatment Center of
the Turkish Human Rights Foundation were sentenced to a year’s imprisonment
for making a press statement critical of the Justice Ministry’s handling of the F-type
prison crisis. The defendants appealed.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
Several years after his first request for a visit, U.N. Representative of the Secretary-
General on Internally Displaced Persons Dr. Francis Deng, was finally permitted to visit Turkey in May. In a brief public statement in June, Dr. Deng called on
the government to formulate a clear, transparent policy on return and encouraged
the government to involve intergovernmental organizations and civil society in the
process.
The special rapporteur on extrajudicial, arbitrary, and summary executions,
Asma Jahangir, published a report on her February 2001 visit to Turkey, noting that
there were violations of the right to life even while she was in the country. The rapporteur
made inquiries into the “disappearance” of Serdar Tanıß and Ebubekir
Deniz, officials from the People’s Democracy Party (HADEP) after they had presented
themselves at the Silopi district gendarmerie in Þırnak in January 2001, and
she reported that she “did not get a sense that the civil authorities had sufficient
power to investigate the District Gendarme Commander.”
With respect to “honor” killings, the special rapporteur criticized the provisions
of the penal code reducing the sentence of the perpetrators of such crimes to a
token punishment if the court considers that there was “grave provocation.” She
noted that the longstanding conflict in the southeast had overshadowed and marginalized
the issue of women’s right to life in that region.
The rapporteur concluded that state agents had been able to commit extrajudicial
executions, confident that their crimes would not be investigated. She recommended
that the government set up a high-level commission with strong powers to
undertake fact-finding in cases where people have allegedly been killed by the security
forces.
Council of Europe
The Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) visited Turkey in March
and September, and maintained its vigilance concerning conditions in F-type prisons
as well as torture in police custody. In its report on the March visit, the CPT criticized
the Justice Ministry’s decision to make access to weekly association
conditional on participation in the program of out-of-cell activities and recommended
that the link be dropped. In September, the justice minister removed the
formal condition, but problems in implementation persisted.
The CPT indicated that it had received “a considerable number of allegations of
ill-treatment” in Diyarbakır during its March visit and attributed this in great part
to police interference with detainees’ right to legal counsel. The CPT discovered
that almost all of those detained at the Anti-Terror Branch and the Narcotics Section
at Diyarbakır Police Headquarters in the nine months prior to its visit
(amounting to hundreds of detainees) were recorded as having waived their right
of access to a lawyer.
The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) issued judgments against
Turkey in more than forty cases.The cases involved the imprisonment of people for
their non-violent opinions or after unfair trials, as well as unlawful killings and
arbitrary house destruction by the Turkish security forces.
In May, the Committee ofMinisters publicly and strongly urged Turkey to comply
with its “repeated demands” to respond to the July 2001 ruling of the ECHR,
which found that Kurdish former parliamentary deputies Hatip Dicle, Orhan Dog˘an, Selim Sadak, and Leyla Zana had been sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment
in 1994 after an unfair trial. The government of Turkey failed to comply
with the committee’s demands. In fact, a provision of the August legislation deliberately
blocked the possible release of the deputies. The new legislation required
Turkish courts to review verdicts that the ECHR finds violate the European Convention
on Human Rights, but a proviso denied this right to past applicants to the
ECHR, who included the four jailed former parliamentarians.
In July, the Committee of Ministers adopted a further resolution calling on
Turkey to take steps to respond to the succession of judgments at the ECHR concerning
killings, torture,“disappearances,” and destruction of property committed
by the Turkish security forces.
The Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) retained its human rights monitoring
mechanism for Turkey. In March, John Connor, the rapporteur of the PACE Committee
on Migration,Refugees and Demography, published his report on his October
2001 visit to Turkey to examine the situation of internally displaced people.The
rapporteur called for the government to increase the pace of returns and to involve
the displaced, as well as international humanitarian organizations and local municipalities,
in preparing and implementing return and reintegration projects. Connor’s
recommendations broadly reflected the committee’s 1998 recommendations,
which the Turkish government had largely ignored.
European Union
The process of Turkey’s accession to the E.U. remained the most important catalyst
of reform in Turkey. The E.U.’s progress report for 2001 had made it clear that
Turkey was lagging behind in its efforts to meet the E.U. accession conditions of
“democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of
minorities.” Civil society bodies ranging from human rights organizations to the
employers’ federation, TUSIAD, as well as President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, put considerable
pressure on the government to produce results.Parliament finally enacted
the February and August legislation in order to maintain the credibility of its candidacy
for E.U. membership. The E.U. Presidency gave a warm welcome to the
August abolition of the death penalty and language reforms, but on an appropriate
note of skepticism, added that Turkey should implement the changes as soon as
possible in order to demonstrate the genuine character of the reforms. The October
regular report on Turkey’s progress toward accession pointed to the need for
further progress in protecting freedom of expression, combating torture, and
reducing the influence of the military.
United States
Turkey remained a critical U.S. ally in the war against terrorism, taking the lead
of international peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan. The U.S. was a strong public
supporter of Turkey’s application for membership in the E.U. and persistently used
quiet diplomacy to encourage the reforms necessary for that application to 
progress.
The State Department’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2001 surveyed
continuing abuses, including restrictions on speech, the press, and the wearing
of the headscarf; “disappearances”; and extrajudicial killings. The report stated
that torture remained widespread, attributing slight declines to the decreased use
of incommunicado detention and the reduction in the number of detentions.
Human Rights Watch’s inquiries and those of the CPT cited above suggested that
detention without access to counsel remained the general rule.
Turkish Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk responded to the State Department
report saying that it contained “extremely unfair allegations” and said that the Foreign
Ministry would take initiatives to correct suggestions that some minorities
were exposed to discrimination.
The State Department’s annual trafficking in persons report gave Turkey its
lowest ranking, concluding that Turkey made almost no efforts to combat trafficking.
In August, however, the U.S. ambassador to the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) described the new anti-trafficking law,which contained
no measures to protect adult or child victims of trafficking, as “a major step
forward in the Turkish government’s anti-trafficking policy and enforcement.”
