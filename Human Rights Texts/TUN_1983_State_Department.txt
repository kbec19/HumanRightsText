 TUNISIA
 An Arab state in North Africa, Tunisia is presided over by Habib
 Bourguiba, President for Life, who celebrated his eightieth
 birthday in 1983. The Tunisian Constitution provides for
 parliamentary institutions and guarantees basic human rights.
 Most opposition political activity continued to be legally
 circumscribed during 1983. However, two opposition parties, the
 Social Democractic Movement and a branch of the Popular Unity
 Movement, were legalized on November 19, joining the Communist
 Party, which had been legalized several years previously. The
 Government also announced in November that legislation would be
 prepared to define the conditions for the legal functioning of all
 political parties.
 As a result of the Tunisian Government's commitment to mass
 education for both sexes, the Tunisian population is increasingly
 well-educated. Women enjoy equal legal status with men under
 Tunisian law in almost all respects, but traditional attitudes
 restrict participation by women in the country's economic and
 political life.
 Economically, Tunisia grew steadily during the decade of the
 seventies, although growth in the eighties has slowed
 considerably. The Tunisian Government encourages both private
 sector and state-run enterprise. Of particular note, Tunisia has
 a genuine trade union movement independent of government control.
 During 1983, the Tunisian General Trade Union Federation
 negotiated new wage agreements with employer representatives and
 the government, and the Federation played an important role in the
 economic life of the country.
 In addition to the legally-recognized opposition political
 parties, several opposition groups were offically tolerated and
 allowed to publish newspapers, although they were not granted
 legal status under a selectively-enforced law which required
 government permission for political activity. The law was
 invoked, however, against a group of 22 Islamic fundamentalists
 arrested in January 1983 for failing to gain permission for their
 activities. All but two members of this group were released
 following their trial in July, when they were given a six-month
 sentence, which corresponded to the length of time they had
 already served. Some Islamic fundamentalists sentenced in 1981 on
 similar charges remain in prison; others were released during 1983
 after having served two-thirds of their sentences. A leader of
 the movement was released on compassionate grounds, but he remains
 under house arrest.
 There was evidence during 1983 that physical mistreatment by the
 police sometimes occurs, both against common law offenders and
 political detainees. There can be delays of weeks or even months
 while detainees are interrogated by the security police, although
 all detainees are eventually given access to lawyers and family
 and brought to trial.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There were no instances of politically-motivated murders in
 Tunisia during 1983.
 
 (1443)
 
 
 1444
 b. Disappearance
 In the case of the arrest during 1983 of certain political
 activists, there were delays of several days before families were
 informed, but all arrested persons were eventually given access
 to family and lawyers.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is not systematic or officially condoned in Tunisia, but
 there is reliable evidence that physical and psychological abuse
 of prisoners by security authorities does occur. For example,
 during the trial of Islamic activists in July, defense lawyers
 pointed to.marks on the bodies of defendants as evidence of
 physical mistreatment. At the trial of a group of 12 persons
 charged with possession of dynamite and planning acts of
 violence, one of the defendants claimed to be unable to stand
 because of torture by the security police. Charges of torture
 were also made at the trial on August 26 of a group of 30 Islamic
 activists, including 19 military personnel, who were members of
 the "Islamic Liberation Party."
 There is also evidence of routine physical brutality by police in
 the case od some common law offenders, and although it is thought
 that senior officials sometimes turn a blind eye to such abuses,
 there are no known examples to cite. There is also no known
 evidence.that any official was punished for alleged excessive
 brutality. Conditions in Tunisian detention centers and prisons
 are poor and sometimes so bad as to be injurious to health.
 Police brutality and unhealthful prison conditions are
 occasionally the subject of discussion between the Ministry of
 the Interior and the Tunisian League of Human Rights. As a
 result, there are instances where conditions have been improved.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 During 1983 there were several instances of arrest and detention
 on political charges in accordance-with a law which requires
 government permission prior to political activity or formation of
 a political party. A group of five individuals was arrested in
 January and interrogated by security authorities for several
 weeks on charges of unauthorized political activity. All were
 released without formal charges. The group of 22 activists
 arrested in January 1983 was brought to trial July 27 on charges
 of unauthorized political activity. Besides the 18 individuals
 sentenced to time served, two others were found innocent, and two
 were sentenced to one year in prison. In separate proceedings,
 16 other persons were sentenced in absentia to prison terms of
 one year.
 There is reliable evidence that security police occasionally
 detain'members of the families of fugitives to force those
 persons to turn themselves in. Security authorities continue to
 detain suspected persons for prolonged periods without bringing
 formal charges before a magistrate.
 a. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 No secret trials were held in Tunisia during 1983, and there were
 no cases of trials in special security courts. In all cases,
 defendants had access to legal counsel. A trial of
 
 
 1445
 thirty members of the "Islamic Liberation Party" on August 27 was
 held in military court under applicable provisions of Tunisian
 law, as 19 of the defendants were military personnel. The trial
 itself, however, lasted only one day, and defense lawyers were
 denied their request for a postponement. Political pressures are
 sometimes brought to bear on magistrates in cases involving
 political charges, and sentences in such cases often reflect
 these pressures.
 The Tunisian Human Rights League, an independent watchdog group,
 counted 102 political prisoners in Tunisia at the close of 1983.
 This number included 28 persons convicted of either planning or
 carrying out acts of violence.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The privacy of the individual and of the home are generally
 respected in Tunisia. Despite that fact, the Tunisian Security
 police sometimes secure blanket rather than specific judicial
 authorization for the arrest of individuals suspected of
 activities posing a security threat to the government. Isolated
 incidents of the monitoring of correspondence and of telephones
 do occur. Informer systems may exist, but there is no specific
 evidence to support that conclusion. In practice, the Security
 police are not an obtrusive presence in Tunisia, and Tunisians
 feel generally free to criticize the Government (although not the
 President personally) and its policies without fear of being
 punished for dissident views.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Tunisian law requires government permission prior to publica-
 tion. Government officials can seize offending publications and
 levy fines, although during 1983 this discretionary power was
 rarely exercised. Several opposition weekly newspapers were
 allowed to publish without hindrance. As stated earlier,
 opposition publications may not criticize President Bourguiba in
 a direct and personal way. An independent weekly news magazine
 resumed publication in 1983 after a period of suspension. Radio
 and television remain government monopolies and carry no
 criticism of government policies.
 A wide variety of Western and Arabic language publications are
 available in the country. Censorship seldom interferes with
 their distribution. Books published in Tunisia and abroad
 critical of government policies are sold freely.
 Academic freedom is fully respected, and scholarly research is
 not subject to interference.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Tunisian Constitution guarantees freedom of assembly, but a
 law remains on the books, as indicated earlier, requiring
 government permission for the holding of political meetings.
 Opposition political groups ignored this requirement frequently
 during 1983, and government authorities generally did not
 interfere, except for the instances already noted, with
 opposition activities. In late November, President Bourguiba
 announced the Government's intention to introduce legislation
 
 
 1446
 that would legalize the functioning of all political parties.
 The Tunisian General Trade Union Federation, a potentially
 important source of political opposition, held meetings
 throughout the country during 1983 without government hindrance.
 The Federation and professional associations are allowed
 unhindered association with international bodies in their
 fields. Professional associations are also active in Tunisia.
 The Tunisian General Human Rights League, an independent
 observation group with branches in many parts of the country,
 holds regular meetings, as does the legal Tunisian Communist
 Party.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although Islam is the state religion of Tunisia, the consti-
 tutional guarantees of religious freedom were fully respected in
 1983. The Tunisian Jewish community worship freely and maintain
 indigenous organizations with official protection. Christians,
 mostly non-Tunisians, freely attend church services.
 Proselytizing for religions other than Islam is discouraged.
 Under an agreement between the Vatican and the Tunisian
 Government, several Roman Catholic orders are active in the
 country. There is no religious discrimination in private
 commerce and employment, although government employment is
 generally reserved for Muslims.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is no requirement for an internal passport in Tunisia and
 unfettered movement within the country is allowed. Passports-for
 foreign travel are easily available, although there may be
 isolated instances of a passport's being withheld if it is
 suspected that an individual has clandestine links to a foreign
 government. There is no restriction on emigration or
 repatriation.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 High government office is effectively restricted to members of
 the Socialist Destourian (Constitutional) Party. Three secular
 political parties are also allowed to function. There were no
 national elections during 1983. Political.activity by Islamic
 political groups is not allowed by the government. Partici-
 pation in politics by women is limited by traditional attitudes,
 but during 1983 two women were appointed to ministerial rank by
 President Bourguiba. Seven of 132 members of Parliament are
 women. In the Parliament, government policies are debated and
 often criticized. Overall, the political system remains
 centralized but generally responsive to public opinion.
 Section 4 Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Tunisian Human Rights League has access to senior govern-
 ment officials, and in some cases the Tunisian Government has
 taken corrective action in response to complaints by the League,
 notably with regard to the improvement of prison conditions.
 
 
 1447
 The League publishes a regular bulletin which details reported
 human rights abuses. Tunisia also has shown a willingness to
 speak out to criticize human rights abuses in other countries.
 In its 1983 Report, Amnesty International expressed its concern
 for the imprisonment of "46 prisoners of conscience" and for
 incidents of "torture of political detainees." Freedom House
 rates Tunisia "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Tunisia's resources continue to be heavily devoted to education.
 and to economic and social development. There have been
 impressive gains in-all of these areas. Annual per capita income
 rose to some 91400, although this figure has fallen with a
 hardening dollar and conceals regional disparities and pockets of
 severe poverty. School enrollment ratios are high, with 102
 percent of the eligible age group in 1979 enrolled in primary
 school. Primary school enrollment of girls was 85 percent in
 1979 and 119 percent for boys. Roughly one-third of the
 country's operating budget goes to education, and of a population
 of some seven million in 1983, roughly 1.6 million are in
 school. This commitment to mass education reflects the Tunisian
 government's belief that economic development can only be brought
 about through education. Adult literacy in 1975 was 51 percent
 for males and 24.8 percent for females, and 50.5 percent in urban
 areas and 24.6 percent in rural areas. Participation by women in
 the work force is increasing, rising from 6.1 percent in 1966 to
 20.1 percent in 1980, indicating considerable change in the
 country's social and cultural attitudes regarding the role of
 women. Life expectancy at birth was 60.16 years in 1980, and
 infant mortality 91.7 per thousand. Population growth stands at
 2.6 percent, and the government has an active program of family
 planning and birth control. The percentage of population with
 access to safe water in 1976 was 63 percent for urban areas and
 77 percent in rural areas. Calorie supply as a percent of
 requirements in 1977 was 115 percent.
 Legal equality between men and women is vigorously supported by
 the Tunisian Government. Equal rights in the areas of divorce
 and child custody are, for example, guaranteed by legislation.
 Women are beginning to participate in top government positions,
 as indicated by the appointment of two Women to ministerial rank
 in 1983. Despite the efforts of the Tunisian Government,
 however, traditional practices in many cases keep women,
 especially in the rural areas, from the full attainment of their
 legal rights.
