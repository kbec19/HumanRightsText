 SOLOMON ISLANDS
 Solomon Islands is an archipelago country, comprising 6 large
 islands and many smaller ones, stretching over 840 miles in
 the South Pacific. Its total population of about 280,000
 makes it the second largest (after Papua New Guinea) of the
 Melanesian countries. The Government is based on a modified
 Westminster parliamentary system consisting of a single-
 chamber legislative assembly of 38 members. This system,
 adopted when the country became independent in 1978, accords
 well both with Solomon Islands' experience and with the
 Melanesian tradition of leadership based upon individual
 achievement and political consensus. Political legitimacy
 thus rests on free popular voting. The police are under
 civilian control; there are no other armed forces. The courts
 are independent and vigorously protect individual rights.
 Since independence, two parliamentary elections have been held
 and two additional changes of government were accomplished by
 vote of Parliament.
 Since 1984 GDP has dropped 16 percent, primarily because of
 population growth of around 3.5 percent yearly and a stagnant
 economy. Severely depressed world prices for copra and a
 disastrous cyclone in 1986 were major adverse factors for the
 economy, as foreign exchange earnings are mainly dependent on
 agricultural exports.
 Human rights in Solomon Islands are protected rigorously. No
 abuses were reported in 1986.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Political killing does not occur in Solomon Islands.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no reports of political disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is neither practiced nor condoned. All the basic
 protections of the integrity of the individual are guaranteed
 by the Constitution, implemented by the authorities, and
 defended by the courts and the Ombudsman for protection
 against possible excessive or unlawful treatment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There is no evidence of politically motivated arrests. Exile
 is not practiced. Forced labor is forbidden, except as part
 of a sentence or court order.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Accused persons are entitled to counsel. Provision is made
 for writs of habeas corpus under the law and coerced
 statements are illegal. Violations of civil liberties are
 punishable by fines and jail sentences.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In addition to legal guarantees, the traditional culture
 governing the daily lives of most Solomon Islanders provides
 strong protection against these types of abuses.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Constitutional guarantees, an independent press, and a
 functioning democratic political system combine to insure
 freedom of speech and press. There are two private weekly
 newspapers, weekly and monthly national government
 newsletters, and one provincial government weekly. The
 state-owned radio gives significant coverage to statements of
 opposition politicians. In 1984 some foreign journalists were
 denied permission to cover the Pope's visit and elections.
 Since the Government of Sir Peter Kenilorea came to power in
 late 1984, however, there have been no restrictions on foreign
 press activity.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of association is constitutionally guaranteed and
 freely exercised. Demonstrators, however, must obtain a
 permit, which is usually granted.
 Unions have the right to engage in collective bargaining and
 in the private sector they have the right to strike. While
 civil servants are not supposed to strike, in September 1985
 civil servants did so, effectively closing the ports and
 airport to protest alleged corruption in the Government
 Housing Committee. The strike ended when the Government
 dissolved the Committee.
 The largest trade union, the Solomon Islands National Union of
 Workers, and other smaller unions freely organize workers.
 The plantation sector, however, is not widely unionized.
 Solomon Islands' unions have international ties with several
 organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed by law; there are no
 controls on the practice of religion and no religious
 discrimination. Although Christianity is the dominant
 religion and has a wide variety of denominations, indigenous
 beliefs also flourish. Missionaries work without restrictions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no legal or administrative restrictions on the
 freedom of movement of Solomon Islands' citizens within or out
 of the country. Natural-born citizens may not be deprived of
 citizenship on any grounds.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Since independence, Solomon Islands has had two parliamentary
 elections and several elections for provincial and local
 councils. The second of the two parliamentary elections, held

 SOLOMON ISLANDS
 in November 1984, resulted in the orderly replacement of
 Former Prime Minister Mamaloni by Sir Peter Kenilorea, who, in
 secret balloting by the Parliament, received 21 out of a
 possible 33 votes. Election results were contested in some
 constituencies and court decisions resulted in new polls in a
 few instances. The Kenilorea Government narrowly survived a
 vote of no confidence in July 1986, but fell in November 1986
 when members of its coalition Cabinet resigned. Citizens over
 18 enjoy universal suffrage.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no allegations by outside organizations of human
 rights violations in Solomon Islands nor any request for
 investigations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination based on regional or ethnic considerations is
 not practiced. The law accords women equal legal rights, but
 traditional culture, in which males are dominant and women
 seen primarily as propagators and child rearers, has hampered
 them from taking more active roles in the economic and
 political life of the country. There are no women in senior
 governmental positions or in Parliament but women are involved
 in politics and have run for national office. A shortage of
 employment and a predominantly young population with many job
 seekers are also inhibiting factors. According to a fairly
 recent survey, only 21 percent of the population aged 15-54
 was working for wages. Another 7 percent was characterized as
 self-employed, mainly as copra farmers or market gardeners,
 whose wives and family members are usually unpaid helpers.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Solomon Islands has comprehensive laws on workers' rights.
 Child labor is forbidden for children under the age of 12
 except in the company of parents in light agricultural or
 domestic work. Children under the age of 15 are barred from
 work in industry or on ships; those under 18 cannot work
 underground or in mines. The standard workweek is 45 hours
 and limited to 6 days. Power to set minimum wages has been
 devolved to the provincial governments. In Honiara, the
 capital, the minimum wage is about 30 cents per hour. There
 are provisions for premimum pay for overtime and holiday
 work. Both a strong labor movement and an independent
 judiciary ensure widespread enforcement of labor laws in major
 state and private enterprises. The extent to which the law is
 enforced in smaller establishments and in the subsistence
 sector is unclear. No information is available on
 occupational safety and health legislation.
