KYRGYZSTAN
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
The events of 2002 provided further evidence that the government of President
Askar Akaev had abandoned human rights commitments. It used lethal violence to
break up demonstrations, jailed the president’s political rivals and independentminded
Muslims, and attempted to dismantle media freedoms.With its increasingly
close relationship to the U.S. and heightened international profile, the
government appeared confident that repressive measures would have no diplomatic
consequence.
At least five demonstrators were killed and some ninety people injured, including forty-seven police officers,when violence erupted during a protest on March 17
and 18 in the Aksy district of Jalal Abad province in southern Kyrgyzstan. Protesters
demanded the release of Azimbek Beknazarov, a popular member of parliament.
(See also below.) According to eyewitnesses, police and security forces
opened fire on an unarmed crowd of hundreds to halt the demonstration,without
first allowing sufficient time for those gathered to disperse. The Ministry of Internal
Affairs claimed that demonstrators initiated the violence by throwing stones,
and originally said that no charges would be brought against the officers. The use
of live ammunition on unarmed civilians was explained as being due to a lack of
supply of rubber bullets.
Parliament introduced a bill that would amnesty those responsible for the violence
in Aksy, including officers who opened fire on demonstrators. In August,
Akaev sent the bill back to parliament for revision. Following domestic and international
pressure for accountability, a case was eventually opened. The trial of six
police officers and local administrators accused of abuse of power for their role in
the March Aksy incident began September 30 but was postponed the same day.Relatives
and supporters of the policemen staged large-scale protest rallies demanding
the defendants’ acquittal and that the court instead try the officials who gave the
order to fire on the protesters.The hearing was repeatedly delayed until October 22,
when a judge remanded the case for further investigation.
High-level government officials who supervised the forces—including the minister
of internal affairs and the National Security Service (SNB) chief—were promoted
to posts in the presidential administration following the shootings.
Persecution of Akaev’s political rivals continued. As of November, the government
failed to release Feliks Kulov, former vice-president of Kyrgyzstan who was
excluded from running against Akaev in the 2000 elections.He had been sentenced
in 2001 to seven years in prison on politically motivated charges of abuse of office.
In May 2002 he was convicted on additional charges of embezzlement and his sentence
increased to ten years. On October 11, an appeals court in Bishkek upheld the
sentence.Kulov’s imprisonment continued to generate public outrage and international
protest in 2002, as did the arrest in January 2002 of Azimbek Beknazarov.The
charges against Beknazarov stemmed from his alleged failure to investigate a murder
in 1995, when he worked as a prosecutor in Jalal Abad province. Opposition
activists believed his arrest was motivated by the government’s interest in silencing
Beknazarov’s criticism of the decision to cede to China land that had been the subject
of contention between the two states for years.
After the demonstrations in Jalal Abad province, Beknazarov was released from
custody and, on May 24, a court handed down a one-year suspended sentence and
stripped him of his seat in parliament. In June, an appeals court upheld the conviction
but annulled the sentence, restoring his parliamentary mandate. Upon his
release, Beknazarov reportedly stated that police had beaten him in custody and
that his earlier denial of ill-treatment on national television had been coerced by
security officials.
Police forcibly dispersed numerous protests in the capital,Bishkek, and detained
peaceful demonstrators, including rights defenders and journalists observing the
gatherings.Dozens of protestors were given short jail terms or forced to pay fines.
In a strike against media freedoms, in January Akaev issued Decree 20,which set
out a series of bureaucratic obstacles to independent press and publishing. It was
annulled on May 27, after an international outcry.While it was in effect, the decree
required that all printing equipment, broadly defined to include even copy
machines, be registered with the state and strictly monitored by state agencies.
The Kyrgyz government continued to make use of criminal libel laws and other
politically motivated criminal charges to punish journalists for criticism of government
policies or officials. In June, the Supreme Court upheld a 2001 verdict sentencing
television journalist Samagan Orozaliev and his driver to nine and eight
years in prison respectively on hotly contested charges of extortion and illegal
weapons possession. Orozaliev had been investigating local corruption for a documentary
film at the time of his arrest in 2001.
In May 2002 authorities also briefly detained Zharkyn Temerbaeva, a reporter
for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) just prior to a planned protest she
had come to observe. According to a report by PEN International, government
authorities opened a criminal case against poet Asanbai Jusupbekov on February
21 for “spreading false information” for informing RFE/RL, after visiting Azimbek
Beknazarov in detention, that the latter had been beaten in custody. PEN reported
that Jusupbekov had gone into hiding.
The government intensified efforts to eliminate Muslim groups whose religious
practices fell outside narrow state controls.Decree 20 appeared to be aimed also at
restricting the exchange of information by members of such groups. The decree’s
preamble stated that it was intended “to prevent subversive ideological and propagandizing
activities by various extremist religious centers and [to prevent] . . . their
informational impact . . . .” To this end, the decree called on certain state agencies
to regulate the number of religious groups and to counter the “unlawful activities
of various religious movements.”
Police arrested and harassed dozens of independent Muslims, targeting in particular
members of Hizb ut-Tahrir (Party of Liberation), a non-violent Islamic
group that seeks to establish a Caliphate, or Islamic state, in Central Asia. The
majority were charged under legal provisions prohibiting incitement of racial, ethnic
or religious enmity and sentenced to several years in prison. On July 4,Abdulla
Abduraulov and Shakat Islambaev, who had been detained for distributing Hizb
ut-Tahrir leaflets in Osh province,were convicted on such charges and sentenced to
five years in prison.
Authorities also conducted numerous search-and-seizure operations, during
which they confiscated the group’s books, brochures and leaflets, and audio- and
videocassettes.During one search in early February in Osh province,police claimed
to find a cache of weapons in the home of a Hizb ut-Tahrir member Adkham
Baltabaev, who was later released and fined 10,000 som (U.S.$208). The weapons
possession charge was presumably dropped.
In early September SNB chief Kalyk Imankulov made several unfounded statements
attempting to link the Jalal Abad protests to the work of Hizb ut-Tahrir
activists and accused the organization of destabilizing the country.He also claimed
that the SNB had recently prevented a series of “terrorist acts” by confiscating a
cache of weapons it allegedly found in a “hiding place” along with Hizb ut-Tahrir leaflets. There were no known cases under investigation on these charges as of
October 2002.
The government of Kyrgyzstan also continued to pursue its relentless campaign
against the country’s Uighur minority. Uighur activists and local rights groups
accused the Kyrgyz government of conducting a baseless smear campaign to brand
Uighurs “terrorists” and “extremists.”
In past years, Kyrgyz authorities charged several groups of Uighur men with
responsibility for violent acts, including a 1998 bus bombing. In an unusual twist,
in late 2001 Kyrgyz authorities charged that an Uzbek man was in league with
Uighur separatists when he allegedly shot to death a businessman prominent in
Kyrgyzstan’s Uighur community. The Uzbek, Otabek Akhadov, was sentenced to
death and three other men were sentenced to prison terms in what rights groups
believed was a politically motivated case. In May 2002, two citizens of China were
arrested for the same crime and handed over to Chinese authorities for prosecution
in China.
Uighur separatists were initially blamed for the shooting deaths of an official
from the Chinese embassy in Bishkek and his driver in June. At least one Uighur
with Kyrgyz citizenship was briefly detained following the incident. In July, Kyrgyz
authorities arrested and charged two Uighur men with the crime, but said they
found it was in fact not political but the consequence of a commercial dispute.
The government of Kyrgyzstan took some steps to counter the trafficking of
humans abroad. A government council on trafficking met for the first time in July.
However, local press reports indicated that trafficking and specifically the use of
companies registered in Kyrgyzstan as fronts for trafficking remained serious problems
in 2002.
Following a June 2001 decree on mine clearance and mine awareness, the Kyrgyz
Ministry of Emergency Situations began conducting mine awareness programs
among high-risk populations in affected areas.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
State agents took an aggressive stance against rights defenders, subjecting them
to harassment, intimidating surveillance, and arbitrary arrest and detention.
In January 2002, police searched the home of Bakhodir Akhmedov, deputy
director of the Committee for the Rights of Muslims, and arrested him on charges
that he had sixteen bullets in his oven. Akhmedov’s work, based in Jalal Abad
province, focused primarily on defense of ethnic Uzbeks and non-violent independent-
minded Muslims, a particularly unpopular group in Kyrgyzstan’s current
political climate. In the months that followed his arrest, as the government intensified
its campaign to arrest members of such groups, the charges against Akhmedov
became increasingly outrageous. According to Russian rights group Memorial, in
August, when state prosecutors were faced with a deadline to file charges against
Akhmedov, they charged him with membership in the Islamic Movement of
Uzbekistan, a militant group that had invaded Kyrgyz and Uzbek territory in years
past.Akhmedov’s lawyer reported that the only support for the new allegations was the testimony of ex-convicts from Uzbekistan. As of this writing, Akhmedov
remained in custody awaiting trial.
Tursunbek Akunov, chair of the Human Rights Movement of Kyrgyzstan, was
reportedly a particular target of police harassment during the Aksy protests in
March, when police grabbed him from the crowd of demonstrators. Shortly after
the shootings, the minister of internal affairs publicly blamed Akunov for the
deaths of protestors.
Police again detained Akunov when they broke up a May 2002 protest outside
parliament. Other defenders detained in that incident included Ramazan Dyryldaev,
chair of the Kyrgyz Committee for Human Rights (KCHR), and Alexander
Fomenko, Mamasadyk Jakyshev, and Kachkyn Bulatov, also of the KCHR. Dyryldaev
also reported in September that he was under intensive and intimidating surveillance
by authorities.
Among seven civilians charged in relation to the holding of the Aksy demonstrations
was Kadyrkul Omurbekov,who had been working to defend the rights of
victims and their relatives. After twelve days in custody, Omurbekov was released
on September 19, pursuant to a government agreement to drop all charges against
the demonstrators and their advocates.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
Several Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) seminars
and conferences took place in Bishkek. A conference on freedom of belief and
expression held February 15-16 focused on the need for greater dialogue between
authorities and religious confessions in Central Asia, and for interfaith tolerance as
a means to maintain stability.
OSCE leaders played a positive role by advocating increased dialogue between
the Kyrgyz government and political opposition.During his visit to the country in
May, Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) Director
Ambassador Gérard Stoudmann called on the Kyrgyz leadership to promote tolerance
and build public confidence. The OSCE chairman-in-office also traveled to
Kyrgyzstan in July for talks with President Akaev as well as meetings with civil society
groups, including independent media outlets, human rights groups, and the
leaders of opposition parties.
European Union
The E.U.-Kyrgyzstan Cooperation Council met in July to discuss implementation
of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA).An E.U. statement following
the meeting did not indicate whether the E.U. had directly challenged
Kyrgyzstan on its rights record. It noted only that respect for human rights was a
necessary condition for cooperation and that freedom of expression was among the
factors of democracy, and “took note of the measures taken by the Government of
Kyrgyzstan in the wake of the events in Aksy.”
United States
The U.S.-Kyrgyz relationship changed significantly in late 2001 and 2002 as Kyrgyzstan
agreed to host about one thousand U.S. troops—along with one thousand
troops from other countries—at Manas airbase to facilitate military operations in
Afghanistan.Now an important U.S. ally,Kyrgyzstan reportedly received U.S.$49.9
million in assistance in 2002, including $12 million for security programs, none of
it tied to progress on human rights.The U.S. continued to provide Kyrgyzstan with
non-lethal equipment and military training, and as the year progressed, security
concerns dominated its relationship with Kyrgyzstan.
At the same time, U.S. policy-makers criticized Kyrgyzstan’s backsliding on
human rights, calling it, in the words of U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
Lynn Pascoe, a country that “retreated from its early promise.” When President
Akaev visited Washington,U.S.officials reportedly told him privately that his cooperation
against terrorism did not give him a green light to undermine democracy.
The joint statement issued at the close of Akaev’s visit said that the two countries
“reaffirm”their “mutual commitment”to promote human rights.At the same time,
the U.S. failed to insist that Kyrgyzstan show tangible progress, such as the release
of Feliks Kulov, prior to the visit, and reportedly failed to ask for specific human
rights improvements during meetings between Akaev and President George W.
Bush.
The United States also provided funds for the establishment of a printing press
in Kyrgyzstan designed to help the country’s independent media resist government
harassment. As of November, however, the Kyrgyz government had refused to
authorize the printing press.
China
Kyrgyzstan’s relations with China deeply affected the domestic political situation.
In particular, the Kyrgyz government’s controversial decision to cede a three
hundred-square-mile strip of land to China sparked objection from parliamentarians
and became a focal issue for mass protests across the country.China’s influence
with Kyrgyz authorities was particularly apparent in the Kyrgyz government’s policy
toward Uighurs. China reportedly encouraged Kyrgyz officials to use a firm
hand with the Uighur minority and to pursue a series of arrests to quash any manifestation
of Uighur separatism or ambitions for self-determination in China’s Xinjiang
province.
China and Kyrgyzstan undertook counter-terrorism training exercises along
their border on October 1 under the auspices of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization
(the joint security group previously known as the Shanghai Five).
