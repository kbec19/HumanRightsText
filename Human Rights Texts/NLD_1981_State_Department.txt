 THE NETHERLANDS
 The Netherlands is a parliamentary democracy under a
 constitutional monarchy. Its political system is designed to
 allow the maximum expression of diversity of opinion consistent
 with public order. Its socio-economic system is structured to
 provide a relatively high level of health and educational
 benefits and to redistribute national income significantly.
 The Dutch observance of internationally recognized human rights
 is based on deep-seated and widely shared concepts of human
 dignity and respect for law. The Netherlands has a long and
 consistent tradition of respect for human rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom
 from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law (penal code of 1884,
 paragraph 300, as amended) and respected in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment'or
 .punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 c. Disappearances
 Prison conditions are adequate, and no differentiation in
 treatment of prisoners is made by type of conviction, social
 class, race, sex or religion. Summary executions, abductions,
 secret arrests and clandestine detention by police or other
 official security forces do not occur in the Netherlands.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment is guaranteed by
 law and respected in practice. No persons presently are
 detained in disregard of established principles. The
 equivalent of the right of habeas corpus exists in practice.
 Except in time of national emergency, preventive detention is
 n?%.permittedl normally a suspect can be held without charge no
 more than six hours.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Defendants have the right to effective
 counsel. Formal charges must be filed within six hours of
 arrest, and charges must be formally and clearly stated. The
 judiciary is independent of the executive and the military.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. A formal search warrant issued by a
 magistrate is required to enter a private residence. The
 government engages in no violations of the home.

 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These freedoms are in effect. There is no system of
 censorship. The press is privately owned and fiercely
 independent. The two television channels are government-owned
 and operated on the basis of time allocated to private
 broadcasting societies. The political opposition is alive,
 well and active; criticism of the government is frequently
 aired. No journalists have been intimidated and none has been
 imprisoned without due process. Freedom of religion is a
 centuries-old, well-established, honored and living tradition
 in the Netherlands.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration and Repatriation
 There is freedom of domestic and foreign travel, emigration and
 repatriation. Despite the fact that the Netherlands is one of
 the world's five most densely populated countries, the
 government has attempted to provide refuge for the continuing
 tide of refugees from Vietnam and other places in response to
 requests from the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees. A well-organized system of welcome, orientation and
 assistance has been set up to facilitate the integration of
 refugees into Dutch society. The Dutch traditionally have
 regarded their country as a haven for refugees, political
 dissidents and displaced persons. During the past year the
 Netherlands received nearly 2,000 refugees and dissidents,
 mostly from Vietnam but also from Africa, Latin America,
 Eastern Europe, Southwest Asia and Southeast Asia.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political life is carried out in a highly democratic fashion.
 Legislative power is vested in an assembly elected by universal
 suffrage. Women enjoy the same legal protection as men; their
 participation in the political life of the country is growing
 at an increasing rate. Some political parties have quotas for
 women candidates for public office in order to increase women's
 representation. There is an active trade union movement, with
 nearly a century of tradition, which has the legal but seldom
 exercised right to strike. The unions have a well-established
 and exercised right to organize and bargain. They also lobby
 effectively in the parliament.
 3. Government Attitude and Record regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The issue of outside investigation has not arisen with regard
 to the Netherlands. In addition to national offices of Amnesty
 International and the International Commission of Jurists,
 there are in the Netherlands approximately a dozen permanent
 organizations monitoring human rights, many of which receive
 government assistance in one form or another. The Netherlands
 government is most active in the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission and in other organs of the United Nations.

 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 The Netherlands enjoys a high per capita income (in U.S.
 dollars, 1979) -- $10,230 -- and is an affluent country. The
 government pursues policies to ensure that these benefits are
 distributed equitably throughout the economy. There is a
 relative absence of class distinction. Population growth in
 the Netherlands has been slow, averaging 0.8 percent annually
 between 1970 and 1979. The total fertility rate is 1.6
 children per family (1979). Extensive welfare programs assure
 adequate health care and shelter for those with low incomes.
 The life expectancy at birth is 75 years (1979), and the infant
 mortality rate is 10 per 1000 live births (1978). The economy.
 remains strongly capitalist, although with substantial
 intervention by the government for the purpose of
 redistributing income. A common education system serves all
 economic levels. Education is required up to age 16 and is
 free to age 18. The literacy rate in the Netherlands is 99
 percent (1976 percentage).
 There is substantial but declining discrimination against women
 in hiring, wages, work assignments and promotion, as well as in
 many other sectors of society. The government pursues equal
 rights (including special considerations for women, for
 minority groups and for the economically disadvantaged)
 through legislation and effective government procedures to
 ensure compliance. Tens of thousands of people from former
 Dutch colonies and other former colonial areas have emigrated
 to the Netherlands, where many have acquired Dutch nationality
 and thereby have become permanent members of Dutch society.
 These ethnic minorities, along with emigrant workers from
 non-Western European countries who have become temporary
 residents, face discrimination in housing, employment,
 education, public accommodations and social acceptance. These
 problems, which stem from individual attitudes and not from
 official government policy, appear to be on the increase.
 Discrimination because of race, color or religion is prohibited
 by article 429 of the Dutch penal code. The government is
 preparing a constitutional change reinforcing these
 prohibitions. In addition, there is currently before the
 parliament a draft law which would impose specific penalties
 for various forms of discrimination because of sex, sexual
 inclination or legal status in the fields of education, work
 and legal treatment.
