EAST TIMOR
East Timor made steady progress toward self-government, with full independence
scheduled for May 20, 2002.Under the auspices of the U.N.Transitional
Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), it held a peaceful election in
August for a constituent assembly whose delegates then proceeded to discuss and
debate the nature of the new state: how it would be structured, how power would be shared,what fundamental rights would be guaranteed. In September, an all-East
Timorese Council ofMinisters was appointed as the effective cabinet.The guerrilla
force, Falintil, was transformed during the year into a component of the new East
Timorese Defence Force.Policing was increasingly turned over to local graduates of
the East Timorese police academy. In October, an East Timorese replaced a Tanzanian
expatriate as general prosecutor.
The slow pace of justice continued to be a source of frustration for East Timorese
jurists, human rights advocates, and victims alike, with much of the blame
focused on UNTAET’s Serious Crimes Unit.Nevertheless, prosecutions for serious
crimes committed in 1999 did take place, with the first conviction in November
2001 of a former militia leader for crimes against humanity.
East Timorese who fled or were forcibly expelled to West Timor in 1999 began
to return home in greater numbers. In May, a fifteen-year-old East Timorese girl
was rescued and returned to East Timor from West Timor where she had been held
in sexual slavery in a militia-controlled camp. Following the August election, the
rate of return increased, with more than 3,000 people returning in October.
Although reports continued of militia leaders in the West Timor camps intimidating
refugees and spreading disinformation to discourage them from returning,
their hold over the camps seemed to be steadily declining.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
East Timor took a giant step toward independence with a widely praised election
on August 30, 2001, the second anniversary of the referendum that produced
a vote to separate from Indonesia—and devastating violence. The election for a
constituent assembly involved sixteen parties competing for eighty-eight seats.
Nearly the entire eligible voting population registered and participated, with
almost none of the political violence that had been widely predicted. Prior to the
elections, in June, the National Council of East Timorese Resistance (CNRT), the
pro-independence coalition that had dominated East Timor’s political life for the
last two years, quietly dissolved itself to make way for a more competitive political
system.
Justice for the 1999 violence in East Timor continued to be elusive. By late
November, the office of the general prosecutor in Dili, the capital, had filed thirtythree
indictments for serious crimes, four of which involved crimes against
humanity. But many of the more than seventy suspects named in the indictments
were militia members or Indonesian army officers living in Indonesia, and unlikely
to be prosecuted there, let alone extradited to East Timor.
The sentences handed down by the panel of East Timorese and international
judges in the Dili District Court reflected the seriousness of the crimes. On January
25, Joao Fernandes became the first person convicted ofmurder in connection with
the 1999 violence.He received a sentence of twelve years.(He then escaped, but was
eventually recaptured.) Augostino da Costa, who was convicted in July of killing a
local employee of the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) on August
31, 1999, received a fifteen-year prison sentence. Defendants who cooperated fully with the court and were shown to have themselves been under threat of death from
their commanders when they killed were given similarly heavy sentences.
While such terms for serious crimes would ordinarily have occasioned little
comment, some senior East Timorese officials, including Xanana Gusmao, former
resistance leader and East Timor’s president-in-waiting, questioned whether prosecuting
East Timorese served the interests of justice when the Indonesian architects
of the 1999 violence were not even indicted.
The Serious Crimes Unit’s need to clear the backlog of cases, involving longdetained
suspects, also meant that investigators and prosecutors had no time to
prepare cases against top militia commanders believed to have been responsible for
crimes against humanity—cases which should have been prepared as a top priority
when UNTAET first arrived in Dili. This meant that some commanders, such as
Cancio de Carvalho and his brother,Nemencio, could negotiate their return to East
Timor from West Timor on the understanding they would face trial, yet without
any serious prospect of prosecution.
Criticism of the Serious Crimes Unit surfaced repeatedly during the year,
notably poor administration and weakness of its senior staff, and several good
prosecutors and investigators left in frustration.
Problems also continued with the Dili court due to its lack of good interpreters,
poor or nonexistent translations of dossiers, inadequate court reporters, and inexperienced
defense counsel and other court personnel. In Baucau, East Timor’s second
largest city, the district court was briefly closed in May after assaults on a judge
and prosecutor.Court personnel complained that the U.N. police had failed to provide
adequate security in the face of threats, apparently from people unhappy with
court decisions.
On October 4, a U.S. Federal Court judge ruled in response to a lawsuit based on
the Alien Torts Claim Act that Indonesian General Johny Lumintang should pay
damages of U.S. $66 million for his role in the human rights violations committed
by the Indonesian army following the August 30, 1999, referendum in East Timor.
On October 16, during a seminar in Dili on “Justice and Accountability in East
Timor,” East Timorese nongovernmental organizations called for an international
ad hoc tribunal to be set up to prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity
in East Timor occurring after Indonesia’s 1975 invasion of the country. One week
later, on October 23, Jakarta’s chief justice of the Supreme Court promised that the
long-delayed ad hoc human rights court to try the East Timor cases would be up
and running in Jakarta by December.
In April East Timor’s provisional legislature, the National Council, approved the
establishment of a Truth, Reception, and Reconciliation. It was designed both to
facilitate the return of former militia members from West Timor and to ease the
burden on the formal judicial system by allowing those responsible for less serious
crimes, such as arson, to confess their crimes before a commission panel and receive
a punishment of community service.
There were some instances of attacks on Muslims during the year, but they were
quickly condemned by East Timorese and UNTAET officials. On January 1 and 2,
2001, stones were thrown at Muslims living in the An-Nur mosque in Dili, and on
March 7, the mosque in Baucau was destroyed.
A long-awaited labor law was finally passed by the National Council in July.
Drafted with the help of the International Labor Organization, it established a system
of labor relations in accordance with ILO standards.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
East Timor’s human rights defenders operated freely and played an active role in
lobbying UNTAET and transitional government institutions. In July, the country’s
premier human rights organization, Yayasan Hak, led an effort to challenge
UNTAET regulations that it felt compromised the independence of the judiciary in
East Timor; the regulations were changed as a result. There were no attacks on
human rights defenders. UNTAET’s Human Rights Unit provided human rights
training programs for East Timorese NGOs.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
Australia continued to play a particularly significant role in the reconstruction
of East Timor given its proximity to the new country, and Japan was the largest single
donor. East Timor in general, however, enjoyed strong support from the international
donor community.
In November 2000 and June 2001, international donor conferences were held in
Dili with the specific aim of providing assistance to the East Timorese Defence
Force. Australia was expected to provide major aid to the new force; lusophone
countries were prominently represented at the conference, including Portugal,
Angola, and Mozambique.
The E.U., U.S., Canada, and Australia were among the most active donors with
regard to supporting justice projects.
Portugal and the lusophone countries, notably Brazil, continued to provide
important assistance to East Timor, particularly in the field of education and culture.
Some three hundred students from East Timor went to Portugal for post-high
school studies, and some 150 Portuguese schoolteachers arrived in East Timor.
United Nations
The United Nations administered East Timor for a second year, and despite criticism
within East Timor of some aspects of its role there, it continued to be seen as
a major peace-keeping success story. Given the enormity of the task at hand,
UNTAET, the U.N. Security Council, the international donor community, and
above all, the East Timorese themselves deserved credit for the enormous progress
made in institution- and capacity-building. One question outstanding at the end of
the year, however, was what human rights role the United Nations would have postindependence;
it appeared by November that the Office of the High Commissioner
for Human Rights had secured agreement for a team of human rights monitors to
be assigned to East Timor after UNTAET formally comes to an end.
The Security Council continued to take an active interest in East Timor. In
November 2000, in the aftermath of the killings of three workers from the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees office in Atambua,West Timor, a Security Council
delegation visited Indonesia and East Timor. In January 2001, through resolution
1338, the Security Council voted to extend UNTAET’s mandate through
January 2002. On November 1, the Council endorsed May 20, 2002, as the date for
East Timor’s independence and agreed to keep peacekeepers, some civilian staff,
and police trainers in East Timor for up to two years after independence.
United States
In February, legislation was introduced in both houses of the U.S. Congress to
facilitate East Timor’s transition to independence through assistance for democracy
building, support for reconciliation programs, steps to enhance trade and
investment, and training of self defense forces. The bill was incorporated into the
State Department authorization legislation for fiscal year (FY) 2002; final adoption,
which was expected, was pending in late November. In the FY 2002 foreign operations
appropriations bill, the U.S. Congress renewed and strengthened human
rights conditions on International Military Education and Training (IMET) and
government military sales to Indonesia. One condition was progress on accountability
for abuses committed in East Timor.
Xanana Gusmao visited Washington, D.C. in May and met U.S. Secretary of
State Colin Powell. In August, James Kelly, U.S. assistant secretary of state for East
Asia and the Pacific, visited East Timor. He used the opportunity to criticize the
Indonesian government for its lack of progress on accountability for abuses committed
in East Timor in 1999.
European Union
The European Commission remained one of East Timor’s major donors. In
addition to providing significant humanitarian and development aid during the
year, the European Union also fielded the largest delegation of observers—thirty
members in all—for the constituent assembly elections in August.
Japan
Japan supported the creation in Indonesia of an ad hoc human rights court for
East Timor. In August and September, it sent monitors to East Timor and provided
$ 1.19 million in emergency grants to the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) to assist with monitoring and training of local election administrators in
Indonesia. In November 2001, it decided to dispatch seven hundred members of
Japan’s Self-Defense Forces to East Timor as peacekeepers, mainly for operations in
areas bordering West Timor; an assessment mission was due to visit East Timor
later in the month to finalize plans for the deployment. East Timorese NGOs
opposed the deployment on the grounds that Japan had never compensated East
Timorese victims of atrocities during World War II.
World Bank
The World Bank continued to play an instrumental role in financing development
and reconstruction projects through the Trust Fund for East Timor (TFET).
TFET is administered jointly by World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
World Bank personnel have also been active in working with East Timorese leaders
on setting benchmarks for political and economic goals, for the transition to independence
and beyond. UNDP was active in supporting programs to assist the electoral
process and to aid the administration of justice.
