UNITED KINGDOM
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in the United States, the United
Kingdom proposed emergency measures that threatened to undermine civil liberties
and the rights of refugees and migrants. Three years after the 1998 Multi-Party
Agreement was negotiated in Northern Ireland, the agreement’s human rights provisions
were not yet realized.Contentious outstanding issues included the creation
of a representative, accountable police force, and the establishment of public
inquiries into the murders of two slain defense lawyers.
On September 27, British Home Secretary David Blunkett suggested that
Afghans who might flee their country were not entitled to seek refuge elsewhere.
“There is already a major problem on the Afghan border,” he said. “The main aim
is to stop people coming from that region and spreading across the world. That is
also necessary for reasons of terrorism.”Blunkett indicated that in order to prevent
terrorism it might be necessary to curb the appeal rights of those refused entry into
the United Kingdom. Such measures threatened to prevent asylum seekers from
having their claims for refugee status assessed fully and fairly.Most individuals recognized
as refugees in the United Kingdom had appealed an initial negative decision.
In October, the British Home Office proposed new security measures—including
enhanced police powers; a denial of judicial review for decisions made by the
Special Immigration Appeals Commission,which deals with asylum claims of persons
suspected of terrorist activities; and provisions for the indefinite administrative
detention of those suspected of terrorist activity or associated with terrorist
groups or their members. In February, the United Kingdom lifted its derogation
from article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which governs the
rights of individuals in custody. The indefinite detention proposal would have
required the United Kingdom to reinstate the derogation.
On November 12, Home Secretary David Blunkett declared a “state of emergency,”
a requirement for derogation from certain provisions of the European Convention
on Human Rights (ECHR).Blunkett told the Guardian that the declaration
was a legal technicality—necessary to ensure that certain antiterrorism measures
that contravene the ECHR could be implemented—and not a response to any
imminent terrorist threat. In a statement to Parliament on October 15, Blunkett
stated that “[t]here is no immediate intelligence pointing to a specific threat to the
United Kingdom.” These public pronouncements raised concern that the United
Kingdom sought to derogate from its human rights obligations in the absence of
conditions amounting to a bona fide state of emergency.
The Home Office subsequently introduced the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and
Security 2001 bill on November 13. The bill included a definition of “international
terrorist suspects” that included persons who “have links with a person who is a
member of or belongs to an international terrorist group,” giving rise to concern
that people could be found guilty by association; provided for indefinite detention
with limited judicial review for foreigners certified by the Home Secretary as suspected
terrorists; and undermined the 1951 Refugee Convention by denying those
considered suspects the fundamental right to seek asylum and potentially excluding
them from the United Kingdom, or detaining them indefinitely without adequate
safeguards. An expedited process was implemented to see the bill to
adoption, which was expected by December.
Attacks against Muslims living in the United Kingdom increased dramatically
after September 11. On September 17, three white men beat an Afghan taxi driver
so severely that he was paralyzed from the neck down. Although such attacks were
condemned by the government—with a promise to toughen enforcement of hate
crimes legislation—new government calls for antiterrorist measures,more restrictive
immigration and asylum controls, and for halting the flow of Afghan refugees
into Europe contributed to an increasingly hostile climate toward refugees and
migrants in the United Kingdom.
The Northern Ireland peace process faced numerous challenges in 2001. On
August 18, the Irish and British governments issued a revised implementation plan
for the 1999 Patten Commission report on policing. Although Northern Ireland’s
Irish nationalist Social Democratic Leadership Party (SDLP) agreed to the plan, the
republican party Sinn Fein refused to approve it, citing its failure to incorporate key
provisions of the 1998 Patten report, which recommended fundamental reform of
policing arrangements. In September, the Northern Ireland Police Board—the
policing oversight body—was established with representatives from all the major
political parties except Sinn Fein.Without support from Sinn Fein,members of the
Catholic minority that identify themselves as republicans or nationalists were less
likely to seek jobs in the service.
In June, the Royal Ulster Constabulary introduced “less lethal” plastic bullets
into its cache of weapons.Human rights groups and Labor Party MPs argued that
scientific evidence indicated the new bullets remained lethal and continued their
calls for a total ban on the use of plastic bullets.
Children’s right to education was threatened in September in the Ardoyne area
of Belfast where local protesters—who identify themselves as Protestant “loyalists”
to the U.K.—lobbed a blast bomb, tossed bottles, and shouted sectarian slurs at
Holy Cross elementary students, girls aged four to eleven, as they made their way to
school. Loyalists issued death threats against some parents. On November 11, a sixteen-
year old loyalist protester died after a pipe bomb exploded in his hand.
Catholic parents charged the RUC with failing to protect their children adequately.
In November, the RUC arrested a nationalist who was videotaping loyalist protests
outside the school.
Press outlets continued to suffer setbacks in their efforts to report on the Force
Research Unit (FRU), a unit within British Army intelligence alleged to be responsible
for a number of killings—through its agents in both loyalist paramilitary
groups and the Irish Republican Army (IRA)—including the murder by loyalist
paramilitaries of defense lawyer Patrick Finucane in 1989. On April 24, the Ministry
of Defense secured a temporary injunction against Ulster Television’s Insight series,
which was about to broadcast a program about FRU’s infiltration of former soldiers
into the IRA.The program alleged that members of the security forces and the public
died in IRA attacks that were allowed to go ahead in order to protect those
agents’ cover. A permanent injunction was served on UTV on April 26 banning the
station from broadcasting information about the ban.
In February 2001, the Irish government issued a public statement supporting
the call for an independent international public inquiry into the March 1999 murder
of human rights lawyer Rosemary Nelson. In August 1 proposals to advance the
political process, the British and Irish governments called for the appointment of
an international judge to investigate allegations of official collusion in several cases,
including the murders of Rosemary Nelson and Patrick Finucane. The Nelson
and Finucane families continued to call for independent public inquiries into the
murders.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
In July 2000 human rights activists discovered a web site listing names of persons
being targeted by loyalist paramilitaries, including defense lawyers, journalists,
and community activists. The police got the list off the web in December 2000.
Evidence subsequently came to light that loyalists had the list and were amending
it. The RUC warned hundreds of people that their names were on the list.
On September 28, journalist Martin O’Hagan, who wrote about alleged collusion
between the security forces and loyalist paramilitaries, was shot dead in
Lurgan.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
In April, the U.N. special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers
and the special rapporteur on human rights defenders called for public inquiries
into the murders of Rosemary Nelson and Patrick Finucane.
In November, the U.N. Human Rights Committee issued concluding observations
on the United Kingdom’s fifth periodic report. The committee welcomed the
entry into force of the Human Rights Act 1998 and the establishment of a police
ombudsman and human rights commission in Northern Ireland. It recommended
that any derogation from the International Covenant on Civil and Political Righs
(ICCPR) in the effort to combat terrorism comply with the requirements on derogation
contained in article 4, to implement “a full, transparent, and credible
accounting” of the circumstances into disputed killings in Northern Ireland,
including the murders of Patrick Finucane and Rosemary Nelson, to examine the
asylum system to ensure that asylum seekers’ rights under the ICCPR receive full
protection, and to establish a national human rights commission.
Council of Europe
In four judgments issued in May, the European Court of Human Rights held
that the United Kingdom had failed to conduct effective investigations into disputed
killings in Northern Ireland.The cases were brought by the families of eleven
people killed by security forces and one person killed by Loyalist paramilitaries
with the alleged collusion of the security forces. The court unanimously found in
all four cases that the procedures for investigating the use of lethal force by police
officers failed to meet the requirements of article 2 of the European Convention on
Human Rights, which guarantees the right to life.
United States
On March 15, the second anniversary of Rosemary Nelson’s murder, the House Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights held a hearing on
the review of the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland.
The U.S. State Department’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2000
adequately catalogued the concerns of human rights groups, including the lethal
potential of plastic bullets, alleged collusion between security forces and loyalist
paramilitaries, and the unresolved murders of lawyers Rosemary Nelson and
Patrick Finucane.
