 SAO TOME & PRINCIPE*
 Sao Tome and Principe has been a one-party state since gaining
 independence from Portugal in July 1975. Effective political
 power is concentrated in the Presidency and the party, the
 Movement for the Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe. The
 country is composed of two small islands off the west coast of
 Africa with a total population of about 105,000. At
 independence, Manuel Pinto Da Costa, the leader of the
 political party, was chosen President without opposition by the
 party and the Popular Assembly, constitutionally the supreme
 organ of State and highest legislative body. The party
 reconfirmed him for,a third 5-year term in September 1985.
 No political opposition is permitted outside the party. Small
 opposition groups in exile in Portugal and Gabon have thus far
 shown no evidence of being able to influence events on the
 islands. There is no known organized political opposition in
 Sao Tome itself. There are a few Soviet and Cuban military
 advisors, and the small Sao Tomean army is reinforced by troops
 from Angola.
 In the past the Government drew heavily on Marxist-Leninist
 principles, stressing state control of the means of
 production. With a deteriorating economic situation, state
 control was reduced in 1984-85, and the private sector was
 strengthened.* The steady decline in cocoa exports, which
 account for 90 percent of Sao Tome's exports, reflected both
 lower world prices and serious management problems on the
 nationalized plantations. Lack of adequate rain since 1983 has
 further reduced all agricultural crops, resulting in serious
 food shortages and the need for food assistance from the United
 States and other Western countries.
 There was no known change in the overall human rights situation
 in 1985. Freedoms of speech, press, and assembly are
 circumscribed, but some public criticism of government policies
 is permitted. All news media are under government control.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings in 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance in 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment.
 No reports of such abuses were received in 1985.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Eight Sao Tomeans were arrested in 1984 and detained without
 trial because of public criticism of the Government. These

 human rights situation is therefore limited.

 SAO TOME & PRINCIPE
 included persons detained for expressing open dissatisfaction
 with the Government's handling of the food situation. These
 detainees may have been released. Also, in late 1984, the
 appearance of antigovernment tracts in Sao Tome led to the
 cancellation of a number of exit permits and reported
 imprisonment of those persons held responsible. However, there
 have been no recent reports of people being detained.
 There have been no reports of the use of forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution does not address the right to a public trial,
 but there have been instances of public trials of persons
 accused of common crimes in recent years. Criminal trials are
 occasionally reported by the local media. In most cases,
 however, common criminals are given a hearing and sentenced by
 a judge. To date the only political prisoners given trials
 were those accused of coup-plotting in 1977. In those trials
 and in criminal trials since that time, the accused were
 assigned counsel by the Government. There is no tradition of
 independent defense counsel. Common criminals are given a
 hearing and sentenced by a judge.
 As of the end of 1985, the Government claimed that it held no
 political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Because of Sao Tome's geographic isolation and its small
 population, the Government does not have a highly intrusive
 security system to detect opposition opinion. However, the
 Government's loosely organized system of informers, and its
 monitoring of political activities ensure that potential
 dissidents are identified.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The security services are alert and react quickly to public
 expressions of opposition or dissatisfaction with the
 Government. All Sao Tomean media are government organs and
 consist of one television station which broadcasts 2 days per
 week; a radio station which carries music, government news
 releases, and instructional programs; and a weekly two-to-four
 page newspaper of government news releases. No public written
 criticism of the Government seems to be tolerated, but oral
 criticism at party-sponsored meetings exists. The only foreign
 wire service items are occasional items from Soviet and Angolan
 sources. Voice of America Portuguese language programs reach
 Sao Tome and are listened to without interference. Sao Tome
 Radio also uses VOA taped music programs.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political assembly and activity are legal only within the
 country's sole political party, the Movement for the Liberation
 of Sao Tome and Principe. Cultural and social organizations
 require government approval, which is believed to be easily
 obtained.
 In the past, the sole trade union, which was affiliated with
 the party, existed mainly on paper. Recent efforts have been
 
 
 260
 SAO TOME & PRINCIPE
 .undertaken to organize a new union, which will be theoretically
 independent of the Government, but the Minister of Justice is
 spearheading this organizing effort, and the rights of this new
 union to bargain collectively are as yet undetermined. Its
 plans for international affiliations are also not yet known.
 There is no explicit legislation forbidding strikes, but no
 strikes have taken place in recent years.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religious freedom is guaranteed by the Constitution. The three
 religious communities--Roman Catholic, Evangelical Protestant,
 and Seventh-Day Adventist--are allowed to practice freely. The
 Government provides some funding for a school and a social
 services center managed by the Catholic Church.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The geographic isolation and poverty of the country severely
 limit foreign travel and emigration. In addition the
 Government closely controls exit visas for the few people who
 do travel. Almost all trips outside the islands are for
 governmental missions or medical evacuation. Domestic travel
 is not controlled by the Government, and people move freely on
 the islands of Sao Tome and Principe. The lack of reliable and
 affordable air service severely limits interisland travel.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Government policy is determined by President Da Costa, in
 consultation with his key cabinet and security officials. The
 leadership uses the single political party to consolidate its
 rule at the local levels and to assist in selecting candidates
 for the Popular Assembly. In the 1985 elections to the Popular
 Assembly, persons at local levels were allowed, even
 encouraged, to speak out and to give their opinions on various
 government policies. In many districts, the voters rejected
 the official party candidate in favor of another candidate.
 There are small exile groups in Portugal and Gabon. Internal
 security is reinforced by Angolan troops.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 The extent to which the Government is cognizant of or
 influenced by international human rights organizations is not
 known. Amnesty International did not have an entry on Sao Tome
 in its 1985 Report. Several persons cited by Amnesty
 International in its 1984 Report have been released, including
 Albertino Neto, the former Chief of the Armed Forces, who was
 imprisoned from 1977 until July 1983, when he was one of nine
 detainees who were amnestied. Freedom House rated Sao Tome
 "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Sao Tome's population of 105,000 is growing at the rate of 2
 percent annually. The country's per capita gross domestic
 product, which had been estimated as high as $450 in the late
 1970's, is believed'to have dropped to about $364 by 1983 as a
 result of the steady deterioration of the economy, due largely
 to the decline in value and volume of cocoa exports.
 
 
 261
 SAO TOME & PRINCIPE
 The country is dependent on imported foodstuffs for a varied
 diet, and the lack of foreign exchange in recent years has
 caused shortages of many staple foods and consumer products.
 Malnutrition was emerging as a problem, but large amounts of
 international food assistance sent to Sao Tome in 1984 have
 alleviated the situation.
 The Government has made a major effort to improve social and
 educational services reportedly including free basic medical
 care. In 1985, life expectancy at birth was 66 years, and
 infant mortality was 64 per 1,000 live births. Approximately
 80 percent of the population has access to potable water.
 Adult literacy is about 43 percent. The primary school
 enrollment ratio for 1982 was 111 percent, (male children 112
 percent and female 108 percent). There is also an active adult
 evening education program.
 Legislation requires that a minimum wage of approximately $65
 per month be paid to workers. A legal minimum employment age
 of 18 years is apparently observed in practice. Basic
 occupational health and safety standards are established in the
 Social Security Law of 1979. Members of the island's small
 educated class appear to enjoy advantages in government
 employment possibilities.
 Women have constitutional guarantees of equality, and several
 are active in public life. One senior official, the Minister
 of Education and Culture, is a woman, as is the President of
 the Popular Assembly. There are at least two female members of
 the central committee of the party. Cultural factors, rather
 than legal or political restraints, limit the actual
 participation of women in government.
 The Sao Tome population is relatively homogeneous, and there
 have been no reports of policy discrimination on a tribal,
 regional, sexual, or religious basis among Sao Tomean
 citizens. As energetic outsiders, Cape Verdeans in Sao Tome do
 suffer some informal discrimination.
