INDIA
In 2002, India witnessed its worst episode of communal violence in over a
decade, demonstrating the increasingly volatile consequences of a broad and
government-supported Hindu nationalist agenda in the country. In February and
March state-supported anti-Muslim violence in the northwestern state of Gujarat
claimed at least two thousand lives. As in Gujarat, attacks against historically discriminated
groups in other parts of the country, including Christians, Dalits (or socalled
untouchables), and tribals, were carried out with virtual impunity. Attacks
by militants continued to claim many civilian lives in the disputed region of Kashmir
and in the northeast.
The conflict in Kashmir persisted throughout 2002, as the safety of civilians and
political leaders came under regular attack by militant groups. Hundreds were
killed during, and in the weeks preceding, state assembly elections in September
and October. Moreover, heightened tensions between India and Pakistan once
again raised concerns of armed conflict, especially as both countries rapidly
deployed troops and refused diplomatic negotiation. Elections in Kashmir offered
some hope for a resolution to the crisis in the state.The new coalition government’s
action plan included a commitment to investigate allegations of human rights violations by Indian security forces, and a proposal to urge Delhi to hold peace talks
with Kashmiri groups.
The controversial passage of the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act raised
concerns that, like its predecessor, the act would be used to target political opponents
and minorities in the name of the war against terrorism. HIV/AIDS continued
to spread rapidly around the country, while efforts by nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs) to promote education and awareness were stymied by
extensive police harassment and abuse of outreach workers.
The United Nations increasingly recognized caste-based discrimination as a
violation of international law, calling for states parties to adopt legislative and constitutional
measures that would protect and uplift affected communities.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
On February 27, in the town of Godhra in Gujarat, a Muslim mob attacked a
train on which Hindu activists were traveling. The activists were returning from
Ayodhya, a town in Uttar Pradesh where they had supported the Vishwa Hindu
Party (World Hindu Council,VHP) campaign to build a Hindu temple on the same
site where Hindu militants had destroyed a mosque in 1992.Two train cars were set
on fire, killing at least fifty-eight people. In July, results of an official investigation
by the Ahmedabad-based Forensic Science Laboratory stated that the fire could not
have been set by the mob from the outside as had been alleged; the fire, it claimed,
was set from inside the train. Investigations into the attack were ongoing at this
writing.
The Godhra massacre was immediately followed by a four-day retaliatory killing
spree, in which over two thousand people, mostly Muslim, fell victim to mobs that
looted and burned their homes, destroyed places of worship and Muslim-owned
businesses, and gang-raped and sexually mutilated Muslim women and girls. In
some cases, pregnant women’s bellies were cut open and fetuses were pulled out
before the women were killed. In addition to the children who were direct victims
of the mobs, children were witnesses to horrifying violations and deaths of family
members.
Human Rights Watch’s investigations, and those of Indian human rights groups,
revealed that much of the violence was planned well in advance of the Godhra
attack and was carried out with state approval and orchestration.Gujarat is headed
by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a Hindu nationalist party that also heads a
coalition government at the center. State officials and the police were directly
involved in the violence: In many cases, the police led the charge, using gunfire to
kill Muslims who got in the mobs’ way. The groups most directly responsible for
this violence against Muslims included the VHP, the Bajrang Dal (the militant
youth wing of the VHP), and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (National Volunteer
Corps, RSS), collectively forming the sangh parivar (or “family” of Hindu
nationalist groups).
Mobs arrived by the thousands in trucks, chanting slogans of incitement to kill,
and armed with swords, tridents, sophisticated explosives, and gas cylinders. They were guided by computer printouts listing the addresses of Muslim families and
their properties.While army troops had been flown in to quell the violence, state
officials refused to deploy them until after the worst violence had ended. In the
weeks that followed the massacres, Hindu homes and places of business were also
destroyed in retaliatory violence by Muslims.
In the aftermath of the violence, authorities embarked upon a cover-up of their
own role, and that of the sangh parivar, in the attacks against Muslims. While
numerous police reports filed by eyewitnesses specifically named local VHP, BJP,
and Bajrang Dal leaders as instigators or participants in the violence, the police,
reportedly under instructions from government officials, faced pressure not to
arrest them, or to reduce the severity of the charges filed. Top police officials who
had sought to protect Muslims were removed from positions of command.
Gujarat’s Chief Minister Narendra Modi, formerly a RSS volunteer and propagandist,
came under severe scrutiny for his role in the attacks.
At the time of this writing, efforts to bring perpetrators to justice were virtually
nonexistent. To the contrary, the state government appeared to have been emboldened
by the violence, calling for early Gujarat legislative assembly elections in October
that would have swept the BJP back into power, on a rising sentiment of Hindu
nationalism. The Electoral Commission, however, prohibited such a move, noting
that Gujarat was still devastated by the communal violence, and set December 12
as the election date.
The destruction, as well as enmity and insecurity left by the communal violence,
caused the forcible displacement of over one hundred thousand Muslims into over
one hundred makeshift relief camps throughout Gujarat, some located in Muslim
graveyards. The majority of these camps only remained open until June, when the
government unilaterally began to close them,forcing thousands of victims to either
enter unofficial relief camps or to return to villages where their security was continually
threatened. In October the government announced that the few remaining
camps would be disbanded by October 30. Throughout this period, the state government
failed to provide adequate and timely humanitarian assistance to the
internally displaced. Problems included serious delays in government assistance
reaching relief camps, inadequate state protection, and failure to provide medical
and food supplies and build sanitation facilities.Moreover, nongovernmental relief
workers seeking to assist victims of violence were limited by a lack of access and
protection.
On September 24, the violence began anew when gunmen stormed the Swaminarayan
Hindu temple in Gandhinagar,Gujarat, killing at least twenty-eight people
and injuring fifty-three. The Indian government responded swiftly, taking appropriate
steps to maintain law and order by deploying approximately three thousand
army personnel during a nationwide strike called by the VHP to protest the attack.
Critics of the government remarked that had it acted as quickly following the
Godhra massacre, many deaths could have been prevented. Indian officials also
called on citizens to end the cycle of violence by refraining from taking the law into
their own hands. The incident once again heightened tensions with Pakistan,
blamed by India for the attack.
The violence in Gujarat underscored the volatile consequences of rising Hindu nationalist sentiment, propagated by the sangh parivar. Training camps known as
shakhas continued to spread throughout the country, providing extensive physical
and ideological training to men as well as young boys targeted in recruitment
drives. This revivalist campaign included the “Hinduization” of education, including
the revision of history books to include hate propaganda against Islamic and
Christian communities. In September 2002 the National Council of Educational
Research and Training released new textbooks for Indian children in implementation
of a new educational framework, following the lifting of a stay by the Indian
Supreme Court. The Supreme Court had rejected public interest litigation that
argued the new framework would violate the constitutional requirement of secularism
given the introduction of “value education” into the curriculum, seen by
many as a means of injecting religious instruction into education. Connections
between the drafters of the new textbooks and Hindu nationalist organizations,
revealed only once the stay had been lifted, increased these concerns.
Member organizations of the sangh parivar also continued to distribute hate literature,
direct violent attacks, and mount conversion efforts against other minority
communities, most notably Christians and tribals. Attacks against Christians
included violence against nuns, priests, and missionaries, and the destruction of
religious sites.
On February 17, in the southern state of Karnataka, a church in the town of
Hinkal was attacked during morning mass. Seventy men, draped in the Hindu
nationalist signature saffron flags, descended on the church, armed with clubs and
hurling bricks and stones at the congregation. The police eventually arrived at the
scene, but did not protect the worshipers or immediately arrest the perpetrators
(the police later reported having arrested nine of the assailants). A similar incident
took place in the Koraput district of the eastern state of Orissa on April 29, when a
church with twenty worshippers was torched by fifty assailants.
Individuals were also the targets of religious violence. On June 5, in the western
state of Maharashtra, a pastor known for his active involvement with the Christian
Revival Center was assaulted in his home, along with his family, by a gang of sangh
parivar members who were reportedly upset with the regular Sunday worship services
in the area. The State Minority Commission subsequently ordered police protection
for the pastor, and the police were successful in apprehending the assailants.
Human Rights Watch continued to receive reports of Dalits falling victim to
caste-based violence, most often at the hands of upper castes who perpetrated these
crimes with almost complete impunity. In May three Dalits in the southern state of
Tamil Nadu were tortured by a village leader: two were branded with a hot iron rod
and forced to feed human feces to each other. The incident occurred after the three
victims publicly announced that the village president had yet to return money she
owed one of them.One of the victims was subsequently strangled and beaten by the
president’s husband and son.While the police eventually charged the perpetrators
with crimes under the Indian Penal Code and the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled
Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act (1989), Dalits complained that as a result of
the incident local upper-caste community members refused to give them work.
In September, the Center for Dalit Human Rights in Rajasthan, a northern state,
organized a two-day march, protesting community policies in the village of Chakwara that barred Dalits from using public ponds or entering village shops. An
upper-caste mob descended on the march, pelting stones and attacking both the
demonstrators and the police, injuring fifty people. The policies were put in place
in December 2001 when the village’s upper-caste community imposed a fine on
two Dalits who had used public bathing facilities.Despite lodging a complaint with
state authorities, Dalits continued to be excluded and to face threats of violence.
On October 16 in Jhajjar district, Haryana, five Dalit youths were lynched by a
mob, reportedly led by members of the VHP in the presence of local police officials,
following false rumors that the Dalits had killed a cow—an animal regarded as
sacred in the Hindu religion. Nearly a month later five people were arrested,
prompting a backlash by villagers who pelted police with stones and blocked off
roads for nearly a week. The VHP reportedly also forced shops, businesses, and
schools to close in protest of the arrests. The local leader of the VHP,Acharya Giriraj
Kishore, said he had no regrets over the incident and that the life of a cow was
worth more than that of five Dalits.
Dalit women and girls were often subject to sexual harassment and violence. For
example, on April 5 four upper-caste men abducted a fourteen-year-old Dalit girl
from her home just outside Jaipur, Rajasthan, and gang-raped her over a period of
three days. Upon her return to her village, the village’s upper-caste community
threatened to remove her family from the village if they reported the incident. On
November 3 a Dalit woman in Kishanganj, Bihar was paraded half-naked by a
group of people who wanted to teach a lesson to her family for not relinquishing
their claim to a piece of land.
The controversial Prohibition of Forcible Conversion of Religion Bill was passed
in the state of Tamil Nadu on October 31. The new law attracted widespread criticism
because it was feared it would make it more difficult for poor people, persecuted
minorities, and others ostracized under the caste system to convert from
Hinduism to another religion. Ordered by the AIADMK-ruling government of
Chief Minister Jayalalitha Jayaram, the bill found support with the federal government,
led by the BJP.
In a positive development, on May 9,Gujarat’s Allahabad High Court dismissed
a private action brought by a father against a man who had married his daughter in
an inter-caste marriage.The defendant claimed that his wife’s parents threatened to
kill him and his wife if they did not divorce.Although only reaffirming existing laws
on caste discrimination, the court’s ruling used strong language against the caste
system and such killings, and urged the police to intervene when such situations
arise.
In January, the state government of Madhya Pradesh adopted the landmark
Bhopal Declaration following a two-day conference titled “Charting a New Course
for Dalits for the 21st Century,” which was organized with the support of the
National Campaign for Dalit Human Rights. The declaration’s twenty-one point
agenda included the enforcement of living wages for agricultural laborers, the
restoration of alienated land for tribals, strict enforcement of the Bonded Labour
System (Abolition) Act (1976), honest implementation of the Scheduled Castes
and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act (1989) and Rules (1985), and
the elimination of the caste-based practice of manual scavenging. 
The Indian government continued to exploit rhetoric surrounding the global
“war against terrorism” in order to target religious minorities and political opponents.
Most notably, the long debated anti-terrorism legislation, the Prevention of
Terrorism Act (POTA), was pushed through parliament on March 26. Its close
resemblance to the much misused and now lapsed Terrorists and Disruptive Activities
(Prevention) Act (TADA) of 1985 (amended 1987) foreshadowed a return to
the widespread and systematic curtailment of civil liberties.
POTA created an overly broad definition of terrorism, while expanding the
state’s investigative and procedural powers.Moreover,under POTA, suspects can be
detained for up to three months without charge, and up to three months more with
the permission of a special judge. Since its passage, POTA has been implemented
against political opponents in various parts of the country. On July 11 in the state
of Tamil Nadu,Vaiko, a leader of the political party Marumalarchi Dravida Munetra
Kazhakam (MDMK),was arrested for making remarks in support of the banned
terrorist group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Only two weeks after
Vaiko’s arrest, P.Nedumaran, a leader of the Tamil Nationalist Movement, was also
arrested under POTA for making pro-LTTE remarks at a conference on April 13.
In Kashmir, the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) chairman, Yasin
Malik, was held under POTA on March 26, on charges of receiving smuggled
money from a Pakistan-based separatist group.Malik was released on bail for medical
reasons, but was immediately rearrested under a Jammu and Kashmir preventive
detention law, the Public Safety Act (PSA), for anti-national activity.
The former chairman of the All-Party Hurriyat Conference (APHC), Syed Ali
Geelani, suspected of funneling money to Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence, was
arrested and detained in the eastern state of Bihar following raids on his residence,
and charged under POTA and PSA on June 9.Both the JKLF and the APHC are separatist
parties that have advocated Kashmir’s independence from India, raising
concerns that the charges against their leaders were politically motivated.
Insurgency attacks and counterattacks by Indian troops continued to threaten
security and stability in the northeastern states. On August 20, twenty Indian paramilitary
soldiers were killed in an ambush in the state of Tripura. According to the
police, the ambush was carried out by the separatist group, the National Liberation
Front of Tripura (NLFT).
Civilians in the northeast also came under direct attack. On August 13, in a pre-
Independence Day attack, militants executed fifteen passengers traveling on a bus
through the state of Assam, and injured twenty other people. The strike was suspected
to be a joint attack by separatist groups, the United Liberation Front of
Assam (ULFA), the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB), and the
Achik National Volunteer Council (ANVC). Indian soldiers also participated in
violence, raiding separatist hideouts, and in some cases summarily executing separatist
leaders.
On December 13, 2001, a five-man assault team, believed to be part of Lashkare
Taiba, an Islamic guerrilla group based in Pakistan, stormed Parliament in New
Delhi, killing fourteen people. The Indian government issued a sharp rebuke,
accusing Pakistan of failing to reign in the activities of terrorist organizations.Military
deployment following the attack included the emplacement of large numbers of anti-personnel and anti-vehicle mines along the border—apparently one of the
largest mine-laying operations worldwide in many years. The Indian press cited
numerous reports of civilian casualties along the border, as well as the killing and
injuring of Indian army personnel and border security troops as they planted the
mines.
In May, three gunmen hijacked a bus, killing seven passengers, and then raided
the residential quarters of a Kashmiri army base in Kaluchak.At least eighteen civilians
were killed in the raid on the residential compound. State police identified the
gunmen as residents of Pakistan’s Punjab province. In the days that followed the
attack, both India and Pakistan fully deployed army troops along the border, and as
exchange of artillery became heavier, the countries’ conflict was escalating.
On July 13, gunmen suspected to be part of the Lashkar-e Taiba launched an
attack on a shantytown in Jammu. Disguised as Hindu holy men, the group threw
grenades at a shop in Qasim Nagar, a migrant laborer colony, and then fired on
civilians who were standing nearby. The attack killed twenty-seven civilians, and
severely injured thirty more.
On May 21, Abdul Ghani Lone, a moderate Kashmiri separatist leader, was
assassinated by unidentified assailants during a memorial rally in Srinagar, the
summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir. Lone belonged to the APHC, but was
largely perceived as a pragmatist and peace advocate.
State assembly elections were held in Jammu and Kashmir in four phases from
September 16 to October 8. The election, which was marked by widespread violence
and allegations of vote rigging, left no party with a clear majority but resulted
in a decisive defeat for the National Conference party,which had held power in the
state for most of the preceding five decades. The People’s Democratic Party (PDP)
and the Congress party together won thirty-six seats and formed a coalition government,
headed by PDP leader Mufti Mohammad Sayeed. In a hopeful move, Sayeed
announced that the government would investigate all cases of custodial killings
and human rights abuses and punish offenders.He also committed to opening dialogue
for peace and to fighting cross-border and indigenous militancy. On November
11, a week after Sayeed was sworn in as chief minister, separatist leader Yasin
Malik was released from prison—one of numerous political prisoners whose
release was ordered.
The elections sparked an escalation of violence throughout the region, carried
out by both militants and Indian security forces. Between August 2, when the elections
were announced, and September 24,when the second phase of elections came
to an end, over five hundred people were killed. State Minister Mushtaq Ahmed
Lone was assassinated on September 11 while campaigning for re-election. On September
19, gunmen stormed a high school north of Jammu, killing a teacher and a
student, while security forces and militants engaged in a series of standoffs. The
third phase of elections brought renewed and heightened violence as well. On
October 1, as polls opened, three gunmen hurled grenades at a bus in the town of
Hiranagar, killing nine people and injuring ten others, while militants launched
grenade and rocket attacks at polling stations throughout the district of Anantnag.
Despite the violence, voter turnout was significantly higher than for national elections
in 1999.
Throughout India, women continued to be victimized by rape, trafficking, sexual
harassment, and domestic violence, often with little recourse to justice.
Although the government passed the Protection from Domestic Violence Bill
(2002), women’s groups asserted that it fell short of achieving meaningful reform.
In 2002, at least fifteen million children, most of them Dalits,worked as bonded
laborers in conditions of forced servitude. Most worked in agriculture; others
picked rags, rolled beedi cigarettes, packaged firecrackers, cleaned hotels, or wove
silk saris and carpets. Human Rights Watch investigations in 2002 revealed that in
the silk industry, bonded children worked twelve or more hours a day, six-and-ahalf
or seven days a week, producing silk thread and helping weave silk handloom
fabric. Both boys and girls suffered injuries and disease from fumes, machinery,
sharp threads, boiling water, or handling dead worms, as well as verbal and physical
abuse from their owners.
Despite increased public awareness about child labor, the child labor law continued
to be poorly enforced,with high-level officials advocating nonenforcement.
Certain states, the central government, and NGOs advanced schools to rehabilitate
child workers, a positive step but one that reached only a small fraction of working
children. Although the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) continued
with some success to pressure local and state governments to enforce laws outlawing
bonded labor and certain forms of child labor, the commission’s limited
resources and power required it to focus on only a few areas and industries. Elsewhere,
caste bias, sympathy to employers, corruption, and apathy contributed to
the government’s failure to free bonded laborers, rehabilitate them, and prosecute
their owners.
In 2002, the lower house of Parliament passed the 93rd Constitutional Amendment
giving all children ages six to fourteen a fundamental right to free and compulsory
education provided by the state. The amendment also placed a
constitutional obligation on parents and guardians to provide educational opportunities
to these children. Activists strongly objected to the exclusion of children
falling outside the age range prescribed by the amendment, and to the obligation
placed on parents. At this writing, the amendment was awaiting the president’s
endorsement.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Given the absence of government-coordinated relief efforts, NGOs and community
groups assumed much of the responsibility for delivering supplies and aid
to victims in Gujarat’s relief camps and establishing rehabilitative services such as
schools, trauma counseling, and legal assistance. In doing so, they faced limited
access to the relief camps and serious threats to personal safety. Police and members
of the city administration obstructed the work of NGOs and other organizations
attempting to deliver supplies to relief camps, denying access to transport
services and refusing the use of their own trucks. Moreover, government officials
refused to provide aid workers with the security and protection that they needed to
provide assistance. The National Human Rights Commission also highlighted the need for rehabilitation and justice efforts in Gujarat, sending a team to monitor the
situation shortly after the riots and issuing a set of recommendations to the central
and state governments.
Activists battling India’s growing HIV/AIDS epidemic also met considerable
resistance to their work, which included direct attacks on their security. India is
home to one of the largest and fastest-growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world.
As the epidemic has spread, the longstanding practice of stigmatizing high-risk
groups, such as women in prostitution and men who have sex with men, assumed
deadly proportions. NGOs conducting HIV/AIDS prevention programs for highrisk
populations reported severe harassment of their workers by the police.
An example was the abuse faced by SANGRAM/VAMP, a collective of women in
prostitution. The organization suspended its anti-AIDS operations in February
when violent thugs drove its members out of their homes in Nippani, Karnataka,
with the complicity of a local police official. Before this disruption,
SANGRAM/VAMP built up a program that delivered 350,000 condoms per month.
By year end, it managed to reestablish most of this work, but harassment by the
police remained a concern for many Indian NGOs working with women in prostitution
to fight back against AIDS. In November 2002, Human Rights Watch honored
Meena Seshu, the general secretary of SANGRAM, for her work in exposing
and stemming India’s growing HIV/AIDS crisis. In Kolkata, the sex worker organization
Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee (DMSC) faced similar abuse and
intimidation.When the DMSC filed a complaint about the beating of one of their
members, local thugs publicly beat up DMSC president Swapna Gayen in the presence
of police who had been called for help. This and other instances of intimidation
led to mass demonstrations by sex workers, and the arrest of two of the
perpetrators. At this writing, however, other key perpetrators remained at large,
and abuses against sex workers in Kolkata persisted.
The situation was equally challenging for organizations seeking to assist men
who have sex with men. Police harassment of these organizations, including outreach
workers focusing on HIV/AIDS prevention, is a chronic problem, but worsened
in early 2002. After the December 2001 attack on Parliament in New Delhi,
AIDS outreach workers from Naz Foundation (India) Trust (NFIT) reported
increased police scrutiny on the streets of the capital.Groups in Chennai and Bangalore
told Human Rights Watch that various security incidents, some perhaps
related to communal violence in other parts of the country, made the police nervous
and prone to harass AIDS workers.
Men who have sex with men are not only stigmatized but are effectively criminalized
by the “unnatural offenses” provision of the Indian Penal Code (section
377) that bans sex between men. In late 2001, NFIT, with the assistance of the
Lawyers Collective ofMumbai and New Delhi, brought a petition to the Delhi High
Court for the repeal of section 377.An affirmative ruling on the petition would dramatically
improve the climate for AIDS prevention work among men who have sex
with men in India.At this writing, the case was ongoing.
Individual human rights workers also came under direct threat. On June 19
Navleen Kumar, a land rights activist who helped tribals regain their land from
builders, was fatally stabbed.Kumar had long fought for the land rights of tribals as builders expanded development efforts to the outskirts of Mumbai, and was
repeatedly threatened for her continued work. On July 8 P.B.D’Sa, vice president of
the Karnataka state branch of the People’s Union for Civil Liberties, was stabbed
and sustained serious injuries. Police personnel reportedly were involved in the
attack. This was the second attempt on D’Sa’s life; the first was in 1988. The longawaited
State Human Rights Commission was formed in Uttar Pradesh with the
governor’s approval of its five members on October 7.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
The communal violence in Gujarat and the conflict in Kashmir took center stage
in the international community’s political dealings with India. In April,British officials
in India issued a scathing internal report stating that the violence in Gujarat
was planned, possibly months in advance of the Godhra attack,with the support of
the state government. Responding to growing international scrutiny into the violence,
the Indian government stated that it “does not appreciate interference in [its]
internal affairs.”
United Nations
Despite strong international reaction to the communal violence in Gujarat, the
Indian government refused to solicit or accept the assistance of U.N. agencies, only
exacerbating already dismal conditions in relief camps. In September however, the
then U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights,Mary Robinson, issued a statement
asking the Indian government to ensure the protection of internally displaced
persons as they returned to their homes and to initiate prosecutions against those
who perpetrated the violence.
Following the momentum and mobilization that Dalit organizations achieved
at the 2001 U.N.World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia
and Related Intolerance (WCAR) in Durban, South Africa, the U.N. focused
on the issue of caste discrimination. In August, the sixty-first session of the Committee
on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) included a thematic
discussion on descent-based discrimination. The Committee recognized castebased
discrimination as a form of descent-based discrimination and strongly condemned
its practice as a direct violation of the Convention on the Elimination of
all forms of Racial Discrimination. It further recommended that states parties
adopt legislative and constitutional measures that would prohibit all forms of
descent-based discrimination while ensuring measures to achieve internationally
guaranteed rights for affected communities.
United States
The U.S. put urgent priority on high-level diplomatic efforts to lower tensions
between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell visited
India in January and July, and the U.S. took the lead in pressing other governments to intervene.Powell’s July visit to New Delhi was marred by a series of attacks
by suspected militants in Srinagar. In October senior U.S. official Richard Haas visited
the region in an effort to defuse tension and encourage India and Pakistan to
resume dialogue. However, India said a dialogue with Pakistan could only resume
when infiltration by armed separatists across the Line of Control (LoC) dividing
Kashmir stopped.
On October 10, the U.S. endorsed what it deemed the successful conclusion of
elections in Jammu and Kashmir despite violence and allegations of intimidation
and voting irregularities.The State Department applauded the efforts of the Indian
Election Commission and the courage of the candidates and the voters who participated
despite the violence and intimidation, though the U.S. condemned electionrelated
violence and voting irregularities.
In response to the Gujarat violence, the Bush administration sent a State
Department official to New Delhi in late May to meet with government officials and
the national commissions on human rights and minorities. But intensive lobbying
by members of the Indian-American community prevented introduction of a resolution
in the U.S. Congress condemning the violence. The U.S. Commission on
International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) held a hearing in June on the violence
and the U.S. response. On September 30, USCIRF recommended for the first time
that the Secretary of State designate India among the twelve “countries of particular
concern”(CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (IRFA).
IRFA requires the president to oppose egregious and systematic violations of religious
freedom by taking specified diplomatic or economic actions.
The U.S. increased its military support of India. Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld went to New Delhi in June. Congress approved the sale of military
equipment, including $140 million in radar equipment, aircraft engines and submarine
and helicopter parts. In September, India announced the purchase of
another $100 million in U.S. defense equipment, including artillery radar.Cooperation
on counter-terrorism initiatives between the U.S. and India included intelligence
sharing, training, and anti-money laundering cooperation.
European Union
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on May 16 “strongly condemning”
the communal violence in Gujarat. It also called on the central and state governments
to investigate the killings, noting the overwhelming majority of Muslim
deaths. The resolution was followed by leaks of an internal E.U. report that found
evidence of state complicity and pre-arrangement by Hindu nationalist groups.
The E.U. welcomed the completion of assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir.
While commending the efforts of the Indian Election Commission in its efforts
to promote free and fair elections, and condemning election-related violence and
the resulting loss of life, the E.U. also urged the Indian government to investigate
reports of election irregularities.
The third annual summit between the E.U. and India was held in Copenhagen,
Denmark on October 10. The resulting Agenda for Action included commitments
to further develop regular bilateral dialogue on democracy and human rights; cooperate to promote democracy, development, fundamental freedoms, and the
rule of law; and increase cooperation in counter-terrorism initiatives. India
remained the European Commission’s largest single recipient of E.U. aid in Asia.
Funding for 2002-06 was expected to total Û225 million (U.S.$219.6 million). The
commission identified poverty elimination as the guiding principle of aid activities,
with a focus on elementary education and basic health.Other funding priorities
included programs that incorporate the experience and needs of women and
other socially marginalized groups, as well as good governance programs.
Japan
Japan repeatedly urged both India and Pakistan to resume dialogue on Kashmir.
During a meeting of the Japanese and Indian foreign ministers at the ASEAN
regional forum in Brunei in August, a joint statement was issued on economic
cooperation announcing that Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi would visit India
(no date was announced). Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi also made an appeal
