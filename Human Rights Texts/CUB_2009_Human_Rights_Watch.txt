Cuba
Cuba remains the one country in Latin American that represses nearly all forms of
political dissent. The government continues to enforce political conformity using
criminal prosecutions, long- and short-term detentions, mob harassment, surveillance,
police warnings, and travel restrictions.
Since Fidel Castro relinquished direct control of the government to his brother,
Raul Castro, in August 2006—and finally stepped down in February 2008—Cuba
has at times signaled a willingness to reconsider its long-standing disregard for
human rights norms. In 2008 the country signed the two fundamental international
human rights treaties and commuted the death sentences of several prisoners.
Yet these measures have led to no significant policy changes in Cuba. The
repressive machinery built over almost five decades of Fidel Castro’s rule remains
intact and continues to systematically deny people their basic rights.
Legal and Institutional Failings
Cuba’s legal and institutional structures are at the root of rights violations.
Although in theory the different branches of government have separate areas of
authority, in practice the executive retains clear control over all levers of power.
The courts, which lack independence, undermine the right to fair trial by severely
restricting the right to a defense.
Cuba’s Criminal Code provides the legal basis for repression of dissent. Laws
criminalizing enemy propaganda, the spreading of “unauthorized news,” and
insult to patriotic symbols are used to restrict freedom of speech under the guise
of protecting state security. The government also imprisons or orders the surveillance
of individuals who have committed no illegal act, relying upon provisions
that penalize “dangerousness” (estado peligroso) and allow for “official warning”
(advertencia oficial).
Political Imprisonment
The Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation (CCDHRN),
a respected local human rights group, in July 2008 issued a list of 219 prisoners whom it said were incarcerated for political reasons. The list included 11 peaceful
dissidents arrested so far in 2008. Of 75 political dissidents, independent journalists,
and human rights advocates who were summarily tried and sentenced in
2003, 55 remained imprisoned as of September 2008. Four others were released
in February 2008 on health grounds, having been forced to choose between staying
in prison, where they were denied medical treatment, and being exiled to
Spain.
Family members of political prisoners are frequently harassed and blacklisted
from jobs.
Travel Restrictions and Family Separations
The Cuban government forbids the country’s citizens from leaving or returning to
Cuba without first obtaining official permission, which is often denied.
Unauthorized travel can result in criminal prosecution. In May 2008 Cuban blogger
Yoani Sanchez was awarded a Spanish journalism prize. The government initially
issued an exit visa to Sanchez, but the day before she was scheduled to
leave the visa was put on hold without explanation, and she was unable to accept
the award in person. On August 15, after repeatedly being denied exit visas, eight
dissidents tried to escape Cuba aboard a primitive boat. They have not been
heard from since and are presumed dead at sea.
The government frequently bars citizens engaged in authorized travel from taking
their children with them overseas, essentially holding the children hostage to
guarantee the parents’ return. Given the widespread fear of forced family separation,
these travel restrictions provide the Cuban government with a powerful tool
for punishing defectors and silencing critics.
The government is also clamping down on the movement of citizens within Cuba
by more aggressively enforcing a 1997 law known as Decree 217. Designed to limit
migration to Havana, the decree requires Cubans to obtain government permission
before moving to the country’s capital. According to one Cuban official, the
police have forcibly removed people from Havana in approximately 20,000
instances since 2006. In a representative case, a migrant from Granma province
who had been living in Havana for seven years was stopped in the street by a police officer and told to present her papers. When she could not produce them,
the police immediately sent her back to Granma.
Freedom of Expression and Assembly
The government maintains a media monopoly on the island, ensuring that freedom
of expression is virtually nonexistent. Although a small number of independent
journalists manage to write articles for foreign websites or publish underground
newsletters, the risks associated with these activities are considerable.
Access to information via the internet is also highly restricted. The only internet
café in Havana charges US$5 per hour—one-third of the average Cuban monthly
salary; two other cafes may be used only to send emails on a closed Cuban network.
According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 22 journalists were serving
prison terms in Cuba as of October 2008, making the country second only to
China for the number of journalists in prison. Independent journalist, Oscar
Sánchez Madan, was arrested in April 2007 after reporting on local corruption in
Matanzas. He is now serving a four-year prison sentence for “social dangerousness.”
In 2008 the Cuban government significantly increased the use of arbitrary detention
to harass and intimidate dissidents, and restrict freedom of assembly. In all
of 2007, the CCDHRN documented 325 arbitrary detentions by security forces; in
the first half of 2008 it reported 640 arbitrary detentions. The detentions are
often used to prevent dissidents from participating in a scheduled meeting or
event. Security officers often offer no charge to justify the detentions—a clear violation
of due process rights—but warn detainees of longer arrests if they continue
to participate in activities considered critical of the government. In September
2007, for example, police detained more than 40 dissidents in several cities who
were traveling to a protest in Havana at the Ministry of Justice. All were released
after the protest. In April 2008, wives of political prisoners, known as the Ladies
in White, were arrested when they tried to stage a peaceful sit-in in Havana’s
Revolution Plaza.
Prison Conditions
Prisoners are generally kept in poor and abusive conditions, often in overcrowded
cells. Political prisoners who denounce poor conditions or who otherwise fail to
observe prison rules are frequently punished with long periods in punitive isolation
cells, restrictions on visits, or denial of medical treatment.
Death Penalty
In February 2008 the government commuted the death sentences of all prisoners
except three individuals charged with terrorism. The Cuban government does not
make public information about how many people are on death row, but it is estimated
that between 20 and 30 sentences were commuted. Nevertheless, Cuban
law continues to prescribe the death penalty for a broad range of crimes.
Human Rights Defenders
Refusing to recognize human rights monitoring as a legitimate activity, the government
denies legal status to local human rights groups. Individuals who belong
to these groups face systematic harassment, with the government impeding their
efforts to document human rights conditions. In one 2008 case, four members of
the Cuban Human Rights Foundation were arrested and sentenced to four years in
prison in a summary judgment that was hidden from public view, according to the
Council of Human Rights Reporters. Cuba remains one of the few countries in the
world to deny the International Committee of the Red Cross access to its prisons.
Key International Actors
In February 2008 the Cuban government recognized core international human
rights principles by signing the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
(ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
(ICESCR), although as of November it had not ratified them. At the time of signing,
the government indicated it was considering making several reservations to the
treaties.
In response to this and economic reforms under Raul Castro, in June the European
Union lifted sanctions on Cuba, which it had originally imposed after the 2003
crackdown on dissidents. The EU publicly called on Cuba to release all political
prisoners and honor the rights protected in the signed treaties. In mid-2009 the
EU is due to investigate what progress Cuba has made toward fulfilling ICCPR and
ICESCR commitments, and will weigh whether to maintain diplomatic relations.
The US economic embargo on Cuba, in effect for more than four decades, continues
to impose indiscriminate hardship on the Cuban people and to block travel to
the island. In an effort to deprive the Cuban government of funding, the US government
enacted new restrictions on family-related travel to Cuba in June 2004.
Under these rules, individuals are allowed to visit relatives in Cuba only once
every three years, and only if the relatives fit the US government’s narrow definition
of family—a definition that excludes aunts, uncles, cousins, and other kin
who are often integral members of Cuban families. Justified as a means of promoting
freedom in Cuba, these travel policies undermine the freedom of movement
of hundreds of thousands of Cubans and Cuban-Americans, and inflict profound
harm on Cuban families.
