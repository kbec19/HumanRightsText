FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA
SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
A major restructuring of the Yugoslav federation was under way in 2002,
although by November it had not come to a formal conclusion. On March 14, the
authorities in the two constituent republics agreed to create a new state under the
name of Serbia and Montenegro. The new arrangements confirmed the exceptionally
high level of autonomy that both republics already enjoyed. But the agreement
slowed the drive to independence favored by a narrow majority of the Montenegrin
electorate.Montenegrin officials stated that they entered into the agreement under
pressure from the European Union and with an understanding that the agreed constitutional
framework was provisional.As of November, the Serbian and Montenegrin
sides had been unable to agree on a system for electing the future parliament
and had therefore failed to produce a constitutional charter that would finalize the
restructuring.
In October parliamentary elections in Montenegro, the moderates with a longterm
goal of independence for Montenegro won an absolute majority of seats
against the parties advocating closer ties with Serbia and the pro-independence
radicals. Presidential elections in Serbia, held in September and October, failed to
produce a winner because the second round turnout was below the 50 percent
threshold required by the election law.
Progress on accountability was slow, both with regard to the surrender of
indictees to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)
and the tribunal’s access to archives and witnesses in the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (F.R. Yugoslavia). As of November 2002, only one individual, Bosnian
Serb Ranko Cesic, accused of war crimes in a detention camp in the Bosnian town
of Brcko in 1992, had been arrested and transferred to The Hague during the year.
Five indictees surrendered voluntarily: Dragoljub Ojdanic and Nikola Sainovic,
indicted for war crimes in Kosovo in 1999; Milan Martic, indicted for the cluster
bomb shelling of civilian objects in Zagreb in 1995;Mile Mrksic, former Yugoslav
army commander accused of crimes against humanity for the alleged killing of at
least two hundred non-Serbs near the Croatian city of Vukovar in 1991; and Momcilo
Gruban, a wartime shift commander in the Bosnian Serb-run prison camp
near Prijedor.
On April 11, the Yugoslav parliament adopted a law on cooperation with the
ICTY. Contrary to Yugoslavia’s United Nations (U.N.) obligations, a provision
in the law stated that it would apply only to individuals against whom indictments
had already been issued at the time it came into force. The law also contained
a number of ambiguities regarding procedures for cooperation with the
ICTY.
For months the authorities failed to facilitate access for ICTY investigators to
Yugoslav archives and potential witnesses. By mid-year this began to change,
although at the time of writing the tribunal did not yet completely have the access
it had requested. In July and August, the government freed a number of police officials
from the obligation to guard state secrets while giving testimony in the trial of
Slobodan Milosevic. (See below.) The government also allowed limited access to
the requested archives.
In February, a Serb government official acknowledged to the media, under condition
of anonymity, that Ratko Mladic, ICTY indictee and the former commander
of the Bosnian Serb army, had been protected by the Yugoslav army up to that time.
On the record, Serbian officials throughout the year denied knowledge of Mladic’s
whereabouts or, in the alternative, argued that an attempt to arrest him would trigger
civil war in the country. A dozen other ICTY indictees were believed to live in
the country during the year.
Four domestic war crimes trials were held in 2002. On July 8, the district court
in Prokuplje, Serbia, sentenced Ivan Nikolic, a former Yugoslav army reservist, to
eight years in prison for the killing of two Kosovo Albanian civilians in May 1999.
On September 10, the high court in Bijelo Polje, Montenegro, sentenced Nebojsa
Ranisavljevic to fifteen years of imprisonment for participation in the abduction
and killing of nineteen Yugoslav Muslims at a train station in Strpci (in the border
area between F.R.Yugoslavia and Bosnia and Herzegovina) in 1993.On October 11,
the military court in Nis sentenced two Yugoslav army officers and two privates to
five and seven years, and three and four years of imprisonment respectively, for the
killing of two ethnic Albanian civilians in April 1999. Finally, in October the trial
began in Prokuplje against Sasa Cvjetan, a former reservist in the anti-terrorist unit
of the Serbian police, accused of killing nineteen Kosovo Albanian civilians in
March 1999.
The police and judiciary failed to act to resolve a number of other war crimes
cases, in which a significant body of evidence was known to exist. These included
the case of mass graves in Serbia, exhumed in 2001, in which up to six hundred bodies
of Kosovo Albanians had been buried.
As of November, the truth and reconciliation commission, established in 2001
by Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica, had failed to hold any hearings on war
crimes and other abuses committed during the 1990s in Serbia and other parts of
the former Yugoslavia. The slow progress was in part due to the commission’s limited
budget of only U.S.$20,000. The courts in Serbia and Montenegro failed to
resolve any of the high-profile cases of political assassination that were committed
or attempted during the rule of Slobodan Milosevic.
The authorities did not use police violence against the political opposition, but
during the year police abuses against ordinary citizens were still commonplace.The
Serbian Ministry of Interior either ignored allegations of police torture and illtreatment
made in the media and human rights reports, or claimed that it had no
knowledge of the alleged events. Of the eight known court decisions since October
2000 dealing with torture and ill-treatment by the police, all but one of a dozen convicted
law enforcement officers received sentences of less than eight months in
prison, even where the torture resulted in serious bodily injuries.The exception was an August 2002 court decision in which one accused policeman was sentenced to
eighteen months of imprisonment.
Serbian human rights groups and media registered a dozen serious cases of
police torture between December 2001 and October 2002. The abuses often
occurred in police stations, when officials attempted to compel detainees to admit
to theft or other crimes. As a consequence of the abuse, in one case the victim
underwent brain surgery (Nenad Tasic, tortured in August in Vranje); other victims
suffered a ruptured eardrum (Nemanja Jovic from Belgrade), bruised ribs (Marko
Brkic from Novi Sad), and other physical injuries.
On July 18, the Serbian parliament amended the law on the judiciary to
strengthen the role of parliament in the selection of judges, at the expense of an
independent body of experts, the High Judicial Council.The new provisions left the
council its role in nominating judicial candidates but, in cases where parliament
rejects the nomination, gave the decision on alternative candidates to parliament’s
judicial committee.The amendments also excluded the High Judicial Council from
the procedure for the election of the presidents of the courts.
On February 26, new legislation in Serbia replaced the death penalty with a maximum
prison sentence of forty years. In June, Montenegro also abolished death
penalty.
Although the Yugoslav constitution and law on the army allowed for alternative
military service in civilian institutions, the army continued to reject all requests by
conscientious objectors for service in humanitarian, health, or other similar institutions.
While most of the media operated freely during 2002, the cabinet of the Serbian
Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic effectively shaped the editorial policy of the two
main private television stations in F.R. Yugoslavia, Television BK and Television
Pink, through behind-the-scenes pressures.
The governments of Serbia and F.R. Yugoslavia failed to protect freedom of
expression when extreme nationalists repeatedly disrupted an exhibition of war
photographs by American artist Ron Haviv. The exhibition mostly consisted of
images documenting war crimes in Bosnia, Croatia, and Kosovo. The nationalists’
threats and violence,which no government official denounced, forced the organizers
to close down the exhibition in Uzice, Kragujevac, and Cacak. Only in Cacak
were misdemeanor charges brought against the perpetrators, resulting in three
minor penalties.
On February 13, the federal parliament adopted a Law on the Rights and Freedoms
of National Minorities. The law was prepared with the assistance of the
Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,
and it provided for broad protection of minority rights. The treatment of Hungarians,
Bosniacs, Croats, and Albanians in Serbia (outside of Kosovo) was satisfactory
in 2002, but police brutality against Roma continued to take place, and
discrimination against Roma in various fields of public life remained widespread.
Prosecutors continued to dismiss complaints of discrimination or simply
failed to take any action to address them, and legal provisions against discrimination
remained inadequate. Thousands of Roma families, many of them displaced
from Kosovo, continued to live in makeshift settlements in the vicinity of towns, an August 2002 court decision in which one accused policeman was sentenced to
eighteen months of imprisonment.
Serbian human rights groups and media registered a dozen serious cases of

from Kosovo, continued to live in makeshift settlements in the vicinity of towns, Serbia and Montenegro, the governments prepared draft laws to establish an
ombudsman. The laws had not been adopted as of November.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
In a report presented on March 25 to the U.N. Commission on Human Rights,
Jose Cutileiro, special representative on the situation of human rights in Bosnia and
Herzegovina and F.R. Yugoslavia, criticized police ill-treatment in Serbia and the
lack of implementation of government plans for national minorities in Montenegro.
On February 12, the trial of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
began at the ICTY.Milosevic stood accused of command responsibility for crimes
committed against non-Serbs in Kosovo, Bosnia, and Croatia. Between February
and September, the prosecutor presented evidence of alleged crimes against
humanity and war crimes committed in 1999 in Kosovo. On September 26, the
presentation of evidence for crimes in Croatia and Bosnia began. Milosevic was
conducting his own defense, and he often used the significant latitude the trial
chamber allowed him in the cross-examination of witnesses to make arguments
only vaguely related to the charges contained in the indictment.
Six other individuals were transferred from F.R.Yugoslavia to the custody of the
ICTY in 2002 (see above),but trial had not begun in any of these cases as of November.
The tribunal provisionally released two indicted Yugoslav citizens, Pavle Strugar
and Miodrag Jokic, after receiving guarantees from the Yugoslav government
that the two would appear for trial.
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) mission to
F.R. Yugoslavia organized, jointly with the Serbian Ministry of Interior, multiethnic
police trainings aimed at establishing an ethnically mixed police presence in the
area of Presevo,Bujanovac,and Medvedja, the three municipalities in southern Serbia
with a significant Albanian minority. The OSCE also monitored and positively
evaluated the July 28 municipal elections in this area. In June, it organized a conference
focusing on domestic war crimes trials. The session concluded with an
observation that there were “substantial problems within the judiciaries now that
should be addressed if the administration of justice is to meet international standards
and the standards set out in the European Convention on Human Rights.”
The OSCE mission in Belgrade assisted the Serbian authorities in the reform of
media and the judiciary. In Montenegro, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions
and Human Rights (ODIHR) focused on the October 20 parliamentary and
presidential elections. In a report issued in August, the ODIHR gave a negative
assessment of the new legislation on the elections and the media, which had been
enacted by an ad hoc coalition of pro-Serb parties and the pro-independence radicals.
On ODIHR’s advice, the elections took place under the old legislation in place at the time the elections were called, supplemented by a limited number of additional
rules that the major parties adopted by consensus in September. ODIHR
concluded that the elections were conducted generally in accordance with international
standards.
Council of Europe
The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) recommended
membership for F.R. Yugoslavia at its plenary session in September. In connection
with its vote the PACE outlined a list of commitments on which progress would be
scrutinized post-accession, in areas including cooperation with the ICTY, domestic
war crimes trials, police abuse, and discrimination against Roma. The Committee
of Ministers declined at its November session, however, to formally invite F.R.
Yugoslavia to become a Council of Europe member, because Serbia and Montenegro
had failed to produce a constitutional charter of a new state.
In a recommendation on the situation of refugees and displaced persons in F.R.
Yugoslavia, adopted in June, the PACE expressed concern about “the still unresolved
question of refugees and internally displaced persons” in the country and
called for renewed efforts on the part of the international community and the
authorities of F.R.Yugoslavia to address the problem.
On December 19, 2001, the European Court of Human Rights declared inadmissible
for lack of jurisdiction the application by six Belgrade families against the
seventeen member states of NATO that are also parties to the European Convention
on Human Rights. The complaint concerned the April 23, 1999 bombing by
NATO during the Kosovo conflict of the Belgrade headquarters of Radio-Television
Serbia, in which relatives of the applicants had been killed.The court found that the
deceased were not within the jurisdiction of the respondent states,due to the NATO
states’ lack of effective control of Serbia at the time the bombing took place.
European Union
In the course of 2002, the E.U. acted as a mediator in negotiations between the
Serbian and Montenegrin authorities over constitutional reform. Montenegrin
officials occasionally accused the E.U. of bias in favor of Serbia. E.U. High Representative
for Foreign Policy and Security Javier Solana, and his special envoys, visited
Yugoslavia on a number of occasions and participated in the negotiations.
European Commissioner for External Relations Chris Patten also met with Serbian
and Montenegrin officials on July 3 in Belgrade.He announced that financial assistance
to Yugoslavia would increase from Û195 million (U.S.$192 million) in 2002
to Û255 million ($251 million) in 2003.
In an April 4 Stabilization and Association Report, the European Commission
identified police reform, eradication of corruption, improvements in freedom of
expression, and cooperation with the ICTY as the main outstanding issues that the
authorities needed to address. The E.U.’s failure to insist on Yugoslav cooperation
with the ICTY, however, prompted ICTY Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte in April to
urge stronger E.U. pressure.
United States
On May 21,U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell lifted a freeze on financial assistance
to F.R.Yugoslavia, after receiving assurances from Yugoslav officials that they
would cooperate with the ICTY. U.S. economic pressure was instrumental in the
adoption of the ICTY cooperation law and other measures taken by Belgrade to
improve cooperation with the ICTY.At the same time, in August the U.S. requested
that the Yugoslav government enter into an agreement with the U.S. whereby
Yugoslavia would commit itself not to transfer U.S. citizens accused of war crimes
to the International Criminal Court. Individual Yugoslav officials either opposed
the request in strong terms or stated that Yugoslavia would take a stance identical
to that of the E.U. No such agreement with the U.S. had been signed as of this
writing.
KOSOVO
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Kosovo’s first post-conflict general elections, held in November 2001, were
largely peaceful and fair. Ibrahim Rugova’s Democratic League of Kosova (LDK)
won a significant lead over the other parties, but not enough for a majority in the
120-seat Assembly. Thirty-five seats, including twenty guaranteed by the Constitutional
Framework, went to the Kosovo Serb “Return” Coalition and five other
minority parties. The successful conduct of the election was overshadowed, however,
by difficult subsequent negotiations among the LDK, the Democratic Party of
Kosova (PDK), and the Alliance for the Future of Kosova. It took until the end of
February 2002, and three abortive parliamentary votes, for the parties to agree on
Rugova’s election as president of Kosovo and the appointment of Bajram Rexhepi,
a physician and former PDK mayor of Mitrovica/Mitrovice, to head the new government.
In February, the U.N. secretary-general appointed German diplomat Michael
Steiner as his new special representative in Kosovo. In April, Steiner presented the
U.N. Security Council with an “exit strategy” that contained a series of benchmarks
to be met before Kosovo’s final status would be decided and the international mission
terminated; these included respect for the rule of law, freedom of movement,
and the right of all Kosovars to return to their homes. Questions about Kosovo’s
final status—that is, its future relationship with Serbia—continued to affect the
overall stability of the province and led to the first tensions between the newly
elected institutions and the U.N.Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).
Municipal elections held in October 2002 were judged “within European standards”
by international monitors, but were marred by the killing of Ukë Bytyçi, the
LDK mayor of Suva Reka/Suhareke, the day after the ballot.The majority of Kosovo
Serb voters boycotted the elections, in a blow to U.N. efforts to integrate them into
the local political processes.
The year saw, for the first time since 1999, a significant decline in the number of
life-threatening attacks against minority communities. In order to remove psychological
barriers to free movement, the Kosovo peacekeeping force (KFOR) replaced
checkpoints and other static security arrangements around minority areas with
mobile patrols. Serbs and other non-Albanians began to venture out of their
enclaves onto the main roads and into towns. Despite these improvements, however,
minorities—including Roma and other non-Albanians as well as Serbs—generally
faced a precarious security environment. The greater mobility made them
subject to persistent intimidation and harassment, such as stone throwing, vandalism,
and verbal abuse. In October, a large Albanian mob attacked a bus carrying
Serb pensioners in the town of Pec/Peja and injured several UNMIK police officers
escorting it.
Realities and perceptions of insecurity, as well as scarce donor commitment,
affected the return of refugees and internally displaced Kosovars. The number of
returns remained low, despite statements of support by the new local institutions
and an UNMIK campaign to inform potential returnees about improving circumstances
in the province. UNMIK faced repeated threats of mass returns from
groups of displaced Kosovo Serbs, and pressures by the Belgrade authorities to
build large, segregated enclaves for returning minorities. Kosovo Roma refugees in
Macedonia protested unbearable camp conditions and complained that the international
community was neglecting their plight. Ethnic Albanian local officials in
Kosovo, on the other hand, continued to resist significant minority returns, despite
their proclaimed support for the process.
With the exception of the high-profile Milosevic trial at the ICTY, there was little
progress toward accountability for war crimes committed during the conflict,
clearly undermining the processes of refugee return and reconciliation.Neither the
Serbian authorities nor UNMIK took effective steps to hold accountable lowerlevel
Serbs for crimes committed against Albanians; at the same time, no Albanians
were indicted for war crimes against Serbs, Roma, and other civilians. The ICTY
prosecutor said in October that investigations of ethnic Albanian suspects were
being hampered by witnesses’ reluctance to confirm their earlier statements and
appear in court. The number of war crimes convictions handed out by the Kosovo
courts remained insignificant, with most trials ending in acquittals or convictions
for lesser crimes.
Although the U.N. stepped up efforts to hold accountable those responsible for
post-war ethnically motivated crimes, most such perpetrators remained at large. In
December 2001, the Supreme Court ordered the release of three Kosovo Albanians
implicated in the February 2001 bombing of a bus full of Serb civilians. The U.N.
administrators complied, after having held the suspects for months in extrajudicial
detention in defiance of similar court orders; they claimed “it had not been possible
to transform the [relevant] intelligence …into evidence that would secure their
conviction in a court of law.” To address such problems, the UNMIK Department
of Justice and the UNMIK police set up specialized structures to gather and analyze
evidence in sensitive cases.
While police statistics showed a general decrease in violent crime during the
year, KFOR troops and the UNMIK police faced some of the most aggressive confrontations since their deployment. The attackers were often Serb and Albanian
extremist groups that had been tolerated for too long by the peacekeeping mission.
The hottest security spot continued to be northern Mitrovica/Mitrovice,where the
February arrest of two “bridge watchers” (a violent gang supposedly organized to
protect the town’s Serbian population from Albanian attacks) triggered a wave of
growing vandalism against the international forces. On April 8, when UNMIK
police arrested a bridge gang leader, a rioting crowd responded with hand grenades
and gunfire, leaving twenty-two police officers injured.
Later in the year, the UNMIK police made a failed attempt to arrest Milan
Ivanovic, the extremist leader of the Serb National Council for northern Kosovo,
who was reportedly caught on tape attacking the police during the April riots.
When Ivanovic fled to Serbia, the Belgrade authorities not only refused to hand
him over, but also urged him not to surrender. This was only the most blatant
refusal by Belgrade to stop supporting Kosovo Serb radicals and illegal parallel
institutions (including parallel courts and security structures) that undermined
UNMIK’s authority, individual rights, and the Serb minority’s reintegration into
a multiethnic Kosovo. After months of international pressure, Ivanovic surrendered
to UNMIK police in October and was released on bail by an international
judge.
Kosovo Albanian leaders’ support for the rule of law was tested throughout 2002
as UNMIK police conducted a series of arrests of former Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA) members.At least four different groups, including several active members of
the Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC), were charged with serious crimes against fellow
ethnic Albanians allegedly committed during and after the armed conflict. In
November 2001, Gani Ymeri, a senior KPC officer, was arrested for the alleged kidnapping
and attempted murder of a Kosovo Serb family in the last days of the conflict;
investigations into the case were ongoing as of October 2002, but Ymeri had
in the meantime been released on bail.
The arrests of Kosovo Albanians met with negative reaction from the Albanian
public, frustrated by the judiciary’s ongoing failure to address the crimes they had
suffered as well. Each of the high-profile arrests was followed by protests, which
turned violent in February and August, but subsided with time. However, the
August detention of former KLA commander Rustem Mustafa, on reported
charges of wartime murder and torture of fellow Albanians, triggered a barrage of
accusations against UNMIK by the media and politicians associated with the rebel
movement. The Kosovo government issued an official statement charging that the
KLA leaders’ arrests were politically motivated. Such attitudes put unacceptable
pressure on the pending judicial proceedings and prejudged their outcome.
Women’s groups welcomed the inclusion of rape charges in the Milosevic
indictment on Kosovo, as amended in October 2001. In 2002, Kosovar Albanian
victims of rapes committed during the 1999 campaign of “ethnic cleansing” gave
testimony on those charges at the ICTY, facing Milosevic in the courtroom.
The UNMIK police estimated that 104 establishments operated with trafficked
women and girls forced into prostitution throughout the province.Despite efforts
to train prosecutors and judges, both still failed to observe elements of a new antitrafficking
regulation designed to protect trafficking victims. The lack of witness protection for victims who agreed to testify against their traffickers remained a
major concern. This, coupled with bribery and intimidation of the judiciary, frustrated
police efforts to crack down on traffickers, who continued to operate with
widespread impunity.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Human rights groups did important monitoring, reporting, and advocacy in
the province, although they were constrained by the security situation and, on
occasion, the international administration. In January, Serb “bridge watchers” in
Mitrovica/Mitrovice seized two vehicles and harassed staff members of the
Humanitarian Law Center. The center said that the bridge gang consistently prevented
its staff from crossing into the northern part of town to observe trials. The
Council for the Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms protested against the
refusal of the Pristina/Prishtina prison authorities to grant them access to
detainees.
Ombudsperson Marek Antoni Nowicki, who was reappointed for a second
term, made good headway toward the consolidation of the ombudsperson institution
and started preparations for its gradual handover to local leadership. The
ombudsperson’s second annual report was highly critical of UNMIK’s human
rights record, citing, among other things, its arbitrary restrictions of liberty and
property rights, violations of basic suffrage, and failure to make legislation available
in local languages.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
As new crises unfolded around the world, the international community began
to show signs of peacebuilding fatigue in Kosovo. This led to calls for a speedier
handover of authority to local institutions, but also raised concerns that a premature
disengagement would be counter-productive for regional peace and
stability.
United Nations
The U.N. mission strengthened its efforts to steer Kosovo toward a path of democracy,
rule of law, and economic recovery.More than three years into its international
administration, however, the mission continued also to restrict and derogate
from basic rights, invoking vague justifications of internal emergency and threats
to international peace and security. One instance of such arbitrariness was the decision—
taken without any due process—to bar three party leaders from contesting
the November 2001 election.
On a number of occasions, members of the peacekeeping mission violated fundamental
rights and set negative precedents for the rule of law in Kosovo. In one
egregious example, in February an Austrian officer of the UNMIK police, along with two local subordinates,beat an ethnic Albanian detainee for three hours,made
him dig his own grave, and forced him to walk through a Serb village wearing a sign
that read: “I kill all Serbs!”The officer was detained and stripped of his U.N.immunity,
but was then illegally whisked out of Kosovo by the Austrian authorities,who,
as of this writing, refused to send him back for prosecution in Kosovo. UNMIK
served an indictment to the Austrian government, but no trial date had been set as
of late October.
A lengthy report by Mental Disability Rights International revealed that patients
at Kosovo’s psychiatric facilities were routinely subjected to physical and sexual violence,
arbitrary committal, and grossly inadequate treatment. According to the
rights group, UNMIK was informed of the abuses, but did little to guarantee the
patients’ physical integrity and basic rights.
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Mission in
Kosovo continued to play an important role, in particular through its monitoring
and reporting on the situation of minorities, the judicial system, and property
rights. A detailed analysis of seventeen war crime trials, published in September,
found serious deficiencies in their prosecution and adjudication. These included
lack of evidence gathering capacities, insufficient support for judges and prosecutors,
ignorance of international humanitarian law, and poor legal reasoning in
general.
North Atlantic Treaty Organization
In May, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) announced a reduction
of its thirty-eight thousand-strong presence in Kosovo by around five thousand
troops, stressing that this reflected the improved security situation rather than a
waning commitment to the region. The NATO-led KFOR continued to violate
habeas corpus rights by detaining individuals without charge and without bringing
them promptly before a judge.An OSCE report charged that neither international
law nor the security situation on the ground supported such practices.
European Union
The E.U., Kosovo’s biggest donor, announced in September a significant reduction
in future aid to the province—Û50 million (U.S.$48.3 million) for 2003, down
from Û134 million ($129.6 million) in 2002. E.U. officials said they were shifting
focus from physical reconstruction aid to the strengthening of Kosovo’s institutions.
The E.U. supported UNMIK’s efforts to uphold the rule of law and condemned
the government’s allegations of bias regarding the arrests of former KLA
commanders.
United States
The United States pushed for accelerated efforts to reach sustainable self-government
in Kosovo, while encouraging the E.U. to take the lead in assisting and
integrating the region. The State Department’s second report on trafficking in persons
included only a cursory statement on the Kosovo situation, even though its
annual human rights report found that trafficking “was a serious and growing
problem” in the province.
