HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Factional conflict within Iran’s clerical leadership continued to result in severe
restrictions on freedom of expression, association, and political participation.
Deteriorating economic conditions made worse by severe natural disasters contributed
to increasing unrest and a pervasive sense of social insecurity, reflected in
clashes between demonstrators and the security forces and in harsh measures
against drug-traffickers and other criminals. President Mohammad Khatami won
another landslide victory for those associated with the cause of political reform
when he was reelected by 77 percent of voters for a second four-year term in June,
but the power struggle between conservatives and reformists remained unresolved.
Conservative clerics maintained a strong grip on power through the judiciary, the
Council of Guardians and the office of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei.Promises by reformists to increase respect for basic freedoms and
the rule of law remained unrealized, and severe restrictions imposed on the independent
print media, the major visible gain of President Khatami’s first period in
office, remained in place. The judiciary, and branches of the security forces beyond the control of the elected government, resorted increasingly to intimidatory tactics,
with a sharp increase in public executions and public floggings. Conservative clerics
taunted critics of corporal punishment, and accused them of being opposed to
Islamic rule—in some cases even calling for the shedding of the blood of such critics.
Such remarks fueled an increasingly polarized political stand-off, which, coupled
with governmental ineffectiveness in the face of mounting economic and
social problems, contributed to a volatile situation where the threat of political violence
loomed large.
The clampdown on the independent print media that had followed the sweeping
reformist victory in parliamentary elections in February 2001 (see Human
Rights Watch World Report 2001) was followed by the detention of scores of leading
independent and reformist figures and activists.Many of these activists had participated
in the flowering of the independent press in the late 1990s as writers, editors,
and publishers. Other targeted activists included supporters of the national religious
trend, a loose alliance of intellectuals and politicians advocating Islamic government
with adherence to the rule of law and the constitution,who for many years
had been one of the few currents of internal political opposition tolerated by the
establishment.
Seventeen reformist figures, many of them prominent, were brought to trial in
October 2000 in connection with their participation in an international conference
on the future of Iran, held in Berlin, Germany, in April 2000. The trial before the
Tehran Revolutionary Court was unfair.Many of the defendants were held in protracted
incommunicado detention after returning from Berlin, during which time
they were forced to make incriminating statements that formed the evidence
against them at their trial. Akbar Ganji, a well-known investigative journalist who
was among the accused, protested at his hearing in November 2000 that he had
been beaten by his interrogators while in detention in order to pressure him to confess
to crimes.Most of the trial was conducted behind closed doors.
On January 13, the court convicted seven of the defendants on vague charges of
having “conspired to overthrow the system of the Islamic Republic.” The severest
sentences, ten years of imprisonment,were passed on Akbar Ganji and Saeed Sadr,
a translator at the German embassy in Tehran. A second translator, Khalil Rostamkhani,
received a nine-year sentence, even though he had not attended the conference.
His wife, Roshanak Darioush, a translator of German literature into
Persian, had served as a translator at the conference but did not return to Iran to
face charges. The trial and the harsh sentences imposed on local employees of the
German embassy appeared designed to cause maximum embarrassment to President
Khatami’s government in its relations with Germany, a major trade partner
which he had visited in 2000, and with other European states.
The court also sentenced student leader Ali Afshari to five years in prison, and
veteran politician Ezzatollah Sahhabi to four and a half years. Both were already in
prison by the time the trial began in October 2000.Women’s rights activists Shahla
Lahidji and Mehrangiz Kar each received four-year prison sentences, but were
released pending an appeal. Ezzatollah Sahhabi was also provisionally released, but
he was re-arrested following public remarks he made in March and was still
detained without charge in November.
An appeal court reduced Akbar Ganji’s sentence to six months of imprisonment but before he could be released, the Tehran Press Court sentenced him again to a
ten-year term on the same charge of conspiring to overthrow the system. He had
the right of appeal but no appeal had been heard by November. In March and April,
the authorities detained more than sixty political activists associated with the
national religious trend, including the leadership of the formerly tolerated Freedom
Movement (Nehzat-e Azadi). Throughout its fifty-year history the Freedom
Movement had been an advocate of constitutional Islamic rule with respect for
democratic principles. On March 18, the Tehran Revolutionary Court ordered the
closure of the Freedom Movement, accusing it of attempting to “overthrow the
Islamic regime.”
These detentions further chilled the political climate in the run-up to the June
presidential election as opponents of reform showed themselves determined to
intimidate, silence, or punish those known to support the reformist cause. A leading
conservative cleric, Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi, stated in April: “what is being
termed as reform today is in fact corruption.” And other conservatives sought to
discourage President Khatami, the reform movement’s figurehead, from standing
for a second term.When he could not be discouraged, they signaled by their actions
that regardless of the outcome of the election, there would be no concession to the
reformist agenda.
Another persistent challenger to the dominant orthodoxy of the conservative
clerics who held power was Ayatollah Hossain Ali Montazeri, the former designated
successor to Ayatollah Khomeini as Leader of the Islamic Republic. He remained
under house arrest in Qom, but his criticism of the present system, especially of the
institution of the velayat-e faqih (rule of the supreme jurist), continued to circulate
by cassette tapes, photocopied statements, and through the Internet. In December
2000, the authorities detained the ayatollah’s son for allegedly distributing illegal
literature, but the real reason appeared to be related to the publication of Ayatollah
Montazeri’s memoirs on the Internet. These directly attacked the position of
Supreme Leader, arguing that the concentration of power in the hands of one man
was contrary to Islamic principles. Protests about the continuing restrictions on
Ayatollah Montazeri’s liberty mounted throughout the year. In June, the ayatollah’s
children (with the exception of his jailed son) circulated a letter calling for the lifting
of these restrictions, and 126 out of 290 members of parliament signed a similar
statement. President Khatami several times publicly criticized the stifling of
dissent, including closures of newspapers and magazines, and the imprisonment of
political dissidents, but he appeared unable or unwilling to remedy these problems.
In February, in a speech marking the Islamic Revolution’s twenty-second anniversary,
he warned: “those who claim a monopoly on Islam and the revolution, those
with narrow and dark views, are setting themselves against the people.” He also
complained repeatedly that he lacked the power to carry out his obligation as president
to uphold the constitution. But even after his sweeping election victory in
June, when he increased his share of the popular vote, he continued to shy away
from open confrontation with his opponents and made no discernible progress in
implementing his promised reforms. Increasingly, through his statements, he
appeared to represent more of a safety valve for public frustration than an agent of
tangible change.
A severe drought in the east and floods in the north-west exacerbated the country’s economic malaise and contributed to public scapegoating of Afghan
refugees and migrants,who were blamed for high unemployment and rising crime
and were increasingly a target of violence.Afghans were viewed as particularly culpable
for drug offenses, and thousands were detained and scores executed in an
intensified official clampdown on alleged drug-traffickers. The government repatriated
thousands of other Afghans under a process agreed with the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),despite insufficient safeguards to prevent
those at risk of persecution being returned. At the same time, there were new
influxes of refugees fleeing continuing unrest and violence in Afghanistan,
although the border was officially closed by Iran. The repatriation process was
halted with the onset of U.S. bombing raids in Afghanistan in October, when there
were fears of a further massive influx to add to the one and a half to two million
Afghan already displaced to Iran.
Law enforcement authorities made increased use of public executions and corporal
punishment, often after only cursory trial proceedings. In February, five convicted
drug-traffickers were publicly executed by being hanged from construction
cranes in the Khak-i Sefid district of Tehran, part of an intensified clampdown on
drug-traffickers, and the authorities carried out more than twenty public executions
for drug-related offenses in July and August. Public floggings were also
increasingly used for a wide range of social offenses, including breaches of the dress
code, despite opposition from Ministry of Interior officials who questioned the
effectiveness of such punishments. In July and August, clashes reportedly occurred
at public floggings and executions in Tehran between police and demonstrators
opposed to these punishments.
In August, the parliamentary commission charged with investigating human
rights violations by public institutions, known as the Article 90 Commission, produced
a report sharply critical of deteriorating prison conditions. The report itself
was not made public, but members of the commission said it identified the sharp
rise in the number of offenders being sent to prisons as a major cause of prison
overcrowding and the high level of drug abuse among prisoners.More than twothirds
of all prison inmates were reportedly held for drug-related offenses, and
AIDS and other diseases were reported to be spreading rapidly among the prison
population.
The proliferation of unofficial, illegal detention centers, such as the so-called
Prison 59 in Tehran, gave major cause for concern.Prison 59 was reportedly administered
by the Ministry of Intelligence, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and
clandestine paramilitary forces, and was entirely beyond official oversight. Political
prisoners detained there or in similar facilities could be held for months at a time
without their families or lawyers being informed or having any idea of their whereabouts,
treatment or conditions, and being powerless to seek remedies.
The independent press, before it was closed down in mid-2000, had sought to
expose the connections between certain state institutions and the clandestine
underworld of death squads and enforcers. It was the investigative journalism of
people such as Akbar Ganji that led to the prosecution of eighteen Intelligence Ministry
officials for alleged involvement in the murder of a group of intellectuals and
political leaders at the end of 1998. (See Human Rights Watch World Report 2000.)
On January 27, fifteen of these defendants were convicted after a trial mostly held behind closed doors: three were sentenced to death, five received life imprisonment,
and seven received prison terms of between two and a half and ten years. It
remained unclear, however, who had ordered the murders: press investigators had
pointed to senior figures, such as former information ministers Dori Najafabadi
and Ali Fallahian, as possible suspects but they were not charged and no information
against them emerged at the trial. On August 18, the Supreme Court reversed
the convictions of the fifteen ministry officials, who may be re-tried. Lawyers representing
the murder victims’ families accused the judiciary of failing to ensure a
thorough inquiry into the crimes.
In a similarly unrevealing trial in May, guilty verdicts were announced against
the so-called Mahdaviyat group, a group linked to the authorities, who were convicted
of inciting violence against Sunni Muslims and committing political killings.
This trial, which involved links between state bodies and illegal political violence,
was held behind closed doors.The sentences have not been publicly announced but
its was reported in the press that at least one of the defendants was sentenced to
death.
Earlier, on January 30, the Supreme Court rejected the appeals against conviction
of ten members of the minority Jewish community in Shiraz who had been
sentenced to prison terms in 2000 for allegedly maintaining contacts with Israel,
considered a hostile foreign power.None of the group were released.
The conservative backlash set in motion by the sweeping reformist victory in
parliamentary elections in February 2000 showed no signs of abating.By the end of
November 2000,more than fifty daily and weekly newspapers had been issued with
closure orders, and more than twenty leading independent and reform-minded
journalists, editors, and publishers remained in prison. In January 2001, the
authorities closed the philosophical and cultural monthly,Kiyan. The journal had
published academic articles debating the philosophical underpinnings of the
reform movement. The conservative faction also sought to prevent reformists
being elected to the parliament. Before the June parliamentary election, held concurrently
with the presidential vote, the Council of Guardians vetoed 145 out of 356
candidates nominated for the seventeen seats, a far higher proportion than in February
2000. In a further display of conservative power, in August, the parliament
was forced to accept two candidates nominated by the judiciary to the Council of
Guardians. The parliament initially rejected the two nominated jurists, Mohssen
Ismaili and Abbas Ali Khadkhodai, claiming that they lacked adequate experience,
but the head of the judiciary, an appointee of the supreme leader, refused to withdraw
their names. Eventually, the Council of Expediency, another body appointed
by the supreme leader headed by former president Hashemi Rafsanjani, crafted a
rule change whereby the appointments were ratified without obtaining majority
approval from members of parliament.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
A few members of parliament were willing to confront what they viewed as conservative
attempts to circumvent and undermine their constitutional powers as the
people’s elected representatives, and to speak out against violations of constitutional principles. They included outspoken parliamentarian Fatima Haqiqatjou,
who protested the arrest of journalists and accused the judiciary of exceeding its
constitutional functions. Her criticisms made her the target of criminal prosecution,
and in August she was sentenced to twenty-two months in prison for “spreading
propaganda against Islam” and insulting state officials. Haqiqatjou appealed
her conviction, denying the charges and also claiming parliamentary immunity for
comments made in the course of parliamentary debate. She remained at liberty
pending her appeal. However, seven other reformist parliamentarians were facing
charges for remarks they had made under the cover of parliamentary immunity,
part of a growing struggle between conservative elements of the judiciary and
reformist members of parliament.
Despite the silencing of the independent press, the debate about human rights
remained at the center of the political struggle in Iran, especially within the clerical
leadership. Reformist clerics repeatedly argued that there was compatibility
between Islam and international human rights principles; conservative clerics, just
as insistently, asserted that appeals for liberty and respect for human rights were
akin to apostasy.
Hassan Youssefi Eshkevari,who was detained in August 2000 for advocating liberal
interpretations of Islam supportive of international human rights principles,
continued to be imprisoned.He had been convicted of apostasy in a secret trial by
a Special Court for the Clergy. In September, however, he was allowed to leave
prison for two days and it was unclear whether or not he remained under sentence
of death.
Access to the country for independent human rights investigators remained
restricted, although representatives of international human rights organizations
were allowed to visit Iran to attend conferences. The U.N. special representative on
Iran,Maurice Copithorne of Canada, continued to be denied access to the country,
but in April he was able to meet in Geneva with Abbas Ali Alizadeh, the head of the
Tehran justice department, the highest level judicial official he had been able to
meet with for several years.
In May, the International Center for Dialogue Among Civilizations, headed by
the reformist former minister of culture and Islamic guidance, Ataollah Mohajerani,
together with a clerically-supported private university in Qom, hosted an
international human rights conference in Tehran with a diverse group of participants.
Iranians who attended in the conference were candid in their criticism of
domestic conditions.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
Iran played an active role in multilateral diplomatic efforts in the human rights
field, hosting, in February, the Asian regional preparatory conference for the United
Nations World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia
and Related Intolerance (WCAR) and entering into negotiations with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights over a program of technical
assistance in the human rights field. In April, the United Nations Commission
on Human Rights renewed the mandate of the special representative on Iran.
European Union
Relations with the E.U. continued to improve. British government minister
Marjorie Mowlam visited Iran in February: she praised the government’s efforts to
combat drug-trafficking but criticized continuing human rights violations including
the clampdown on journalists and the press. In September, Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharazi met with E.U. commissioners for wide-ranging talks.Human rights
concerns were again reported to be part of the agenda, but the major emphasis was
on expanding trade ties.
British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw visited Iran twice following the September
11 attacks on the U.S. This first visit by a senior British minister for several years
focused on the crisis in Afghanistan rather than domestic human rights issues in
Iran.
United States
Contrary to some initial expectations, oil industry interests closely associated
with the new Bush administration brought no discernible shift in U.S. government
relations with Iran. Restrictions on freedom of expression and persecution of
minority religious communities were roundly condemned in the State Department’s
Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, and the U.S. continued to voice
objections to Iran’s alleged efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction, its
alleged support for international terrorism, and its opposition to peace efforts
between Israel and the Palestinians.
In April, the Iranian parliament convened an international conference in support
of the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation, which was attended by
representatives of numerous groups on the U.S. government’s list of terrorist
organizations, including Lebanese Hizbollah, and the Palestinian groups, Hamas
and Islamic Jihad.At the preparatory conference for the WCAR, Iran supported the
insertion of language singling out Israel and Zionism for special criticism. These
high-profile forays into the Israeli-Palestinian dispute provoked U.S. ire. In April,
Attorney General John Ashcroft named the government of Iran as an unindicted
co-conspirator in the attack on the Khobar Towers barracks in Saudi Arabia in
1999. In May, Iran was identified as a state sponsor of terrorism in the State Department’s
Patterns of Global Terrorism Report. The Iranian government responded
sharply to this accusation: “The U.S. government, which itself is one of the supporters
of Israeli state-terrorism, is not in any position to judge us.”
In this climate of increasing rhetorical antagonism against Iran it came as no
surprise in June when the International Relations Committee of the House of Representatives
voted to maintain sanctions against Iran for a further five-year term.
The Bush administration had originally signaled a preference for a two-year renewal
of the sanctions regime, but with opposition from Congress, the administration voiced its support for long-term enforcement of sanctions. The U.S. government
continued to support policies seen as unfavorable toward Iran in disputes over control
over exports of energy resources from the Caspian Basin region.
If the U.S. and Iran were clearly divided on their policies to the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict, they had more in common with respect to their shared concern over
the Taliban government in Afghanistan. In the aftermath of the September 11
attacks on New York and Washington, and the identification of the Afghanistanbased
Osama Bin Laden as a prime suspect in these attacks, the possibility of closer
cooperation between the U.S. and Iranian governments emerged as a prospect for
the first time in more than twenty years.
