PAKISTAN
General Pervez Musharraf took steps that further consolidated the army’s
authority and all but ensured that any future government would operate under military
tutelage.With media attention focused on internal unrest following Pakistan’s
break with the Taliban and its public support for the United States-led intervention
there, Musharraf ’s movement toward establishing a controlled democracy faced
little international opposition. Musharraf arguably emerged from the political
realignment that occurred following the September 11 attacks on the U.S. in a
stronger position. He reshuffled the military corps command so as to marginalize
key Taliban backers; arrested leaders of religious parties who challenged his authority;
and secured a critical rescheduling of Pakistan’s debt, donor commitments of
new loans, and the lifting of existing sanctions.Nevertheless, the potential domestic
fallout from a prolonged U.S. presence in Afghanistan and the possibility of a
Northern Alliance-dominated government emerging in Afghanistan left Musharraf
clearly discomfited by November.
Mainstream political parties continued to operate under tight constraints.A ban
on rallies remained in force, and the authorities detained thousands of political
party members and activists to forestall planned demonstrations against government
policies and continued military rule. The government used a draconian
accountability law that it introduced shortly after the October 1999 coup as leverage
in a largely unsuccessful attempt to fashion a pliant party leadership.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
The formation of the multiparty Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy
(ARD) on December 3, 2000, posed the first major challenge to military rule and
remained a principal target of the Musharraf administration during the first
months of the year.The alliance brought together by the country’s two largest political
organizations—the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) of deposed Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif and the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), led by the self-exiled former
prime minister Benazir Bhutto—with the avowed aim of restoring parliamentary
government through immediate elections. In an apparent effort to forestall the
alliance from pursuing its objectives and to control any restoration of parliamentary
government, the Musharraf administration lent tacit support to a group of dissidents
within the PML who had broken with Sharif after the coup and who
opposed the formation of the alliance.
The National Accountability Ordinance was a key instrument in this effort. The
ordinance, enacted in November 1999 ostensibly to facilitate prosecution of officials
and other leaders for corruption and other illegal acts, combined unchecked
powers of arrest, investigation, and prosecution in a single institution, the National
Accountability Bureau (NAB). The ordinance provided for detention of suspects
for up to ninety days without charge, abolished bail, and established special accountability courts. Additional provisions required that trials be conducted
within thirty days of charges being filed, effectively limiting defendants’ ability to
arrange an adequate defense, and automatically barred those convicted under the
ordinance from holding public office for twenty-one years.
Although linkages could not conclusively be drawn, events suggested that the
government withdrew accountability cases against PML leaders or improved conditions
of detention in exchange for obtaining their support for the dissident faction
or their resignation from party posts. Syed Ghous Ali Shah,who had been held
by NAB since his April 2000 acquittal in a plane hijacking conspiracy case against
Sharif and his senior aides, resigned as the PML president for Sindh province on
March 2, 2001; the move was followed by Shah’s transfer from NAB custody to a
hospital. On March 8, before new elections for a party president were held, about
two hundred pro-dissident activists of the Sindh PML youth wing forcibly occupied
the PML office in Karachi. Police were subsequently deployed in the area, but
did not interfere with the takeover.Within days of the occupation, an accountability
case was withdrawn against the Sindh PML youth wing leader.
In April, the Pakistan Supreme Court ordered the government to modify the
ordinance to restore the right to bail and reduce pretrial detention to fifteen days.
However, the court order did little to limit the potential for selective application of
the law; detention periods could be extended at the court’s discretion, and the burden
of proof remained on the accused.
The other major devices employed by the government to limit opposition political
activity were the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) ordinance, which
broadly prohibited any speech deemed “likely to cause fear or alarm to the public”
or “likely to further any activity prejudicial to public safety or the maintenance of
public order,” and a ban on “political meetings at public places, strikes and processions”
that was imposed in March 2000. Officials announced in August that they
would lift the ban ninety days before the general elections scheduled to take place
in October 2002.
On two separate occasions, authorities arrested hundreds of ARD leaders and
activists to forestall planned protests. On March 20, police in Punjab carried out
mass arrests to prevent the ARD from holding a rally that had been planned for
March 23; ARD leaders said that about two hundred party members were detained
in Lahore alone and some 2,500 throughout Punjab. A second rally, planned for
May 1 in Karachi, was similarly suppressed.According to the Sindh home secretary,
Mukhtar Ahmed, about 850 ARD members had been taken into “protective custody”
throughout the province as of April 30. On May 1, protesters clashed with
police across Karachi, chanting, waving placards, and throwing stones. Police
responded with baton charges and tear gas, arresting three hundred people.
Regional parties were also prevented from holding planned protests. On April 9,
police in Karachi used batons, fired tear gas, and arrested about ninety people,
many of them women, who were protesting against water shortages in Sindh
province. Two days later, police arrested thirty activists of the Muttahida Qaumi
Movement (MQM) and Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz (JSQM) after they arrived outside
the Karachi Press Club to begin a fast to protest the shortages.
For much of the year, the authorities enforced the ban on political meetings selectively. They prevented mainstream political parties from holding meetings,
but allowed religious parties to hold regular meetings and processions in most parts
of the country. This changed after September 11, however, when Musharraf
announced his administration’s support for the U.S.-led anti-terrorism coalition.
Religious parties that continued to mobilize protesters in support of the Taliban, or
who explicitly challenged Musharraf ’s authority, faced arrest.
On October 7, North West Frontier Province (NWFP) authorities placed
Maulana Fazlur Rehman, leader of the Jamiat Ulema-i Islam (JUI), and Maulana
Samiul Haq, leader of a JUI splinter party,under house arrest.On October 22,more
than one hundred members of the JUL and the Jamiat-e Islami (JI) were arrested
in Sindh, reportedly to thwart plans by the parties to stage a sit-in at Jacobabad, site
of a Pakistani air base used by U.S. military personnel. On November 3, authorities
placed JI head Qazi Hussain Ahmed under house arrest to prevent him from participating
in an anti-U.S. rally in the Bajaur tribal agency bordering Afghanistan.
Two days later, the government filed sedition charges against Ahmed; although
details of the charges were not specified,Ahmed had two weeks earlier accused the
government of working against national interests in a speech in Rawalpindi, near
the federal capital.
The withdrawal of government support from the Taliban starting in September
and the government’s decision to back U.S.-led military action in Afghanistan also
triggered public protests in Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan province. On October
8, police clashed with protesters at rallies in Quetta involving some seven to
eight thousand demonstrators,many of them Afghan refugees. On October 9, three
Afghan refugees were shot dead by police in Kuchlak, a small town close to Quetta,
with police reportedly failing to give warnings or use teargas or other means to control
the mob before opening fire.
The militarization of civilian institutions, a trend already observable during
Nawaz Sharif ’s second term in office, continued under Musharraf. According to
official records cited by the respected Lahore-based weekly Friday Times, at the
beginning of the year about 175 serving and retired military officers held high-level
civilian posts. In addition, Musharraf had established a countrywide network of
army monitoring teams to supervise and assist in the functioning of the civilian
bureaucracy. The teams were constituted at the provincial, regional, and district
levels and consisted of army personnel, Directorate of Military Intelligence personnel,
and members of the Inter-Services Intelligence Agency’s field units. In practice,
local observers claimed, the teams interfered with the autonomy of the civilian
bureaucracy and frequently disregarded civil procedure laws.
At the executive level,Musharraf initiated moves that institutionalized his personal
authority and formalized the military’s role in governance. On June 20, he
amended his 1999 Proclamation of Emergency Order, formally dissolving the suspended
national and provincial assemblies, and issued a President’s Succession
Order enabling him to assume the presidency the following day.How long his term
of office would last was not clear.Musharraf justified his actions as being necessary
to ensure political and economic stability. On July 4, Musharraf issued an order
reconstituting the National Security Council (NSC) that he had established immediately
after the coup.Under the new guidelines, it would aid and advise the president on “Islamic ideology, national security, sovereignty, integrity, and solidarity of
Pakistan.”The revamped NSC was to be chaired by the president and consist of the
chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff committee; the naval, army, and air force chiefs;
provincial governors; and “such other members as may be appointed by the president
in his discretion.”The government also announced on August 14 that it would
promulgate new constitutional amendments in 2002 aimed at introducing checks
and balances in government. Officials said that the proposed amendments would
be opened for public debate but would be finalized by June 30, 2002 without a public
referendum.
In July, the government barred twenty-five candidates from the Jammu and
Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) from contesting assembly elections in the Pakistan-
held portion of Kashmir, known in Pakistan as Azaad Kashmir, after they
refused to sign a declaration pledging their support for the accession of Kashmir to
Pakistan. Several dozen JKLF supporters were also arrested during protests over the
elections.
Candidates associated with the mainstream political parties took the lion’s share
of the seats in the non-party local government elections, dealing a setback to government
ambitions of establishing local bodies that were not bound to provincial
political interests and were directly accountable to the federal government.While
accepting the need for accountable government at the local level, Pakistani human
rights activists faulted the design and implementation of the administration’s plan.
Election planners had reserved 33 percent of the seats for women in an affirmative
effort to increase women’s participation in the political process. But during local
government elections held on March 21 and July 2 in parts of the North-West Frontier
Province,women voters were reportedly threatened and intimidated from voting
and running for office by conservative religious activists.The election results in
these areas were nevertheless upheld.
Many voters belonging to religious minorities boycotted the local government
elections after federal authorities disregarded demands by minority nongovernmental
organizations and community leaders to hold the elections on the basis of
a joint electorate. Introduced at the national and provincial levels by Pakistan’s last
military ruler, General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq, the separate electoral system
reserved a limited number of seats for each minority community and limited the
franchise of non-Muslim citizens to the seats that had been allotted to their respective
communities. The system was widely criticized by minority activists as having
contributed to their communities’ political marginalization.
Under the Musharraf administration’s local government plan, seats were
reserved for minorities in districts and sub-divisions of districts where they form
10 percent or more of the population. Of the 210 seats reserved for minorities in
Sindh’s Larkana division, which had a large Hindu population, only fifty-six
declared candidates during the first phase of the local government elections, in
December 2000; of those, fifty-two ran unopposed. A similar pattern was observable
in several districts of Punjab with significant Christian minorities.
The government promptly condemned an October 28 attack on a Christian congregation
in the southern Punjab town of Bahawalpur, and ordered an investigation
into the incident. Eighteen people were killed when masked gunmen entered St. Dominic’s Church, locked the doors, and fired at the assembled worshippers.
Although Bahawalpur has been scarred by sectarian violence between Sunni and
Shi’a Muslims in recent years, human rights investigators said it was the first attack
directed at Christians in the area.
In September 2000, the government established the Commission on the Status
ofWomen.Despite its directive to safeguard and promote women’s rights, the commission
had few powers to implement its mandate and in 2001 made little progress
in the way of setting forth concrete recommendations. Human rights activists
decried continued impunity and lenient sentences for so-called honor crimes
against women, the practice of punishing women said to have brought dishonor to
their families.
The government officially closed Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan in November
2000, citing an inability to absorb additional refugees. The border remained
formally closed throughout 2001, though refugees continued to make their way to
Pakistan, with about 200,000 entering the country between September 2000 and
September 2001, and a further 150,000 arriving after the start of U.S.-led bombing
on October 7. The government attempted at the beginning of the year to prevent
the registration of new arrivals, deported thousands of undocumented Afghans
who were already living in the country, and sought to uproot a large, established
refugee community at Nasir Bagh, near Peshawar. A screening agreement reached
with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in August,
after protracted negotiations with the government, was shelved after the September
11 attacks on the U.S. a temporary relocation of UNHCR’s international staff.
The government subsequently identified a number of sites near the border where it
proposed relocating new arrivals from Afghanistan as well as residents from two
camps near Peshawar and the transit camp at the Chaman border crossing.
In a welcomed move affecting labor rights,Pakistan,on August 15, ratified International
Labor Organization (ILO) Convention No. 182,which called for immediate
and effective measures to secure prohibition of the worst forms of child labor,
as well as ILO Convention No. 100, concerning equal remuneration for men and
women.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Pakistani human rights groups played a vital role in challenging the government’s
policies toward refugees and, especially in the case of minority NGOs, its
retention of the separate electorate.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
The international community almost unanimously eased diplomatic and economic
sanctions when Pakistan backed the U.S.-led anti-terrorism coalition. Pressure
for elections and a return to constitutional rule in 2002 was eased, while key donors made commitments of huge aid packages for Afghan refugee relief and
basic economic assistance. Some donors resumed arms sales.
United States
On September 22, the Bush administration,with strong Congressional backing,
waived economic sanctions imposed on Pakistan after its 1998 nuclear tests, allowing
the U.S. to approve loans at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
World Bank. On October 30, President Bush signed legislation giving him authority
to waive “democracy sanctions” on Pakistan, imposed following the October
1999 coup, opening the door for the sale and licensing of military equipment
through September 30, 2003. However, the administration refused a request from
Pakistan to transfer twenty-eight F-16 fighter planes that Pakistan had purchased
in the 1980s.
On November 10, President Bush announced more than U.S. $1 billion in
U.S. support to Pakistan, including direct budgetary assistance, funds for control of
its borders, anti-terrorism assistance, Afghan refugee relief, financial support
through the IMF,debt relief, and trade assistance. In September,Washington agreed
to reschedule U.S. $379 million of Pakistan’s $3 billion debt obligation to the U.S.
President Bush met with President Musharraf at the United Nations in
earlyNovember.Musharraf repeated his pledge to hold national elections by October
2002. A visit to Pakistan by Secretary of State Colin Powell in mid-October was
largely overshadowed by renewed fighting in Kashmir, which ended a ten-month
cease-fire.
European Union
On October 17, the U.K. announced a 15 million pound debt relief package to
Pakistan to help cope with the Afghan refugee crisis and internal reforms. On
November 24, Pakistan signed a new Co-operation Agreement with the European
Community, replacing the 1986 agreement. The signing of the agreement had initially
been postponed following the October 1999 coup. In a joint declaration, the
European Union and Pakistan “reconfirmed their commitment to the respect, protection
and promotion of human rights and democratic principles.” Pakistan also
reiterated “its firm commitment to return to democratic government in accordance
with the roadmap announced by President Musharraf on August 14, 2001.” Ongoing
European Commission development cooperation projects in Pakistan totalled
195 million euros, and were primarily focused on social sector development.
Commonwealth of Nations
In its concluding statement of March 20, 2001, the Commonwealth Ministerial
Action Group criticized the restrictions imposed by the Musharraf administration
on political parties, including their formal exclusion from the local government
elections, and pressed the regime to shorten its electoral timetable and to restore full democratic rule. The ministers agreed that Pakistan should remain suspended
from the councils of the Commonwealth pending the restoration of democracy.
On August 21, Commonwealth Secretary General Don McKinnon met
with President Musharraf in Islamabad to discuss plans to restore democracy by
October 2002.He also met with politicians from the disbanded parliament.
Japan
On October 26, Japan joined the E.U., the U.S., and Canada, and lifted economic
sanctions against Pakistan. Japan had frozen new grants and loans, except for
humanitarian aid, to Pakistan since the country conducted nuclear tests in 1998.
In September, Tokyo announced it would consider rescheduling some of Pakistan’s
$500 million debt and offeredU.S. $40 million in emergency aid for Pakistan
including assistance for refugees. Prior to September 11, Japan had decided to give
more than U.S. $70 million in Official Development Assistance (ODA) in the form
of grants and soft loans for various health, education, and communication projects.
Foreign Minister Makiko Tanaka met President Musharraf in Islamabad in late
November to express support for Pakistan’s counter-terrorism efforts and invited
him to Tokyo for the ministerial conference on Afghanistan’s reconstruction scheduled
for early 2002.Tanaka also pledged an additional U.S. $300 million in grant aid
to Pakistan over the next two years.
International Financial Institutions
The World Bank on October 24 approved a U.S. $300 million loan to promote
privatized banking, and planned to provide additional assistance bringing the
total for fiscal year 2002 to about $600 million. The Asian Development Bank
announced plans to give Pakistan a total of U.S. $950 million in 2001, increased
from $626 million planned prior to September 11. In late October, the U.S.
was negotiating with the International Monetary Fund for a line of credit for Pakistan
of up to U.S. $1 billion. On October 24, the Islamic Development Bank
approved U.S. $25 million to help finance imports of energy products.
