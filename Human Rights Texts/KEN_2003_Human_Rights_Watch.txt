KENYA
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
After twenty-four years of autocratic rule by President Daniel arap Moi, Kenya
looked forward to a general (presidential and parliamentary) election scheduled
for December 2002.Kenyans also awaited a new constitution, after two years of procedural
wrangles. Widespread corruption and lawlessness eroded the country’s
social and economic fabric, as living standards hovered at their lowest level in
decades, but pressure also mounted to hold officials accountable for past crimes.
There were continuing concerns over police brutality, judicial wrongdoing, and
attacks on freedom of expression.
In October 2001, quelling rumors that he would run for another term, President
Moi agreed to step down in January 2003.However, his public promotion of Uhuru
Kenyatta, son of Kenya’s founding president, Jomo Kenyatta, as his hand-picked
successor outraged civil society groups and opposition politicians. Kenyatta, an
inexperienced legislator appointed by the president in October 2001, was viewed as
beholden to Moi. This interference in the process of choosing a new leader divided
the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU), which nevertheless voted to
grant Moi sweeping powers within the party upon retirement as president. Bolstering
KANU’s chances going into the election was its March merger with the
largest opposition party, the National Development Party, but deepening divisions
within the new KANU threatened to offset that advantage. In September, a coalition
of opponents, the National Alliance Party of Kenya (NAK), sought to capitalize
on the KANU divisions by uniting to field its own presidential candidate, Mwai
Kibaki, a former vice-president who had unsuccessfully run for president twice
before. The next month, NAK and a KANU faction known as the Rainbow Coalition
joined forces in a “super alliance” called the National Rainbow Coalition that
posed the first serious challenge to the ruling party in Kenya’s history.
The Constitution of Kenya Review Commission, made up of government appointees and civil society representatives, originally planned to produce a draft
constitution by September 2002.However, riven by internal bickering and dogged
by government attempts to delay and disband it, ahead of the deadline the commission
requested and won an extension until January 2003 to complete its work.
It conducted civic education countrywide to gather views about a new constitution.
KANU attempted to link the commission’s extension with an extension of the life
of Parliament by as many months,but, after a public outcry,President Moi told Parliament
to end its term in February 2003, as required in law.The commission issued
its draft constitution in September after all, despite Moi’s efforts to block it through
the courts. The document outlined radical recommendations to reduce the power
of the executive by creating the posts of prime minister and two deputy prime ministers,
adding a second parliamentary chamber, and providing for presidential
impeachment. It also recommended a complete judicial overhaul and replacing
appointed local authorities with locally elected officials. In October, just as delegates
to a national constitutional conference were preparing to debate the draft,
Moi dissolved Parliament, effectively halting the constitutional review because the
conference by law had to include members of parliament (MPs). Three days later,
Moi moved to disband the constitutional review team and had the conference
venue sealed off by armed police. Bolstered by a mounting campaign by lawyers
and civil society representatives against Moi’s heavy-handed tactics, the review
commission refused to disband, although it was forced to adjourn the national constitutional
conference until a new Parliament was in place.
With a leadership turnover imminent, the issue of official accountability escalated
into a debate over amnesty for economic crimes and government-sponsored
violence. In defiance of a July court order, President Moi refused to release a threeyear-
old report by the presidential Commission on the Ethnic Clashes (known as
the Akiwumi Commission) on politically motivated ethnic violence that occurred
throughout the country between 1991 and 1998. In October, Moi released the
report, which implicated several high government officials. At a function marking
the 1997 attacks in Likoni, near Mombasa in Coast Province, which had sparked
armed ethnic attacks in Mombasa in the run-up to the last general election, human
rights activists urged presidential candidates to promise to investigate and prosecute
these and other political killings.Human Rights Watch published a report on
the 1997 Coast Province violence in May, documenting the role of the ruling party
in the violence and emphasizing the dangerous nexus between arms availability
and politically motivated ethnic violence in Kenya. Perpetrators of the Likoni
attacks told Human Rights Watch they had been backed by ruling party officials.
The arms flow from neighboring war zones continued to undermine Kenya’s
security, increasing the death toll from inter-ethnic violence, especially in Tana
River and North Rift regions.The spread of small arms, combined with the manipulation
of ethnic tensions by politicians, presented particular risks in an election
year. Kenya’s two previous general elections had been marked by bloodshed.
In Nairobi, the capital, violence erupted in two slums, Kibera in late 2001 and
Kariobangi in March 2002. At least twenty-five people died in Kariobangi at the
hands of vigilante gangs allied to certain ethnic groups and politicians, and while
the police—who had ignored warnings of impending violence—made thirty-one arrests, they had not followed through with prosecutions as of this writing. In Kibera
police went on their own rampage, raping, beating, looting and destroying
property, and thousands of residents fled. The government ignored charges of
political incitement in Kibera and ordered no independent inquiry. Although the
police commissioner banned eighteen vigilante groups and private armies tied to
prominent politicians in March, little enforcement took place. In fact, in August the
armed Mungiki faction, the main vigilante group involved in the Kariobangi massacre,
staged a massive demonstration in Nairobi in support of Uhuru Kenyatta,
with no police interference.
Police violently broke up or canceled numerous opposition party rallies, denying
freedom of assembly to thousands of Kenyans whose main source of information
about candidates was such gatherings. For example, in August, an opposition
MP, James Orengo, was jailed for a few days for trying to hold a meeting.With political
opposition higher in cities than in the countryside, the ruling party used youth
gangs and local civic authorities in the run-up to the election to conduct sweeps of
certain urban populations perceived to traditionally vote against the government.
Repeated sweeps in Mombasa by police and gangs acting with public encouragement
by a local KANU MP displaced eight thousand street hawkers belonging to
Kikuyu and other ethnic groups thought to be anti-KANU.Hundreds of families in
the slums of Nairobi and four other cities were also evicted.
Women’s rights groups focused on the December election as an opportunity to
boost their low numbers in elected office and win passage in a new Parliament of
legislation on domestic violence,property rights, and other issues affecting women.
Kenya hosted close to 250,000 refugees at the beginning of 2002, principally
from Somalia, Sudan and Ethiopia. In two new waves, ten thousand Somali
refugees fled fighting in southwest Somalia in the spring. Nearly half of the new
arrivals returned to Somalia after at least four refugees were killed by gunfire from
the Somali side of the border, and amid reports of intimidation by the Kenyan
police. Kenya’s two major refugee camp complexes, Kakuma and Dadaab, were
plagued with insecurity, incidents of rape and other violent crimes, and a serious
reduction in food distribution because of inadequate supplies and donations.
Refugees living in Nairobi also suffered from rights abuses, many of which were
linked to the Kenyan government’s insistence that they reside in camps and not in
urban areas.While no accurate numbers existed, the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that as many as sixty thousand
refugees were living in Nairobi in 2002. Two young refugee children from Rwanda
were murdered, and their mother seriously injured, during a nighttime knife attack
in a UNHCR-run residence on April 17. In another incident in May, police conducted
raids against “foreigners,” arresting approximately eight hundred individuals
who were held for several days in dismal conditions in an outdoor pen next to
the Kasarani police station.At least 145 of the detainees were documented refugees
who were charged with failing to register with the government—a statutory provision
that was enforced for the first time, and with which no refugee could comply
since government registration stopped in 1991. Similar group arrests took place in
October 2001 and February 2002. Foreigners, including refugees, were often
blamed for crime and insecurity and targeted for arbitrary arrest and detention.
Despite mounting public outrage over police brutality, incidents of killings and
beatings in jail, rape, unlawful confinement, and excessive force continued. The
government had yet to reflect the United Nations (U.N) Convention Against Torture
in domestic law, despite having ratified it in 1997, and reports of torture persisted,
especially of jailed opposition supporters in rural areas. In January,President
Moi ordered authorities to build confidence in the jail system, commenting, in reference
to torture and HIV/AIDS, “Currently, the public believes that once you are
jailed, you will be lucky to come out alive.”Prison conditions nevertheless remained
harsh, although accountability improved somewhat under new leadership, as symbolized
by the arrest of four wardens accused of the September 2000 killing of six
prisoners; the four were charged in July 2002 with murder.
The judicial system was described in July by Yash Pal Ghai, chairman of the constitutional
review commission, as “incompetent and lethargic.” Echoing an advisory
panel of Commonwealth judicial experts, Professor Ghai said the judiciary
had watched as the country’s human rights record deteriorated, and that without
urgent court reforms, a new constitution by itself could not fully guarantee
Kenyans’ rights. In a rare show of independence, a Kenyan court in May ordered the
electoral commission to correct the imbalance whereby some constituencies had
far fewer voters than others, yet had equal representation in Parliament.
Freedom of expression lost ground when courts awarded a series of record damages
to establishment figures bringing libel suits against the media over unflattering
stories. Although the press published freely, Parliament passed a law aimed at
government control of newspapers: An amendment to the Books and Newspapers
Act, the new law imposed exorbitant publishing fees that could handicap newspapers
economically and silence new voices. Both these developments appeared
designed to mute public criticism in an election year.
The government also continued harassing journalists. For example, in August, a
magazine publisher and opposition MP, Njehu Gatabaki, was sentenced to six
months’ imprisonment for his magazine’s coverage of politically instigated ethnic
killings in Rift Valley before the 1997 general election. President Moi ordered his
release a week later following public criticism. Some radio stations, especially those
in rural areas, faced long delays before they could air programs,while the state-run
Kenya Broadcasting Corporation enjoyed nationwide broadcast. In a potentially
positive development, however, the government announced that both radio
licenses and frequencies would now be issued from the Communication Commission
of Kenya, rather than separately from the commission and the government—
a move that could speed up the issuing of licenses.
As regards children’s rights, the year began positively with a new children’s law
guaranteeing free primary school education and criminalizing forced marriages
and female genital cutting.But reports of high rates of child labor and teenage girls’
recruitment into the sex trade, as well as the caning death of a thirteen-year-old
pupil, highlighted serious abuses perpetrated against children.Kenya had the third
highest number of AIDS orphans in the world, according to a U.N. report.
Kenya is a party to the Mine Ban Treaty, and in December 2001 declared it had a
total of 38,774 antipersonnel mines, some three thousand of which would be
retained for training. In September 2001,Kenya was chosen as co-rapporteur of the Standing Committee on Mine Clearance.Kenya’s military was involved in the U.N.
demining operation along the Eritrea/Ethiopia border.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
After years of inaction on human rights, Parliament passed a bill creating an
autonomous Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, to replace a standing
committee appointed by President Moi several years ago. The president had not
signed the bill as of this writing. The traditionally weak standing committee grew
more aggressive in the last few years, even prodding the government to produce a
long-overdue National Action Plan on the Protection and Promotion of Human
Rights. A new national steering committee of standing committee members and
civil society groups was to submit a draft plan to the government for endorsement
and forwarding to the U.N.
Sporadic government harassment of human rights activists occurred, for
instance in August, when police broke up a Mombasa meeting to elect officials for
the Coast Civil Society Forum.Other human rights groups—pressing for an end to
police brutality, curbs on freedom of assembly, government corruption and violations
of the right to life and property—routinely faced similar harassment by police
and local authorities when they attempted to hold civic education meetings.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
Kenya’s importance as a strategic ally in the war against terrorism prompted
Western governments to be muted on human rights, albeit their focus on government
mismanagement and corruption remained strong. The United States in particular
increased support for Kenya. International donors continued to withhold
funding until anti-corruption conditions set by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and World Bank in January 2000 were met. While Kenya made some
progress on conditions, it still had to pass anti-corruption legislation, prosecute
significant graft cases, and speed up privatization. The donors also insisted on a
code of ethics for public servants, repeal of a law controlling interest rates, and
strengthening of a new anti-corruption police unit.President Moi and government
officials accused lenders of coercion and “shifting goalposts.”
Kenya’s endemic corruption reached inside the World Bank itself: in May its officer
in charge of Kenya’s roads program pleaded guilty to bribery. Earlier in the year,
three Nairobi employees of UNHCR were charged with taking bribes from people
seeking resettlement to third countries.
European Union
A gap deepened between E.U. donors and Kenya’s ruling party, as donors stood
firm with the IMF on aid conditions. The United Kingdom (U.K.), once a staunch
supporter of Moi’s regime, toughened its stance. In a January visit to Nairobi, the foreign affairs minister Baroness Valerie Amos said there would be no softening of
U.K. policy on aid to Kenya as a result of Kenyan support for British and American
anti-terrorism efforts. The U.K. also warned KANU against delaying the election.
The British government withheld half its aid after Kenya failed to pass anti-corruption
legislation, but continued to give support in other areas, such as the war on
HIV/AIDS, reproductive health, and education. Citing mismanagement, Belgium
ended aid to Kenya, while the Netherlands scaled back its assistance. Despite cooling
relations, Kenya allowed the U.K., along with Germany, to fly reconnaissance
missions along the coast in search of al-Qaeda elements in the region.
United States
Despite a stinging State Department report cataloguing widespread human
rights abuses, and the Bush administration’s concerns over poor governance, the
U.S. maintained strong support for Kenya, its strategic ally in East Africa. The war
on terrorism dominated relations. In December, U.S. anti-terror teams advised
Kenyan officials on security and money-laundering issues, and Walter Kansteiner,
assistant secretary of state for Africa, met with President Moi to discuss terrorism.
Soon after, three thousand U.S. troops held joint military exercises with Kenyan soldiers
on the coast. In March, General Tommy Franks, head of the U.S. military’s
Central Command, included Kenya in a tour of Horn nations as he sought support
for anti-terrorism.
The U.S. provided support for constitutional review and anti-graft police training
by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Overall, assistance to Kenya in fiscal year
2002 was $53.1 million, primarily for fighting HIV/AIDS, but also for food and
rural development. A supplemental request to Congress for $7 million in economic
support and $15 million for military aid (up from $1 million the previous year) targeted
border security in the northern and eastern regions, reflecting U.S.-Kenyan
cooperation in the war on terrorism. Trade between the two countries rose. In the
first visit ever to sub-Saharan Africa by a U.S. trade representative, Robert Zoellick
met with President Moi and his cabinet to discuss economic growth, investment,
trade and terrorism.
