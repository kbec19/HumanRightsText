 SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE*
 Sao Tome and Principe has been a one-party state since gaining
 independence from Portugal in 1975. Effective political power
 is concentrated in the Presidency. The country is composed of
 two small islands off the West Coast of Africa with a
 population of about 100,000. At independence, the Movement for
 the Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe acceded to control of
 the Government, and Manuel Pinto Da Costa, leader of the
 political party, was chosen President without opposition by the
 Popular Assembly, constitutionally the supreme organ of state
 and highest legislative body. The party reconfirmed him for a
 second five-year term in 1980.
 The Government draws heavily on Marxist-Leninist principles.
 State control of the means of production (mainly cacao
 plantations) is the general rule. In practice, freedoms of
 speech, press, and assembly are circumscribed, and no public
 expression of opposition to the Government is permitted. All
 news media are under government control.
 All political opposition, whether through political parties or
 otherwise, is prohibited. Small opposition groups in exile in
 Portugal and Gabon have thus far shown no evidence of being
 able to influence events on the Islands. There is no known
 organized political opposition in Sao Tome itself. The small
 Sao Tomean army is reinforced by troops from Angola. There are
 a few Soviet and Cuban military advisors.
 The economy of Sao Tome has encountered serious problems in
 recent years due to the steady decline in cacao exports. This
 reflects both lower world prices for cacao and serious
 management problems on the nationalized plantations. The
 situation became particularly acute in 1983 when poor rains
 further reduced both cacao and food crops, resulting in serious
 food shortages. Considerable food assistance from the United
 States and other Western countries delivered in 1984 has
 largely solved the immediate problem, but food shortages are
 expected to recur.
 There was no known change in the overall human rights situation
 in 1984.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings in 1984.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of abductions or secret political arrests
 in 1984.
 *There is no American Embassy in Sao Tome. Information on the
 human rights situation is therefore limited.

 SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 No reports of such abuses were received in 1984.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There have been reports that at least eight Sao Tomeans were
 arrested early in 1984 and detained without trial because of
 public criticism of the Government. These include individuals
 detained for expressing open dissatisfaction with the
 Government's handling of the food situation. The reported
 arrival of anti-government tracts in Sao Tome in late 1984 led
 to the cancellation of a number of exit permits and possible
 imprisonment of those held responsible. Otherwise, there have
 been no reports of groups of people being detained since late
 1982 on the Island of Principe. An estimated 100 people may
 have been imprisoned without trial.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution does not address the right of public trial,
 although there have been instances of public trials of
 individuals accused of common crimes in recent years. Criminal
 trials are occasionally reported by the local media. To date
 thb only political prisoners who were given trials were those
 accused of coup-plotting in 1977. In those trials and in
 criminal trials since that time, the accused were assigned
 counsel by the Government. There is no tradition of
 independent defense counselors; common criminals are given a
 hearing and sentenced by a judge.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Because of Sao Tome's geographic isolation and small
 population, the Government does not have a highly intrusive
 security system to detect opposition opinion. However, the
 Government's loosely organized system of informers and
 monitoring of individual participation in the activities of the
 Country's sole legal political party insure that potential
 dissidents are identified.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The security services are alert and quickly react to public
 expressions of opposition or dissatisfaction with the
 Government. The only Sao Tomean media are organs of the
 Government, consisting of one television station which
 broadcasts two days per week, a radio station which carries
 music, government-prepared news releases, and instructional
 programs, and a weekly two-to-four page newspaper of
 government-prepared news releases. There are no foreign wire
 service items other than occasional items from Soviet and
 Angolan sources. Sao Tome radio also uses Voice of America
 taped music programs. No public written or oral criticism of
 the Government is tolerated.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political assembly and activity are legal only within the
 country's sole political party, the Movement for the Liberation
 of Sao Tome and Principe. The party exists to encourage
 popular support for the Government. The sole trade union
 confederation is affiliated with the party, and workers are
 prohibited from striking. The union confederation participates
 in the International Labor Organization and is affiliated to
 the Organization of African Trade Union Treaty. Virtually all
 economic activity takes place within the constraints of the
 government-run economy. Cultural and social organizations are
 reported to require government approval, which is believed to
 be easily obtained.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 This right is included in the national Constitution. The three
 religious communities on Sao Tome -- Roman Catholic,
 Evangelical Protestant, and Seventh-Day Adventist -- are
 allowed to practice freely. The Government provides some
 funding for a school and social services center managed by the
 Catholic church.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 The geographic isolation and poverty of the country severely
 limit foreign travel and emigration. The Government closely
 controls exit visas for the few people who do travel.
 Anti-government tracts which appeared in Sao Tome late in 1984
 led to the confiscation of a number of exit permits and
 reported imprisonment of those suspected to be responsible for
 the leaflets. Almost all trips are for governmental missions
 or medical evacuations. Domestic travel is not controlled by
 the Government, but the lack of reliable and affordable air
 service between the islands limits travel.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Government policy is determined by President Da Costa, in
 consultation with his key cabinet and security officials. The
 leadership uses the single political party to consolidate its
 rule at the local levels, and to assist in selecting candidates
 for the Popular Assembly. In the circumstances, the citizens
 have little opportunity to change the Government or to
 influence its actions. In 1983 there was one "assemblea,' a
 series of mass meetings lasting several days, to encourage
 popular support for the Government. There were no elections
 held in 1984. No public expression of opposition to the
 Government is permitted. There are small exile groups in
 Portugal and Gabon. Internal security is reinforced by Angolan
 troops and Soviet and Cuban military advisors.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In its 1984 report, Amnesty International expressed concern
 about certain individual Sao Tomeans detained for alleged
 political activity. Several individuals cited by Amnesty

 SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE
 International have been released, including Albertino Neto, the
 former chief of the armed forces, who was imprisoned from 1977
 until July 1983, when he was one of nine detainees who were
 given amnesty. However, the extent to which the Government is
 cognizant of or influenced by international human rights
 organizations is not known. Freedom House rates Sao Tome *not
 free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Sao Tome economy has been based on plantation agriculture,
 particularly cacao, since the 1800's. At independence, the
 Portuguese-owned plantations, which occupied 90 percent of the
 arable land, were taken over by the Government and since then
 have been operated as state-owned enterprises. The country has
 encountered major economic problems in recent years due to the
 steady decline in both the value and volume of cacao exports,
 which represent 90 percent of total exports. This trend has
 resulted from a combination of declining world cacao prices and
 mismanagement of the state-owned plantations. Cacao
 production, which had reached 10,000 tons in 1975, is believed
 to have been about 4,000 tons in 1983. The country is
 dependent on imported foodstuffs, and the lack of foreign
 exchange in recent years has caused shortages of many staple
 foods and other consumer products. The situation became
 particularly acute in 1983 when poor rains intensified the
 long-term problems. Severe shortages of both imported staple
 foods and fruits were reported in 1983. Malnutrition was
 emerging as a problem but, with large amounts of international
 food assistance sent to Sao Tome in 1984, this now appears to
 be under control.
 The country's per capita gross domestic product, which has been
 estimated as high as $450 in the late 1970's, declined to $365
 in 1982 and is believed to have dropped to about $260 in 1983
 as a result of the steady deterioration of the economy. The
 Government has made a major effort to improve social and
 educational services. Literacy is about 50 percent and an
 estimated one-third of the student-age children are in school.
 Infant mortality statistics were reported as 63 per 1,000
 births in 1984, Life expectancy at birth for 1984 was 65.6
 years. The Government states that it provides free basic
 medical care and medicine to all citizens but reliable
 statistics to support the Government's contention are not
 available. There have been no indications of discrimination by
 sex or religion in the allocation of economic or social
 benefits under government programs in Sao Tome & Principe.
 Women have constitutional guarantees of equality, and several
 were active in public life. One senior official, the Minister
 of Foreign Affairs, is a woman. Cultural factors, rather than
 legal or political restraints, limit the actual participation
 of women in the government. The Sao Tome population is
 relatively homogeneous, and there have been no reports of a
 policy discrimination on a tribal or regional basis among Sao
 Tomean citizens. As energetic outsiders, Cape Verdeans in Sao
 Tome do suffer some informal discrimination. Members of the
 Islands' small educated class appear to enjoy advantages in
 government employment possibilities.
