 SENEGAL
 The government of Senegal has compiled an impressive human
 rights record. Senegal is a multi-party state, and its open
 society encourages a free and open debate of the important
 issues of the moment. No reports have been received of any
 significant violations of human rights in Senegal in recent
 years. Such impartial arbiters as Amnesty International
 identified no critical deficiencies in Senegalese human
 rights practices.
 Senegal is a leader among African countries in the establish-
 ment of international standards for human rights practices.
 It was the original sponsor in 1979 of the OAU Human Rights
 Charter which was adopted at the OAU Summit in Nairobi in
 June 1981. Senegal is also represented and plays a positive
 role in expanding the influence of the UN Human Rights Com-
 mission. It is the headquarters of the African Bar Associa-
 tion's Institute of Human Rights Education, a UNESCO-supported
 body which seeks to train lawyers and judges in translating
 rights into practical judicial legal procedures.
 Senegal maintained its strong commitment to human rights and
 constitutional procedure at home in 1981. Demonstrating this
 commitment to rule by law, former President Senghor voluntarily
 retired from office, to be succeeded on January 1, 1981, in a
 constitutionally prescribed manner by his long-time prime min-
 ister, Abdou Diouf. The courts' positive record in defending
 the rights of individuals and private institutions was upheld
 again in 1981, particularly with regard to disputes in the
 educational sector. The national assembly publicly reviewed
 and evaluated all government programs throughout the year.
 The limit to the number of political parties in Senegal was
 lifted, and the number of recognized parties increased from
 four to 10. Freedom of travel was enhanced with the elimina-
 tion of exit visa requirements for Senegalese citizens.
 Opposition newspapers continue to thrive.
 Senegal faces severe economic difficulties in allocating
 its very limited resources, but government programs have
 increasingly favored the rural poor. In recent years,
 Senegal has sought to diversify its economic development to
 lessen its dependence on a one-crop (peanut) economy. In
 addition, the government is following a policy of opening up
 the economy to more private sector participation and away
 from one of centralization and government control. Specific
 reforms include controls on the number and salaries of civil
 servants, and housing subsidies and stimulation of exports.
 Senegal and The Gambia have ratified a treaty of confedera-
 tion. Plans call for a combined army and police force with
 an eventual monetary union. Both nations, however, will
 retain sovereignty. It is not clear what effect, if any,
 the proposed confederation will have on observance of human
 rights in Senegal.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from
 a. Torture
 
 (210)
 
 
 211
 The constitution states that the human person is sacred and
 must be protected by the state. The criminal code specifi-
 cally prohibits physical abuse. Prohibitions against the use
 of torture are respected and enforced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The death penalty exists in Senegal for particularly heinous
 crimes but is rarely resorted to'in practice. Whipping of
 fractious prisoners is considered a legitimate punishment in
 Senegal. Prisons are far from ideal because of overcrowded
 conditions and meager fare. Chaplains, friends and family
 enjoy access to prisoners.
 c. Disappearances
 There is no record of persons being abducted, secretly arrested
 or held in clandestine detention by official or quasi-official
 security forces or by elements whose activities are condoned
 by the Senegalese government.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is forbidden by the consti-
 tution and is not practiced. The constitution guarantees
 every citizen access to legal counsel in every aspect of legal
 procedure. Habeas corpus is not incorporated into Senegalese
 law. Preventive detention is permitted when civil authorities
 determine that the threat of civil disturbance or a danger to
 the-person exists.
 a. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 Trials are fair and open to the public. Civil cases are
 presented by a prosecutor and tried before a judge. Offi-
 cials of the courts are highly trained lawyers with several
 years of required apprenticeship. Appeal cases are tried
 by a court president and two counselors. Criminal cases
 have a similar panel of Judges and at times are heard by a
 jury. The judiciary is constitutionally and effectively
 independent of the executive. Senegalese defense lawyers
 are famous throughout francophone Africa for their skills.
 Military courts are reserved for military offenders. The law
 profession is well organized and held in high regard.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 There are constitutional and legal safeguards against arbitrary
 invasion of the home. The right of property is guaranteed and
 the home is inviolable. Search warrants may be issued only by
 judges and only according to appropriate procedures outlined
 by law. A number of opposition political figures were subject
 to midnight searches of their homes by the Gendarmerie in
 September 1981 and some were detained on the grounds of
 state security.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech and intellectual inquiry are respected. The
 constitution guarantees the right of each individual to express
 
 
 212
 and disseminate his opinions freely by word of mouth, pen
 or picture. There is no discrimination based upon race,
 ethnic orgin or religion, and the Senegalese record for
 tolerance, both in law and actual practice, is excellent.
 Senegal has a vociferous and iconoclastic press, with a
 half-dozen regularly published newspapers ranging from
 politicaly conservative to Marxist-Lenist. Freedom of
 conscience and religion is constitutionally guaranteed and
 universally observed in practice. Religious institutions
 have the right to evaluate and administer their own affairs
 autonomously. The constitution authorizes citizens freely
 to assemble, and guarantees the inviolability of private
 correspondence, mail, telephone and telegraphic communica-
 tion.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The constitution states that all citizens of the Republic have
 the right to move and establish themselves freely anywhere in
 the Republic. Travel in Senegal is not restricted. In 1981
 the government abolished a requirement for exit visas for
 travel outside Senegal. The government has defined as refugees
 600,000 individuals from Guinea who have settled in Senegal
 over the past two decades. Women and men are subject to the
 same rules in matters of movement and relocation.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The constitution had limited the number of political parties
 to four and defined the ideological orientation to which
 each party adhered. The constitution was amended in 1981 to
 permit an unrestricted number of political parties with no
 ideological restrictions except that a party cannot be based
 on tribal, sectional or religious grounds. Since the amendment
 was passed, the government has registered six new parties,
 mostly of a far-left orientation, bringing the total to 10.
 Effective political power is held by the Socialist Party (PS).
 One of the recognized opposition parties, the Liberal Party
 (PDS), had 18 representatives elected to the 100-seat national
 assembly in 1978. Resignations in 1981 cut that number to 14,
 one less than the total number required to form a parliamentary
 bloc under the assembly rules of procedure. There are no
 known political exiles or prisoners.
 The rights of workers are established under the constitution.
 Workers are entitled to join trade unions and to defend their
 rights through union activities. The right to strike is
 recognized. Trade union elections have been free, with rank
 and file on occasion turning established labor leaders out of
 office. Equal employment opportunity is legally assured for
 women, but lack of training or of previous employment experi-
 ence, as well as traditional views about the role of women in
 society, hamper achievement in practice.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The official press in Senegal has urged that the principle of
 nonintervention not be used to protect violators of human
 
 
 213
 rights. Senegal has taken the lead in proposing an African
 charter for human rights which would set-up a supranational
 commission for human rights surveillance in Africa. Through
 the National Committee on Human Rights, the government
 supports popular education in human rights.
 No requests have been made by international or nongovernmental
 organizations to investigate alleged human rights violations
 in Senegal.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 According to the World Bank, per capita GNP in Senegal has
 increased from $240 in 1970 to $430 in 1979. Government
 policies have sought to improve income and employment levels
 over the long run through rehabilitation of the national
 economy. The president cited this as one of his top prio-
 rities in his inaugural address of January 1. Particular
 emphasis is placed on exploiting the natural resources
 associated with Senegal's river systems to improve the lot
 of the rural poor.
 Labor legislation in Senegal incorporates high rates of
 welfare benefits. In 1981 wages were raised seven percent
 across the board, a figure which probably does not keep pace
 with the national rate of inflation.
 Senegal is a developing country, the efforts of which in
 combatting deficient health and nutritional conditions are
 undercut by limited resources. According to World Bank
 statistics, life expectancy has increased over the last
 decade to a still low 42.1 average years. When last mea-
 sured in 1972 the infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births
 stood at 159. The total fertility rate is calculated at 6.5
 percent, and the actual population growth rate at 2.6 percent
 over the last decade. Only 37 percent of Senegal's people
 have access to safe water--68 percent in urban areas and only
 23 percent in rural regions. 'The government is making a
 major effort to increase domestic agricultural production and
 improve the daily diet of its citizens through development
 projects in irrigated rice growing, livestock production, and
 pisciculture. Efforts at family planning have been modest
 because of local religious scruples.
 Senegal is widely recognized as having the most highly deve-
 loped system of higher education in francophone Africa. In
 1981, the government made a major commitment to strengthening
 and popularizing its primary and secondary educational system.
 In his inaugural speech, President Diouf characterized educa-
 tion as one of his government's top two priorities and called
 for immediate reforms. A national convention of interested
 parties proposed sweeping changes in the educational system
 which would spread the benefits of education and deemphasize
 its elitist character. The reforms were largely adopted by
 the government. Host prominent among the changes was the
 government's open-ended commitment to the goal of universal
 education for all children up to 16 years of age. Other
 significant changes involve the reduction or elimination of
 central support to prestige or elitist schools and the
 improvement of teaching working conditions.
 The need for reform is reflected in World Bank statistics
 which show an increase in adjusted primary school enroll-
 ment from 38 to 41 percent of the total eligible children in
 the 10-year period ending in 1979. Adult literacy was
 estimated at 10 percent in 1979.
