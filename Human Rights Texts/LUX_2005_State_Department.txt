One of the country's three justices of the peace has jurisdiction over minor criminal, civil, and commercial cases, and one of two district courts heard more serious cases. The youth and guardianship court ruled on matters concerning the protection of young persons. An administrative court system reviewed citizen challenges to legislation.

The law prohibits domestic violence, and the government effectively enforced it. The law is gender neutral and provides that a batterer will be removed from the house for 10 days; this can be extended an additional 3 months. Police are responsible for pursuing the charges so that a victim cannot be intimidated into dropping charges. Penalties may include fines and imprisonment. If a person asks an NGO for assistance, the police must act proactively and to speak with the person. There were approximately 300 cases of police intervention relating to spousal abuse and 154 expulsions by the police of the abusing spouse. There is a hotline for battered women. During the year government-sponsored NGO shelters provided refuge to approximately 450 women and 500 children. In addition, the government provided financial assistance to domestic violence victims.

The government funded organizations that provided shelter, counseling, and hotlines. The law specifically prohibits rape, including spousal rape, and stipulates penalties ranging between 5 and 19 years' imprisonment; the government enforced these laws effectively. There was a reported average of about ten rape cases per year. Prostitution is legal, but the activities associated with organized prostitution, such as profiting from, aiding or abetting prostitutes are punishable by law. There have been no reports of police targeting prostitutes for abuse. There were reports that women were trafficked to the country for sexual exploitation (see section 5). Law prohibits sexual harassment, and the government generally enforced it. Under the law, women enjoy the same rights as men, including rights under family law, property law, and in the judicial system.

The Ministry of Equal Opportunity is responsible for protecting the legal and social rights of women. Children The government was strongly committed to children's rights and welfare. The law mandates school attendance from 4 through 15 years of age, and school attendance is universal through that age.

The government's hotline for young persons in distress received 370 calls during the year. Trafficking in Persons The law prohibits trafficking in persons; however, the country was a destination for women trafficked from Eastern Europe for the purpose of sexual exploitation. There were two confirmed reports of trafficking reported during the year. The law provides penalties from six months' to three years' imprisonment and monetary fines for trafficking. If there are aggravating circumstances, prison sentences can range from 1 to 10 years' imprisonment. The government effectively enforced the antitrafficking statutes. The Ministry of Justice with the involvement of the ministries of foreign affairs and equal opportunity as well as NGOs was responsible for the government's antitrafficking efforts. The prosecution of the one 2004 trafficking case was ongoing at year's end. There were no government services specifically for victims of trafficking; however, two NGOs, which were fully financed by the government, provided shelter and counseling assistance to women in distress. There were no government prevention programs specifically targeting trafficking at year's end. Persons with Disabilities The law prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities in employment, education, access to health care, or in the provision of other state services, and the government effectively enforced these provisions. The law does not require accessibility for persons with disabilities, but the government paid subsidies to builders to construct "disabledfriendly" structures. Despite these government incentives, only a small proportion of buildings and public transportation vehicles have been modified to accommodate persons with disabilities. Aid for Handicapped Children, an NGO, is in charge of protecting the rights of persons with disabilities. The government acknowledged that laws establishing quotas requiring businesses that employ over 25 persons to hire workers with disabilities and pay them prevailing wages were not applied or enforced consistently, and there was a particular problem in the case of persons with mental disabilities. Section 6 Worker Rights a. The Right of Association The law provides for the right to form and join unions of their choice without previous authorization or excessive requirements, and workers exercised these rights in practice. Approximately 50 percent of the workforce (including the trans-border workers) was unionized. b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively The law allows unions to conduct their activities without interference, and the government protected this right in practice. The law provides for the right to collective bargaining, and workers exercised this right freely. Approximately 66 percent of workers are under collective bargaining agreements. The law provides for the right to strike, except for government workers who provide essential services, but no strikes occurred during the year. Legal strikes may occur only after a lengthy conciliation procedure between the parties. The government's national conciliation office must certify that conciliation efforts have ended for a strike to be legal. There are no export processing zones. c. Prohibition of Forced or Bonded Labor The law prohibits forced or compulsory labor, including by children, and there were no reports that such practices occurred. d. Prohibition of Child Labor and Minimum Age for Employment The government effectively implemented laws and policies to protect children from exploitation in the workplace. The law prohibits the employment of children under the age of 16. Apprentices who are 16 years old must attend school in addition to their job training. Workers under the age of 18 have additional legal protection, including limits on overtime and the number of hours that can be worked continuously. The ministries of labor and education effectively enforced the child labor laws. e. Acceptable Conditions of Work The national minimum wage for a single worker over the age of 18 was approximately $1,390 (1,670 euros) per month for unskilled workers and approximately $1,475 (1,770 euros) per month for skilled workers. The minimum wage was not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family; however, most employees earned more than the minimum wage. The law mandates a maximum workweek of 40 hours. Premium pay is required for overtime or unusual hours. Sunday employment is permitted in continuous-process industries (steel, glass, and chemicals) and for certain maintenance and security personnel; other industries must request permission for Sunday work, which the government granted on a case-by-case basis. Work on Sunday, allowed for some retail employees, must be entirely voluntary and compensated at double the normal wage, or with compensatory time off on another day, equal to the number of hours worked on Sunday. The law requires rest breaks for shift workers and limits all workers to a maximum of 10 hours per day including overtime. If employers did not honor the law, workers may successively ask for assistance at the labor inspection court and then the Superior Court of Justice The law mandates a safe working environment. An inspection system provided severe penalties for infractions. The labor inspectorate of the ministry of labor and the accident insurance agency of the social security ministry carried out effective inspections. No laws or regulations specifically provided workers with the right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to their continued employment; however, every worker has the right to ask the labor inspectorate to make a determination regarding workplace safety, and the inspectorate usually did so expeditiously.  HYPERLINK "http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2005/61661.htm" Back to Top
