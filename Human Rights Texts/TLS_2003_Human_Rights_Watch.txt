EAST TIMOR
East Timor became the world’s newest country on May 20 and was admitted
as the 191st member of the United Nations by the General Assembly on
September 27. East Timor’s new constitution included important human rights
protections and, with the support of the United Nations, the government took
important steps forward in a number of areas including policing. Despite the historic
changes, however, systemic problems remained in the criminal justice system,
and several critical issues, including the scope of a much discussed amnesty for past
abuses, remained unresolved.At this writing there were also still an estimated thirty
thousand East Timorese refugees in camps in West Timor. (See Indonesia.)
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
2002 was a year of political milestones in East Timor. On March 22, 2002, the
Constituent Assembly, elected in 2001, approved the country’s first constitution.
The constitution incorporated the protection of human rights as a state objective
and enshrined several basic political and civil rights in the text. These included the
right to a fair trial, criminal due process, freedom of expression, freedom of association,
and freedom of religion. The constitution also expressly forbid the death
penalty or life imprisonment, and included the rights to be free from torture, servitude,
and cruel or degrading treatment.
However, the constitution remained unclear on the position of minorities,
including non-citizens, and omitted some social and economic rights as well as the
right to be free from discrimination based on one’s sexual orientation.
On April 14, East Timor held its first presidential elections. The elections, generally
held to be free and fair by both the East Timor Independent Electoral Commission
and national and international observer groups, were contested by
Francisco Xavier do Amaral,who captured 17.3 percent of the votes, and Independence
leader Xanana Gusmao,who won with an overwhelming 82.7 percent of the
votes.
Finally, at 12:01 a.m. on May 20, 2002, pursuant to Security Council Resolution
1392 (2002), East Timor declared its independence in a ceremony attended by over
120,000 East Timorese, foreign dignitaries, and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan. Later that same day, East Timor swore in its first government and held an
inaugural session of parliament. The date also signified the end of the U.N. Transitional
Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) and the start of its successor mission,
the U.N.Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET).
Justice
Justice for atrocities committed under Indonesian rule and for continuing
everyday crimes raised some of the most pressing rights issues for UNTAET, for the East Timor Transitional Administration set up under its auspices, and for the independent
East Timorese government after May 20. On December 11, 2001, the
Special Panel for Serious Crimes of the Dili District Court (Special Panel) issued its
verdict in the first case to be tried in East Timor alleging crimes against humanity.
The Special Panel, consisting of two international judges and one East Timorese
judge, had been set up to hear cases from the Serious Crimes Investigations Unit
(SCIU), a body established pursuant to Security Council Resolution 1272 to examine
incidents of mass killings and forced deportation as well as individual offences
of murder, rape, torture, and other crimes committed in East Timor between January
1, 1999 and October 25, 1999. It is estimated that at least one thousand civilians
were directly targeted and killed prior to and after the August 30, 1999
referendum in East Timor.Approximately 250,000 East Timorese were also forcibly
expelled to West Timor in September 1999. (The SCIU and the Special Panel continued
to operate in East Timor after independence, under the auspices of
UNMISET.)
In its December 11, 2001 verdict, the Special Panel found ten militia members
guilty of crimes against humanity on a number of different underlying charges,
including torture,murder, and forced expulsion. The cases, which alleged systematic
burning of homes and forced relocations of populations across the border into
Indonesian territory, as well as murders by members of the Tim Alpha militia in Los
Palos District in 1999,were significant in establishing that a state of armed conflict
existed in East Timor in 1999; that the local militia had been used by the Indonesian
army’s Special Forces (Komando Pasukan Khusus, Kopassus) in pre-planned,
systematic attacks on unarmed civilians following Indonesia’s defeat in the referendum;
and that Indonesian military and civil administrators were responsible for
the violence and forced expulsions.The Special Panel further found that the defendants
were aware of the systematic campaign against the population and must have
known that their actions contributed to it.
By September 2002, the Office of the General Prosecutor had filed thirty-nine
indictments involving 117 defendants, eight of them Indonesian nationals, for
crimes against humanity committed in East Timor.However, Indonesia continued
to refuse to cooperate with transfers of witnesses, suspects, and evidence, refusals
interpreted by UNTAET as a violation of the Memorandum of Understanding
between the Republic of Indonesia and UNTAET regarding co-operation in legal,
judicial, and human rights matters.
With its December 11, 2001 verdict, the Special Panel was believed to have
become the first court worldwide to apply laws originally formulated for the International
Criminal Court (ICC). (The ICC language had been incorporated into
East Timor’s criminal code.) On September 6, 2002, East Timor acceded to the ICC.
Although the verdict and indictments were important steps forward in East
Timor’s quest for justice, serious concerns remained about the work of the Special
Panel and the SCIU.The Los Palos case itself raised concerns regarding due process.
While prosecutors included experienced international criminal lawyers from the
SCIU, the defense was provided by staff members from East Timor’s drastically
under-resourced and inexperienced Public Defenders’ Office. In all, three international
lawyers and three East Timorese lawyers defended the ten accused, thereby
denying them access to separate defense counsel and raising potential conflicts of interest. Neither the East Timorese nor the international defenders had any previous
experience in crimes against humanity trials. There were additional problems
of continuity of representation: four of the accused had their final statements read
by someone who had not represented them at trial.
Systematic problems remained in other parts of the justice system. These
included a backlog of cases, inadequate and inexperienced defense counsel, lack of
resources, and unfilled vacancies for public defenders and judges. Judicial vacancies
slowed both trials and appeals. A lack of qualified interpreters exacerbated the
problem, contributing to delays, interruptions, and disputes over testimony during
proceedings.
There was also administrative mismanagement. On May 20, the contracts of a
number of judges and prosecutors expired. Renewals of appointment were originally
intended to be conditioned on satisfactory performance reviews, but those
reviews could not take place as there was neither a functioning review body nor had
relevant criteria been established to guide the reviews. A further complicating factor
was that the new constitution called for a judicial council to take over responsibility
for appointment of judges, but the council was not established until mid-July.
While the government argued that judges still had the authority to hear cases, a
number of judges argued that they lacked official jurisdiction, and the system effectively
ground to a halt from late May until mid-July.The matter was finally resolved
by a presidential decree stipulating the continuation of judicial appointments.
In early June, the entire court system shut down when all judges, prosecutors,
and public defenders were required to attend compulsory legal training on the constitution
and civil law issues. No personnel were available to review detentions.
Between ten and thirty suspects were released from Caicoli police station in Dili
alone, because they had been held beyond the seventy-two hour legal limit.
Concerns with the prison system also continued in 2002.Although physical conditions
for detainees were generally adequate, lengthy pre-trial detentions, illegal
detentions due to expired warrants, and overcrowding remained important concerns.
Civil society groups also expressed concern about government failure to
monitor individuals on conditional release to ensure that they were adhering to the
terms of their release.
Detained children continued to be housed with adults but had their own cell
blocks. There were complaints that children were at times held for lengthy periods
without justification.At this writing,one child reportedly had been held in pre-trial
detention since October 2001 for a traffic accident in which a young child was accidentally
killed.
Other serious crimes, including rape and domestic violence, consistently were
referred to traditional customary law mechanisms rather than to the courts. Such
mechanisms lacked basic due process protections and were criticized by a number
of East Timorese groups for failing to provide justice for victims, especially victims
of sexual violence.
The East Timorese Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation
(CRTR) was established on January 21, 2002 when seven national commissioners
were sworn in. The commission was to work for two years to document human
rights violations committed between April 1974 and October 1999 in East Timor, and to facilitate community reconciliation. In April, thirty regional commissioners
were sworn in. A pilot project to take victim statements was undertaken on Atauro
Island and commissioners collected thirty-three statements from victims of murder,
torture, rape, and forced displacement.At the end of August, the CRTR carried
out its first community reconciliation program in Maumeta.
In July, a draft amnesty law for perpetrators of the 1999 violence was presented
to the parliament for debate. There was confusion over provisions defining who
would be eligible for amnesty and whether the law would treat members of the East
Timorese resistance more leniently than pro-Indonesia East Timorese, thereby
undermining the principle of equal protection under the law. At this writing, the
bill was stalled in parliament after much external and internal criticism of the draft.
Officers from the East Timorese Police Service (ETPS) gradually took over
responsibilities from U.N. Police (UNPOL) officers throughout the year, but continued
to be under-resourced. A growing number of complaints over the course of
the year against members of ETPS highlighted the urgent need for a mechanism to
investigate allegations of human rights violations by police officers and to impose
disciplinary measures where appropriate.At this writing, allegations of misconduct
continued to be investigated on an ad hoc basis by the UNPOL Professional Standards
Unit; recommendations regarding disciplinary action were the responsibility
of ETPS.
In January, East Timor Defense Force (FALINTIL-ETDF) troops replaced U.N.
peacekeepers in Lautem district. The transition appeared to go smoothly although
concerns remained about the lack of an internal disciplinary measure for soldiers
committing abuses. Several cases of alleged rape by newly deployed ETDF officers
were reported during the year.
At year’s end there were still approximately thirty thousand East Timorese
refugees in Indonesia, including approximately 1,500 reported missing and separated
children. (See Indonesia.)
The uncertain legal status of habitual residents (ethnically non-Timorese residents
who had lived in East Timor for five or more years directly proceeding the
popular consultation) became an issue several times during the year following
threats to returnee Indonesian families, who had fled or been forcibly removed
from East Timor to Indonesian territory following the referendum in 1999. Such
individuals received no legal status from the constitution, although a draft citizenship
bill contained provisions that would enable long-term non-Timorese residents
to stay in the country. Ethnic Timorese who returned from Indonesia in 2002
were generally well received with lower than expected levels of intimidation and
violence toward them.
During the year dozens of foreign nationals applied for asylum in East Timor.At
this writing, none had been granted refugee status by UNHCR in Dili. In the largest
case a group of fifty-eight Sri Lankans arrived in East Timor by boat on July 28.
Although they initially applied for asylum, all eventually decided to be repatriated
back to Sri Lanka by the International Organization of Migration (IOM). Most
rejected asylum claimants remained in East Timor with the status of undocumented
migrants. Although IOM offered assistance to those wishing to return to
their country of origin, some refused to do so, maintaining it was unsafe.With East Timor’s immigration services understaffed and under-resourced, it appeared that
such individuals, including at least six Russians, tens of Indonesians, and several
Vietnamese were destined to remain in legal limbo indefinitely.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
This year there were no attacks on human rights defenders in East Timor.
Human rights organizations and activists operated freely and continued to play an
active role in lobbying UNTAET, UNMISET, the Constituent Assembly, government
institutions, and the new parliament.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
Following East Timor’s independence on May 20, the U.N. General Assembly
removed East Timor from its list of non-self-governing territories.U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan named Kamalesh Sharma as the new special representative
(SRSG), and Sukehiro Hasegawa as deputy SRSG.
In August, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson made
her last official visit to East Timor. She announced plans for a two-year technical
coordination and cooperation program between the OHCHR and the East Timorese
government and signed a joint communiqué on human rights with Senior
Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, José Ramos-Horta, and the chairperson
of the NGO Forum, Cecilio Caminha Freitas.
During her stay she also publicly denounced the verdicts in the first East Timor
trials from the Jakarta ad hoc tribunal and called for an international tribunal to be
set up to provide justice for the East Timorese.
The first act of East Timor’s new parliament was to reaffirm the U.N. Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. On September 27 East Timor became an official
member of the U.N.
On September 6, 2002, East Timor acceded to the Rome Statute of the ICC. In
response to U.S. pressure (which included withdrawal of three U.S. military
observers from UNMISET in July), however, foreign minister Ramos-Horta agreed
not to turn over U.S. government employees or nationals to the ICC. East Timor
was only the third nation to sign such a “Article 98” agreement with the U.S.At this
writing, the agreement had not yet been ratified by parliament.
World Bank
In May, a World Bank-sponsored donors meeting in Dili resulted in U.S.$360
million in foreign aid pledges from more than twenty-five participating countries.
Speaking at the conference, bank country director Klaus Rohland urged donors to
continue support for the next two to three years.
On August 28, a donor conference took place in Dili to assess the needs of East
Timor’s security forces, which were due to take over from U.N. peacekeepers in
2004. Australia, the U.S., New Zealand, South Korea, and Portugal had been the
main donors to the East Timor Defense Force.
Australia
True to Prime Minister Howard’s affirmation of the two nations as “partners in
this part of the world,” one of East Timor’s first acts as an independent nation was
the signing of a treaty with Australia to divide oil and gas revenues.Because income
from the deal, 90 percent of which will go to East Timor, was not due to begin to
flow until 2005, Australia together with other major foreign donors continued to
provide financial support for the new state. It allocated $19.75 million (Aus$36 million)
for the 2002-2003 fiscal year for poverty reduction and capacity-building programs
for government and public administration. Australians also constituted
roughly 25 percent of the United Nations peacekeeping force.
United States
The Bush administration gave strong financial backing to independent East
Timor but the administration did little to promote accountability by Indonesian
security forces for abuses in East Timor.
With strong bipartisan support from Congress, USAID funding for fiscal year
2002 totaled $25 million for economic and democracy programs; it requested $19
million for 2003.
Europe
The E.U. took the lead in negotiating a chairman’s consensus statement on East
Timor at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva in April. The statement
was congratulatory of the steps East Timor had taken to establish human
rights protections, including incorporating rights in line with the Universal Declaration
into the new constitution, and it encouraged further progress, notably
efforts to bring to justice perpetrators of the 1999 violence and cooperation
between East Timor and Indonesia.
The European Commission promised Û9 million (roughly U.S.$8.8 million) in
reconstruction assistance for 2002, as part of a three-year, 290 million euro contribution
to the World Bank-administered trust fund for East Timor.Additional allocations
totaled Û27 million (roughly U.S.$26.6 million) for the health system and
food aid. In late May, the commission adopted a five-year strategy for financial aid
to East Timor,prioritizing support of the health sector and rural development,with
Û46 million (roughly U.S.$45.4 million) in grants earmarked for the 2002-2004
period.
Portugal independently promised in December 2001 aid totaling Û100 million
(U.S.$98.7 million) to its former colony.
Indonesia
Reconciliation began slowly with the former occupier.Despite opposition from
some members of parliament, President Megawati traveled to Dili for the May
independence ceremony, in a clear symbolic gesture of support for normalized
relations between Jakarta and East Timor. After visiting the graves of Indonesian
soldiers killed during the occupation,Megawati briefly attended the independence
ceremony and, despite cheers from the crowd, looked uncomfortable as President
Xanana held her hand in the air. The presence of Indonesian naval vessels off shore
during the ceremony undercut the message of solidarity.
Japan
Japan continued to provide economic support to East Timor and pledged in
February to send 690 peacekeepers to East Timor to work primarily on engineering
and construction projects. Japan’s ambassador to the U.N. noted his country was
the largest direct assistance donor, with U.S.$120 million for development and
humanitarian aid, and a promise of $190 million over the next three years. Japan
also vowed to contribute $1 million to the new Commission for Reception, Truth
and Reconciliation, $19 million in emergency aid through the United Nations
Development Program’s Community Development and Rehabilitation (CDR)
projects, and $5.3 million to help East Timorese refugees in West Timor.
