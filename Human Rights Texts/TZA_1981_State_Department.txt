 TANZANIA
 According ï¿½o the Tanzanian credo of:-governance and the
 leaders who shaped and implement it, the paramount
 objective of the state is to secure the basic economic
 and social well-being of the masses. While political rights
 .are not.completely subordinated to this goal, the government
 does not encourage the sort of political interplay which
 characterizes.Western democracies. The government and,
 increasingly, the country's sole .political party control the
 substance and tone of public debate on political issues. In
 many respects, however, Tanzanian society remains open.
 Through-readers' letters to the press, parliamentary
 debates,.a party structure that, reaches all of society,
 .and personal encounters in the hundreds of bars and coffee
 houses throughout the country, the leadership is made aware
 of the people's concern& and complaints. While there have
 been documented cases of violations of human rights in the
 past,  there is evidence-that such abuses have, over the past
 .few years, declined in number and severity. Tanzanian
 leaders -fromthe president-on down have publicly and
 often committed themselves to ensuring fair, equal and
 humane treatment for the citizenry. Those few officials
 who breach these commitments are excoriated in the press,
 prosecuted in proceedings open to the public and widely.
 reported by the:media and, if found guilty, given stiff
 prison sentences.
 1. Respect-for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The Tanzanian Government does not sanction the use of
 -torture by its police,security and prison officials,
 though there are -reports that low-level enforcement
 officers-sometimes abuse-detainees. Where there have
 :been instances of torture, the victims are entitled to,
 and:in somei-stances have exercised, the right-to file
 criminal assault suits against alleged tormenters. In
 July 1980, four former security and police officers
 wera-sentenced to seven years imprisonment for man-
 ,slaughter.in .a-case involving the 1976 deaths of two
 -suspects .who-were tortured.
 Allegations of police-brutality.appear in the press from
 time to time, as did a full account of the torture trials
 mentioned above,-indicating that such practices are not
 officially.approved.
 Under law,.a:confession must be heard by a magistrate, and
 one obtained in any other way must be restated in court.
 -b. Cruel,'Inhuman-or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 STanzanian prisons are overcrowded and dietary and
 health standards are inadequate. These shortcomings
 reflect-the general.underdevelopmentof the country as a
 -whole and do not constitute a conscious attempt by the
 government to punish wrongdoers by depriving them of
 basic necessities. There is no evidence of discrimina-
 tion.against detainees on the basis of sex, social
 class, ethnic origin or religion.

 c.   Disappearances
 The government does not always notify relatives or, in
 the cases of foreigners, consular representatives, of
 arrests. In Tanzania communications are so poor that
 such notifications are difficult if not sometimes
 impossible. It is also likely that few police offi-
 cials in the countryside even know of their obligations
 in this regard. There have been no reported cases of
 "permanent disappearance."
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Under the Preventive Detention Act of 1962, police
 and security officials can, with a written order from
 the president of the republic, arrest and detain indef-
 initely any individual deemed dangerous to public order
 or national security. Such detainees have no recourse
 to the judicial system once the authorities produce a
 valid detention order before a magistrate. There have
 been cases, however, where officials could not or would
 not produce the required presidential order, and the
 courts have freed the detainees (such as in January,
 when several Asian businessmen implicated in the illegal
 purchase of a cargo ship were detained and then released).
 Under the act, a committee was established to oversee
 the interests and treatment of detainees. The committee,
 however, reportedly functions only sporadically.
 There is no reliable estimate on the number of persons
 presently detained under the act. In April 1981, ten
 Zanzibaris detained under the act, but never formally
 charged for allegedly plotting to overthrow the Zanzibari
 president (who is also vice president of Tanzania), were
 released. At least six Zanzibaris remained in detention
 for participation in the same alleged plot. According
 to Amnesty International's 1981 report the government has
 not responded to its requests for information about the
 remaining detainees.
 a.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Criminal trials are open to the public and the more
 egregious cases receive wide play in the media. While
 an independent judiciary is constitutionally mandated,
 sources in the legal community, including some in the
 judiciary itself, have complained that the legal system
 is being corrupted through professional inducements and
 illegal monetary payments to officers of the courts.
 These irregularities have not been documented. In all
 serious cases (defined as treason, murder and man-
 slaughter) defendants are provided counsel. The
 Tanzania Law Association offers free assistance in
 other types of cases. Tanzanian lawyers have protested
 a government proposal which would, in effect, nationalize
 the legal profession. The legal profession argues
 that, among other things, such a move would deny litigants
 the right to choose legal counsel freely. The proposal
 has been postponed.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Search warrants are legally required in Tanzania. There
 are unverified reports that homes of suspected opponents
 
 
 281
 of the government and alleged violators of exchange and
 price control regulations were subject to illegal searches
 in 1981.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Public criticism of Tanzania's commitment to socialist
 methods and goals continues to be discouraged strongly
 -but complaints about specific government actions frequently
 appear in letters to local newspapers. Criticism in
 private-is free with little apparent attempt by the
 government or party to limit it. Inducements to conform
 are economic and social in nature and, in recent years at
 least, do not include physical coercion. The government
 exercises de facto control over the media, which present a
 single point of view on important policy matters. The
 press this year has become bolder in its investigative
 reporting, especially regarding activities of government-
 owned quasi-governmental corporations and Tanzania's
 depressed economy. Foreign books and periodicals do
 circulate but few.Tanzanians can afford them. A pamphlet
 .criticizing the party, published in-country under a
 pseudonym, was distributed in book stores and received
 wide notice, even in the official media. Although freedom
 of inquiry .is officially guaranteed, most academicians,
 who depend on the government-run education system for
 their livelihoods, are cautious in their selection and
 treatment of socio-political topics.
 All legal political gatherings are organized by the coun-
 try's.sole political party, the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (revo-
 lutionary.party, or CCM). The government controls union
 activity through its umbrella labor federation, and strikes
 areprohibited by. law. Pew professional associations exist
 .and those:that do are careful to stay clear of political
 entanglements.
 .Tanzania observes complete freedom of religion. The
 majority of those persons claiming membership in an organ-
 ized-religion are.Christian'but a significant minority,
 .about thirty percent, are adherents of Islam. There appear
 to be no advantages or disadvantages associated with member-
 ship in any faith or sect.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 .Travel,'Emigration and Repatriation
 The government-places no restriction on travel within
 the country, nor are there any formal limitations on
 the freedom of residence. Through economic inducements
 and efforts to improve life in the countryside, the
 -government does try to discourage flight to urban areas.
 The Ivillagization program,! under which peasants were
 compelled, sometimes physically, to move to permanent
 -settlements, was completed in 1978. Some six million
 people were moved under this program. Some residents of
 new villages have since chosen to return to their original
 lands, apparently-without.government attempts to interfere.
 Tanzania does not infringe upon the right of voluntary
 repatriation. Passports-are required for foreign travel
 and, reportedly, are difficult to obtain the government
 
 
 282
 contends that its policy in this regard is dictated more
 by a desire to husband scarce foreign exchange than by the
 intention to limit travel per se. Emigration is not
 otherwise restricted.
 Tanzania is presently home to about 160,000 refugees,
 75 percent of whom are from Burundi. There are also
 some 36,000 Rwandan refugees to whom Tanzania has
 offered citizenship. With support from the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and several
 private voluntary organizations, the government has
 given these people a standard of living at least
 comparable to that enjoyed by Tanzanians. There is no
 evidence of discrimination against women or other
 groups in the implementation of government policies on
 refugees, travel or emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political activity is permissible only within the CCM.
 There are no overt opposition groups. One-half of the
 parliament is elected under a system of universal
 adult suffrage. The remainder is appointed by the
 government and by various mass organizations associated
 with the CCM. While any citizen is free to enter the
 primary contests, the national executive committee of
 the CCM chooses the two candidates for each constituency
 who will compete in the general election. Voters
 frequently register their dissatisfaction with the
 "ins' by sending incumbents down to defeat. Tanzanian
 voters threw out of office nearly half of the 84
 members of parliament who stood for election in 1980.
 The turnover in parliamentary seats may reflect
 popular disenchantment with current economic conditions
 and with the government's inability, so far, to bring
 about changes for the better. The president of the
 republic is also directly elected although, in the four
 elections since independence, Julius Nyerere has been
 the only candidate for the post. Voters can register
 their discontent by staying home or marking the "no*
 box on the secret ballot. Women have been encouraged
 to take an active role in politics and government.
 Using its powers of direct appointment, the government
 has seen to it that about 20 percent of the membership
 of village councils is female. There are two female
 members of the cabinet and four women on the thirty-
 member central committee of the CCM. Women still are under-
 represented in proportion to their numbers at all levels
 of the system, as tradition, customs and attitudes
 that discriminate against women remain strong.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Tanzania has not been asked to consent to an investiga-
 tion by any recognized human rights organization.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Tanzania is among the poorest countries in the world
 with an estimated per capita GNP of $260. Ten percent
 of the urban population and sixty percent of the rural
 population are below the absolute poverty level. The
 
 
 283
 government continued in 1981 to pursue an egalitarian,
 socialist model of development aimed at expanding
 public services to meet the basic needs of Tanzania's
 largely rural population. About $830 million is
 budgeted for development programs in 1982, some 35
 percent of the total budget.
 The economy overall has suffered the strains of world-
 wide inflation, rising energy costs, unstable prices
 and declining production in the export sector, and
 decreases in the output of manufactured products,
 primarily due to an inability to finance imports of raw
 .materials and spare parts. Two years of drought has
 curtailed-harvests. Severe food shortages have been
 averted only with the timely assistance of grain
 surplus countries, including the United States. The
 government is committed to improving the dietary
 standards of the population and has undertaken, often
 with foreign assistance, ambitious programs in mother
 and child feeding and public education in nutrition.
 The government has also continued efforts to expand
 education and health facilities. Nearly 3.5 million
 pupils attend primary schools, representing over 70
 percent of the school-age population. Public secondary
 school enrollment totals 42,000. Adult education
 efforts are also emphasized and contribute greatly to
 Tanzania's relatively high literacy rate, an estimated
 80 percent. Medical care is accorded a high priority by
 the 'government and, though programs suffer shortages of
 resources and personnel, basic health standards
 are improving, particularly in the countryside.
 Government health efforts concentrate on the provision
 of basic health services through village level dispens-
 aries. Community health programs designed to provide
 safe drinking water, adequate sanitation and the eradi-
 cation of disease-bearing pests are also important,
 although malaria, bilharzia, cholera and various enteric
 diseases are still prevalent. Since independence in
 1961, life expectancy has risen from 42 to 51 years.
 Over the last ten years, infant mortality has decreased
 20 percent to 125 per thousand live births. Thirty-
 nine percent of the population now has access to clean
 water.
 Over ninety percent of Tanzania's population lives in
 rural areas. In urban centers, such as Dar es Salaam,
 unemployment and underemployment are serious problems,
 though no figures are available to demonstrate of what
 magnitude.
