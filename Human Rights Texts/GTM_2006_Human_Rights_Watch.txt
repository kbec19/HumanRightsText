Guatemala
Nearly two decades after the return of civilian rule, Guatemala has made little
progress toward securing the protection of human rights and the rule of
law, essential features of a functioning democracy. Impunity remains the rule
when it comes to human rights abuses. Ongoing acts of political violence and
intimidation threaten to reverse the little progress that has been made toward
promoting accountability in recent years.
Impunity
Guatemala continues to suffer the effects of an internal armed conflict that
ended in 1996. A U.N.-sponsored truth commission estimated that as many
as 200,000 people were killed during the thirty-six-year war and attributed
the vast majority of the killings to government forces.
As Human Rights Watch has noted in the past, Guatemalans seeking
accountability for these abuses face daunting obstacles. The prosecutors and
investigators who handle these cases receive grossly inadequate training and
resources. The courts routinely fail to resolve judicial appeals and motions in
an expeditious manner, allowing defense attorneys to engage in dilatory legal
maneuvering. The army and other state institutions fail to cooperate fully
with investigations into abuses committed by current or former members.
The police do not provide adequate protection to judges, prosecutors, and
witnesses involved in politically sensitive cases.
Of the 626 massacres documented by the truth commission, only one case
has been successfully prosecuted in the Guatemalan courts. In 2004, a lieutenant
and thirteen soldiers were found guilty of the 1995 Xamán massacre
in which eleven civilians were killed; they were each sentenced to forty years
in prison. By contrast, the prosecution of former military officers allegedly
responsible for the 1982 Dos Erres massacre, in which 162 people died, has
been held up for years by dilatory defense motions.
The few other convictions obtained in human rights cases have come at considerable
cost. In the case of Myrna Mack, an anthropologist who was assassinated in 1990, it took over a decade to obtain the conviction of an army
colonel, Valencia Osorio, for his role in orchestrating the killing. During that
time, a police investigator who gathered incriminating evidence was murdered,
and two other investigators—as well as three witnesses—received
threats and fled the country. Osorio, meanwhile, escaped police custody and
has not served his sentence.
Attacks and Threats by “Clandestine Groups”
Over the past four years, there have been an alarming number of attacks and
threats against Guatemalans seeking justice for past abuses. The targets have
included human rights advocates, justice officials, forensic experts, and plaintiffs
and witnesses involved in human rights cases. They have also included
journalists, labor activists, and others who have denounced abuses of authority.
In January 2005, Guatemala’s Human Rights Ombudsman reported a plot to
assassinate Bishop Álvaro Ramazzini, who has been an outspoken voice on
social and economic issues. In March, radio journalist Marielos Monzón, who
had broadcast special programs on recent clashes between police and indigenous
protestors, reported that an anonymous caller had told her to “[s]top
defending those stinking Indians, you bitch, or we will kill you.” In August,
members of the Guatemalan Foundation for Forensic Anthropology received
repeated death threats, apparently due to their work exhuming bodies buried
in clandestine cemeteries throughout the country.
There is a widespread consensus among local and international observers that
the people responsible for these acts of intimidation are affiliated with private,
secretive, and illegally armed networks or organizations, commonly
referred to in Guatemala as “clandestine groups.” These groups appear to
have links to both state agents and organized crime—which give them access
to considerable political and economic resources. The Guatemalan justice
system, which has little ability even to contain common crime, has so far
proven no match for this powerful and dangerous threat to the rule of law.

Despite pressure from civil society, in 2005 the Guatemalan Congress failed
to pass legislation that would have regulated work conditions for domestic
workers by setting minimum salary standards, limiting permissible work
hours, and protecting against sexual harassment.
Key International Actors
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights opened an
office in Guatemala in 2005 to provide observation and technical assistance
on human rights practices (a role that the United Nations Verification
Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA) had played for nearly a decade, until it
closed its operations in December 2004).
No progress has been made toward implementing the 2004 agreement
between Guatemala and the United Nations to establish a special commission
to investigate and promote the prosecution of “clandestine groups.” The
Commission for the Investigation of Illegal Groups and Clandestine Security
Organizations (CICIACS) grew out of a proposal developed by the
Guatemalan government and local human rights groups, in consultation with
members of the international community. The Guatemalan Congress has
never ratified the agreement, and the country’s Constitutional Court has held
that several of its provisions are unconstitutional. The current government
has said it would propose modifications to the initiative that would make it
consistent with the court’s restrictive interpretation of the Guatemalan
Constitution.
The inter-American human rights system continues to provide an important
venue for human rights advocates seeking to press the state to accept responsibility
for abuses. In July 2005, for example, Guatemala held a public ceremony
in the town of Plan de Sánchez, presided by Vice President Eduardo
Stein and attended by the vice president of the Inter-American Commission
on Human Rights, to accept state responsibility for the massacre of 268 villagers
in 1982. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights had ordered this
act of public acceptance in a 2004 judgment.
In a landmark ruling, Spain’s Constitutional Court held in October 2005 that
cases of alleged genocide committed during Guatemala’s internal armed conflict
could be prosecuted in the Spanish courts, even if no Spanish citizens
were involved. Finding that “principle of universal jurisdiction takes precedence
over the existence or not of national interests,” the Constitutional
Court granted the appeal by Guatemalan Nobel laureate, Rigoberta Menchú,
whose efforts to press charges in Spain for abuses committed in Guatemala
had been blocked by a lower court.
