 SWEDEN
 Sweden is an advanced, industrial democracy, whose King is
 Chief of State but has no political power. Executive
 authority is vested in the cabinet, consisting of the
 Prime Minister (Head of Government) and some 20
 Ministers. The unicameral parliament (Riksdag) has 349
 members elected directly every three years, and the five
 political parties presently holding seats are
 proportionally represented. The Social Democratic Party
 under Olof Palme won the latest election in September 1982
 and formed the current Government.
 Sweden has one of the highest standards of living in the
 world, with an extensive welfare system and a mixed
 economy. Worldwide recession has affected Sweden's
 economic performance in recent years, but in no way
 diminished this society's ability and willingness to meet
 all the basic needs of its citizens.
 The fundamental political freedoms and human rights of
 Swedish citizens are guaranteed by the Constitution and
 protected by the Government. Swedes and Swedish officals
 consider the observance of human rights a cornerstone of
 their society, which occupies a prominent position in
 international efforts to enhance human rights. Private
 persons here have recourse to Ombudsmen, appointed by
 Parliament with full autonomy, who investigate complaints
 of possible human rights violations by officials.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 Respect for human life is high in Sweden. The Government,
 political parties, and public regard killing for any
 reason unacceptable. Capital punishment was abolished
 decades ago. A highly effective security apparatus
 reduces the potential for terrorism, although rivalry
 between immigrant groups produced two political murders in
 1982.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of abduction, secret arrests,
 or clandestine detention by Swedish authorities. They had
 no role in the case of a Saudi diplomat's daughter, who
 allegedly was forced by her family to return home and
 marry against her will.
 c. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 . Punishment
 Freedom from these abuses is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. The deportation by authorities of
 24 Chileans roused complaints (domestically and to the
 Council of Europe), as those who resisted expulsion were
 handcuffed and given sedative injections at the airport.
 Investigations by a Swedish Ombudsman and the Council are
 underway.

 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Guarantees with respect to the integrity of the person are
 rigorously enforced. However, habeas corpus aoes not
 exist. Individuals disturbing the public order or thought
 to pose a danger to others or themselves may be held for
 six hours without charge. Criminal suspects may be held
 temporarily under the same procedure, but cannot be
 detained longer than 12 hours without formal charges. If
 a person files for bankruptcy and refuses to cooperate
 with the official investigation, a court can order
 detainment for up to three months (with judicial review
 every two weeks).
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Swedish Constitution forbids deprivation of liberty
 without public trial by a court of law. Every citizen has
 the right to effective counsel. The judiciary functions
 freely and independently of the Executive. There are no
 military courts in Sweden in peacetime.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from arbitrary invasion of the home is guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice. Searches are legally
 limited to cases in which the suspect is believed to have
 committed a crime punishable by at least two years'
 imprisonment. Wiretapping is limited to cases involving
 narcotics or national security. With certain exceptions
 (when time is crucial), searches and wiretaps require
 court approval.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Rights Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Swedes enjoy the full exercise of these freedoms. The
 visual media are censored for excessive violence.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Swedes enjoy the full exercise of these freedoms. A
 permit from the police is required for demonstrations (of
 which there are many) and applications are routinely
 approved, though practical concerns occasionally motivate
 restrictions on time and place.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Swedes enjoy full religious freedoms. A national church
 supported by public funas exists, but in no way inhibits
 the observance of all faiths.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement within and from the country,
 as well as a right of voluntary repatriation. There has
 been a small net migration in recent years. Sweden
 maintains quotas for aam.ipinn of refuo...
 entailing numerous benefits. Political asylum is granted
 without respect to quotas.

 Immigration to Sweden consists of roughly equal numbers of
 Nordic and non-Nordic citizens. There is free immigration
 for the former. Family reunification is responsible for
 the majority of the non-Nordic immigrants. Refugees and
 asylum seekers have come largely from Latin America, but
 also from Eastern Europe, Vietnam, and elsewhere. The
 annual total number has ranged from 3-4,500 in recent
 years; the host country has slightly over 8 million
 inhibitants.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Sweden has a long history of peaceful, democratic
 political life and a vigorous multi-party system. There
 is universal suffrage over age 18. Although voting is not
 compulsory, about 90 percent of the eligible voters
 usually participate in national elections. Aliens who
 have been legal residents for at least three years have
 the right to vote and run for office in municipal and
 national elections. Labor is free to organize, and
 workers .have the right to strike. A large majority of the
 working population belongs to trade unions, including
 career military personnel and civilan government
 officials. Unions and union associations direct their own
 activities. Women enjoy legal equality in Sweden and
 participate fully in the country's political, economic,
 and social life.
 3.   Government Attitude Regarding International ana
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Sweden works actively at the United Nations and the
 Council of Europe to promote international observance of
 human rights. Government agencies are in close contact
 with Amnesty International, the International Committee of
 the Red Cross, church organizations, and a variety of
 other private and public groups working in Sweden and
 abroad for the same purpose.
 Sweden supports the principle of independent outside
 investigations. In September, the European-Court ruled
 against Sweden for the first time concerning the country's
 expropriation procedures which in two cases, according to
 the judgment, denied building owners the full enjoyment of
 their property. Swedish officials expect the Government
 to pay damages and adjust the law. Several private
 complaints against Swedish governmental practice are
 pending before the human rights commission.
 4.   Economic, Social, and.Cultural Situation
 Sweden enjoys an exceptionally affluent standard of
 living, with a per capita GNP of $13,472 in 1981. Life
 expectancy at birth is among the world's highest and the
 infant mortality rate among the lowest. Virtually the
 entire population is literate, with no discrepancy between
 males and females.
 Swedish policies for meeting basic needs for food,
 shelter, health care, and education have been very
 successful. Social welfare and medical services, benefits
 to families, pensions, ano disability and unemployment
 insurance are all provided. The taxation system is
 designed to even the distribution of wealth among all
 
 
 1001
 segments of the population. Unemployment reached post
 World War II highs in 1982 (over three percent of the
 workforce) and emerged as the primary issue of the
 election campaign. It is a problem Swedish governments
 work actively to curb. Institutionalized efforts continue
 to extend equality between the sexes. There is a public
 ombudsman for equal employment opportunity; legal
 protection of the right to equal pay for equal work; and
 public education to break down patterns which associate
 men and women exclusively with specific jobs.
 Government practice 'and popular attitudes encourage a wide
 variety of cultural expression, both from native Swedes
 and immigrants. About 414,000 foreign nationals live in
 Sweden as legal immigrants, of whom about 234,000 are
 employed. They enjoy welfare benefits and legal
 protection as if they were citizens. The Swedish
 Government runs special programs to help immigrants adjust
 to Swedish life and culture (including 240 hours of paid
 language instruction) and encourages the press to assure
 acceptance of immigrants by the Swedish public at large.
 Several anti-immigrant incidents (including intimidation
 and violence) in 1982 prompted swift remedial action by
 authorities, and there has been self-critical
 soul-searching by the press and many Swedes. There are
 effective legal procedures to counter allegations of
 discrimination, which the Government carefully
 investigates.
