TUNISIA
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Tunisian authorities exploited the U.S.-led war on terrorism to curtail public
liberties and keep critics of all viewpoints under pressure.The repression tightened
after April, when Tunisia suffered its first deadly terrorist attack in many years.
Suspected Islamists faced the harshest treatment,with a revival of military court
trials for civilian suspects, long prison terms under inhumane conditions, and
heavy restrictions that kept ex-prisoners from resuming an ordinary life. Liberal
and leftist dissidents encountered arbitrary curbs on their rights to meet, demonstrate,
and travel, and were victimized by assaults, vandalism, and theft credibly
attributed to plainclothes police. A few spent time in prison or remained in exile.
In parliament in April and in a national referendum in May, the ruling Democratic
Constitutional Rally party easily won adoption of constitutional amendments
that included new affirmations of certain rights but, more significantly,
enabled President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali to run again in 2004 and 2009.They also
granted permanent immunity to the head of state for acts connected to official
duties. The amendments were approved by more than 99 percent of the voters—
the same official margin by which Ben Ali had won re-election in 1989, 1994, and
1999.
The Islamist Nahda party remained banned, as did the small but vocal Tunisian
Communist Workers Party (Parti communiste des ouvriers tunisiens,PCOT). One recently formed opposition party, the Congress for the Republic, continued to be
denied legal recognition,while another, the Democratic Forum for Work and Freedom,
was legalized on October 25, eight years after first applying for recognition.
In April,Tunisia suffered the first serious act of political violence in a decade and
the first major terrorist attack to be credibly claimed by al-Qaeda since the September
11, 2001 attack on the United States. The target was North Africa’s oldest
Jewish synagogue, in Djerba, an international tourist destination. Twenty-one persons,
including fourteen Germans, died when a young Tunisian
detonated the gas-laden truck he was driving.The attack was condemned by
all political forces in Tunisia, including the banned Nahda party.
During 2001 and 2002, authorities increasingly referred suspected Islamists to
military courts, particularly those who were arrested after periods spent out of the
country. Tens of civilians were charged, many in absentia, under article 123 of the
code of military justice for “serving, in times of peace, terrorist organizations operating
abroad.”Military courts deprived defendants of fair trial guarantees and their
rulings were subject to no appeal except a narrow review by the Court of Cassation.
On January 30, a Tunis military court convicted Béchir Ben Zayed, Mounir
Ghaïth, Abdelbasset Dali, and thirty absentee co-defendants of forming an al-
Qaeda-linked terror group called Ahl Al-Jamaâ w’al-Sunnah (Adherents of the
Islamic Community and the Traditions of the Prophet). Their lawyers claimed the
court ignored allegations that testimonies had been obtained under duress, arrest
dates had been falsified to hide irregularities, and the prosecution produced no
convincing evidence against the defendants. In April, the Court of Cassation confirmed
the sentences of between eight and ten years for the three men. One of their
absent co-defendants, Jaber Trabelsi, surrendered to authorities in Italy and on June
26 received an eight-year sentence in a military trial closed to the press.
While military trials of civilians were troubling, civilian courts hardly ensured a
fair trial in politically tinged cases. A stark example was the February 2 re-trial of
Hamma Hammami, spokesman of the PCOT, and co-defendants Samir Taâmallah
and Abdeljabbar Maddouri. The three had just emerged from four years in hiding
to challenge their convictions in absentia.
Before the judge could open the proceedings, police surged into the crowded
courtroom and forcibly removed the defendants, prompting a walk-out by the
defense lawyers. The defendants were later escorted into a different courtroom,
where they told the judge that police had beaten them. The judge did not respond
to these allegations.Nor did he conduct any manner of trial or hear testimony.He
swiftly re-imposed the original sentences of nine years and three months on
charges that included “maintaining an unauthorized association,” “defamation of
the judiciary,” and “inciting the public to violate the country’s laws.” Maddouri
received an additional two years for a “defamatory”remark he allegedly uttered that
day.
The sentences were later reduced on appeal. After a five-week hunger strike by
Hammami’s wife, human rights lawyer Radhia Nasraoui, and the confirmation of
the convictions by Tunisia’s highest court on September 2, authorities conditionally
released Hammami and Taâmallah on September 4 for “health reasons.”Maddouri
was conditionally freed on November 5.
Tunisia’s prisons held, at a minimum, several hundred political prisoners. The
great majority had been convicted in previous years for mere Nahda membership
or participation in Nahda activities,without evidence that they had any connection
to acts of violence.During the year, suspected Islamists continued to be arrested or
re-arrested for these offenses, sometimes reformulated as the crime of “associating
with a criminal gang” in order to bypass the statute of limitations that would have
applied to lighter charges.
August marked the tenth anniversary of the conviction in two unfair mass trials
before military courts of 265 suspected Nahda leaders and members for an alleged
plot to overthrow the state. During 2002, some one hundred remained in prison.
These included party leaders like Sadok Chorou, Ajmi El-Ourimi, and Habib
Ellouz, who were serving life sentences under harsh conditions. Like some of the
other leaders, Ali Laaridh, who was serving fifteen years, endured near-permanent
solitary confinement and deprivation of materials for reading and writing.
In January, authorities cited “humanitarian reasons” in conditionally releasing
Mohamed Mouada, a leading opposition politician, seven months after re-imprisoning
him. Initially sentenced in 1996 to eleven years on trumped-up charges of
providing intelligence to a foreign state, Mouada had been conditionally released
later that year but then was subjected to continuous surveillance and harassment
until his second arrest in 2001. On both occasions, Mouada’s imprisonment followed
his sharp public criticisms of the president.
Prisons,which since 2001 have been under the authority of the Justice Ministry,
remained closed to inspections by independent monitoring groups. Inmates staged
frequent hunger strikes to protest overcrowding, poor hygiene,medical neglect, the
assignment of prisoners to facilities far from their families, and other abuses. Strikers
were sometimes beaten, denied family visits, or placed in isolation.
Abdelwahab Boussaa died in March after a four-month hunger strike. Lakhdar
Essdiri died two weeks later,possibly from medical neglect.Boussaa and Essdiri had
been serving sentences of sixteen and twenty-eight years respectively for Nahda
activities. Habib Saïdi, an inmate in his thirties, died mysteriously in late September,
only days before his scheduled release; he was the younger brother of Ali Saïdi,
a civil servant and former human rights activist who was murdered under suspicious
circumstances in December 2001.
Released political prisoners faced surveillance, house searches, passport confiscations,
and onerous measures of control, sometimes court-ordered but often arbitrary.
Freed prisoners were often unable to hold jobs due to government pressures
on employers and orders that they sign-in frequently with police. In September,
Taoufik Chaieb, an ex-prisoner and former high school teacher in Tunis, reported
that police pressures on him and employers had forced him from one job to
another. Chaieb was also deprived of a passport.
After completing an eleven-year sentence for Nahda activities, Abdallah Zouari
defied an order from the Ministry of Interior banishing him to the south of the
country, far from his family home in the capital. For his refusal, a court sentenced
Zouari on August 23 to eight months in prison, a decision upheld on appeal.
Authorities conditionally released Zouari on November 6.
Police also harassed the families of exiled Islamists, questioning them about
their relatives abroad and searching their homes.
The state kept tight reins on all broadcast media and daily newspapers. Only
small-circulation, independent, and party periodicals criticized the absence of
public liberties, and these were confiscated on occasion.
As Internet use continued to expand, authorities imprisoned an online writer
for the first time.Zouheir Yahiaoui had been pseudonymously publishing the satirical
electronic journal Tunezine when authorities arrested him on June 4 at the
cybercafé where he worked. They then searched his house without a warrant and
confiscated computer materials. Yahiaoui was sentenced on June 20 to one year in
prison for disseminating “false” information and sixteen months for theft of
telecommunication services in connection with the unauthorized Tunezine. In July,
an appeals court reduced the total sentence to two years.Yahiaoui is the nephew of
dismissed Judge Mokhtar Yahiaoui (see below),whose open letter to President Ben
Ali first ran in Tunezine.
On June 16, twelve days after Yahiaoui’s arrest, La Presse reported that authorities
had temporarily shut down some Internet cafés that were not complying with
the applicable laws. Tunisia’s Internet regulations were designed partly to prevent
that medium from escaping government controls placed on other means of expression.
While impunity prevailed inside Tunisia, torture victims in exile achieved a victory
when one victim persuaded a French judge to issue an international arrest warrant
in February for a diplomat stationed in Strasbourg, the first such warrant ever
to be issued against a Tunisian. The plaintiff ’s complaint alleged that the diplomat,
Consul Khaled Ben Saïd, had been the supervising police officer in Jendouba in
1996 when agents interrogating her bound her ankles and wrists and beat her with
sticks and fists. Ben Saïd disappeared after the warrant was issued.
In addition to the work of human rights organizations, evidence of civil society
assertiveness included a one-day nationwide strike by lawyers to protest police
intervention during the Hammami trial in February and steps by the General
Union of Tunisian Workers to enhance the union’s internal democracy.
In January, the government hosted a regional seminar on the Land Mine Ban
Treaty in North Africa.The army destroyed one thousand stockpiled antipersonnel
mines as part of the event. On October 4, Tunisia submitted its annual report on
measures taken to implement the treaty.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
As of mid-November, the government had not shut down human rights organizations
or imprisoned human rights defenders in 2002, but authorities continued
to employ a wide range of repressive measures to hamper their activities. Defenders
faced heavy police surveillance, suspicious break-ins and acts of vandalism,
travel bans, dismissals from work, harassment of spouses and children, and frequent
blockage of telephone and e-mail service.
The two leading human rights organizations, the twenty-five-year-old Tunisian
Human Rights League (Ligue Tunisienne des droits de l’Homme, LTDH) and the
three-year-old National Council on Liberties in Tunisia (Conseil pour les libertés
en Tunisie, CNLT), operated in legal limbo: the former because of a 2001 court decision nullifying the election of its outspoken executive committee, the latter
because its application for legal recognition had been rejected.
Police on many occasions prevented, without explanation, meetings called by
rights groups. On May 19, activists heading from Tunis to Jendouba for an LTDH
meeting on political prisoners were intercepted and turned back at a checkpoint on
the intercity road. On June 2, the day that the LTDH celebrated the opening of a new
office in Monastir province, police occupied the premises and changed the locks,
ostensibly pursuant to a lawsuit filed by the landlord. On June 16,Monastir police
blocked a rally organized in solidarity with the local LTDH section, and on July 23,
a court ruled in favor of the landlord and voided the signed lease. On September 10,
police thwarted a meeting at CNLT headquarters in Tunis, pushing away members
and guests as they arrived.
While the state-controlled press maintained a blackout on criticism of authorities
by these organizations and by groups such as the independent Tunisian Association
of Democratic Women, pro-government papers engaged in lurid
campaigns to defame their leaders. For example, Le Quotidien in April lambasted
CNLT spokesperson Sihem Ben Sedrine for supposedly cozying up to Israeli diplomats
while in Geneva, asking whether “organizations that connive with Zionist terrorism
can also be working for the well-being of Tunisians . . . [and] for human
rights.”
Discrediting the LTDH appeared to be the goal of the extensive coverage given
to the charges of attempted rape filed against LTDH Secretary-General Khemaïs
Ksila in September 2001. The pro-government press shed its customary respect for
the privacy of victims of sex crimes, in this case divulging the name of the alleged
victim and covering in a detailed, one-sided fashion the accusations against Ksila.
It even published excerpts of the investigating judge’s inquiry in apparent violation
of Tunisian law. Ksila,who had left the country in 2001, was convicted in February
2002 in absentia for attempted rape and sexual harassment and sentenced to a fine
and ten years in prison.
On December 29, 2001, the Judicial Disciplinary Council dismissed Judge
Mokhtar Yahiaoui from the bench for “insulting the honor of the judiciary” and
violating his “professional duties” and his “obligation of professional reserve.”
Yahiaoui’s offense was to have published, as a sitting judge in July 2001, an open letter
to President Ben Ali denouncing the lack of judicial independence. After persisting
in his public criticism and rejecting inducements to retract,Yahiaoui found
himself the object of anonymous phone threats, surveillance, confiscation of mail,
disruption of phone service, and a ban on leaving the country imposed by the Ministry
of Justice in November 2001. On April 5, after leaving a pro-Palestinian rally
in Tunis, police forced him into a car without explanation and then, twenty kilometers
from Tunis, dropped him off at the side of the road.
The two-year-old travel ban against Moncef Marzouki, a veteran human rights
defender, was lifted in late November 2001, days before the visit to Tunisia of French
President Jacques Chirac. But the ban against Sadri Khiari, a co-founder of the
CNLT and of an unauthorized anti-globalization group, remained in force, preventing
Khiari from defending his doctoral dissertation in France.
Human rights lawyers and defenders in Tunisia suffered a suspiciously high incidence of physical assaults, break-ins, car thefts, and property damage, crimes
that were solved by the police rarely if ever. The office of Bechir Essid, the independent
president of the national Bar Council, was burglarized and ransacked on
the night of October 26-27, 2001. LTDH president Mokhtar Trifi’s law office suffered
a similar fate on the night of February 6-7, 2002.
A high proportion of rights activists endured extended blockages of incoming
and outgoing phone calls as well as disruptions of e-mail service. They remained
unreachable at times when communication with other Tunisians appeared problem-
free.
Lassaad Jouhri, a disabled ex-prisoner, was assaulted by five men in downtown
Tunis in daylight on August 28. They broke one of his crutches and beat him with
it. The men refused to identify themselves as security agents to Jouhri but did so
when ordering a uniformed policeman not to intervene. For Jouhri, it was the most
severe of the assaults he had suffered in apparent retaliation for his publicizing the
plight of prisoners.
The government-sponsored Higher Committee for Human Rights and Fundamental
Liberties received members of the public with human rights complaints
and had authorization to conduct unannounced inspections of prisons.
Foreign human rights organizations and trial observers visited frequently during
2002. However, a delegation from the International Commission of Jurists
(ICJ), arriving to look at the justice system, was turned back at Tunis-Carthage airport
June 16 on the pretext that the government had been “insufficiently informed
of the mission’s objectives.”Another ICJ delegation was expelled upon its arrival on
October 26.
At politically charged trials, police often admitted some foreign observers while
turning away others.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
In its report to the Security Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee, dated
December 26, 2001, Tunisia stated that it “did not wait for the events of 11 September
2001 before taking the necessary measures to combat terrorism, as it had
already proceeded to combat it within its borders and succeeded in countering it.”
Among the measures it listed was the above-mentioned trials in military courts of
civilians who had returned from abroad.
The Committee on the Rights of the Child noted some areas of progress in its
May 28 response to Tunisia’s periodic report, but said it was “extremely concerned
at allegations of violations of the right of the child not to be subjected to torture or
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, . . . particularly in
relation to children of human rights defenders and political opponents.”
As of mid-October, Tunisian authorities had yet to reply favorably to a longstanding
request for a visit by the special rapporteur on the independence of judges
and lawyers.
European Union
The European Union (E.U.) continued to underscore its satisfaction with
Tunisia’s record of economic growth and liberalization, along with the pace of tariff
reductions pursuant to the four-year-old Association Agreement between the
two parties. The E.U. raised rights concerns from time to time, but in a low-key
fashion. At the third bilateral Association Council meeting on January 29, an E.U.
statement praised Tunisia’s success in reducing poverty and illiteracy but regretted
“the absence of progress in certain spheres, notably freedom of expression, assembly,
and association.” Despite a provision in the Association Agreement expressly
addressing human rights, however, the E.U. never suggested that Tunisian rights
violations imperiled the agreement or aid programs.
In its Tunisia Strategy Paper under the Euro-Med Partnership for 2002-2006, the
E.U. declared, “[t]he impetus for a democratic transition, notably with respect to
cooperation with civil society, reinforcing the rule of law and press freedom, seems
highly desirable.” However, it noted, dialogue via the Association Council and
Committee “progressed with difficulty due to Tunisia’s impatience with respect to
criticism by the E.U. concerning matters of human rights.”
The Tunisian government impeded some projects of nongovernmental organizations
that had been funded by the European Commission, on the grounds that it
had been inadequately informed of them,according to a commission official.However,
earlier blockage of European Commission-backed LTDH projects was
reported to have eased during the year.
Responding to a parliamentary question, Commissioner in Charge of External
Relations Chris Patten said on July 26 that the European Commission had earlier
that month “raised in very clear terms the problem of human rights with various
Tunisian ministers and high officials.” In addition to diplomatic communications,
he said, the commission’s financial cooperation program with Tunisia emphasized
human rights, democratization, and the primacy of law.
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on March 14 criticizing trial
and detention conditions for Hamma Hammami and his co-defendants. A small
group of deputies actively defended Tunisian human rights activists and political
prisoners.
France
After it voiced increasing discomfort with repression in Tunisia beginning in
2000, France eased the pressure following the events of September 11, 2001, the reelection
of President Jacques Chirac in May 2002, and the ouster of the Socialist-led
government by center-right parties in June.
In Tunis on December 1, 2001,Chirac praised Ben Ali’s “exemplary” rejection of
“intolerance” and “fundamentalism,” overlooking his use of such labels as a cover
for jailing nonviolent critics and crushing all dissent. “It’s clear that if everyone,
regardless of the country or the religion, had the same attitude, there would probably
be far fewer problems and human rights violations,”Chirac told the press.He
stated that rights issues were raised in bilateral talks, but added, “I have always
strived to do so in a noncontentious manner.”
On February 6, then-Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine of the Socialist Party
spoke more bluntly on the conviction of Hamma Hammami and his co-defendants.
“I am very concerned by the reports I have received concerning the conduct
of the trial,” he said. “Precisely because of the remarkable economic and social
progress it has achieved . . . Tunisia should be widening the space for public liberties.”
Vedrine’s successor, Dominique de Villepin, was more circumspect in his first
months in office.His hosting of Foreign Minister Habib Ben Yahia on July 10 occasioned
no public comment on human rights. However, a French Foreign Ministry
spokesperson cautiously noted on July 30 and August 2 that France had raised with
Tunisia the Hammami case. On September 5, the spokesperson welcomed Hammami’s
release as a “conciliatory gesture.”
Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy conducted an official visit on October 31
described as focusing on security cooperation and the plight of Tunisians in France.
De Villepin visited on November 14 and met both with Foreign Minister Ben Yahia
and President Ben Ali.De Villepin later said he raised human rights in his meetings
but neither he nor Sarkozy commented publicly on the subject.
France remained Tunisia’s leading trade partner. France’s loans and grants surpassed,
on a per capita basis, the aid it provided to any other country, and its diplomatic
mission in Tunisia was among the largest in that country.However, embassy
personnel attended political trials and other human rights events less frequently
than diplomats from Great Britain and the U.S., among other countries.
United States
Washington enjoyed warm relations and conducted joint military exercises with
Tunisia, although it did not view it as a priority country in the region.Washington’s
minimal bilateral assistance included U.S.$3.5 million in Foreign Military Financing
and $1 million in International Military Education Training. According to an
embassy letter dated October 7, “None of the military exercises or financing has
been associated with security forces implicated in human rights abuses.”
The main U.S. contributions to rights promotion were the detailed, hard-hitting
chapter in its Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and the work of U.S.
embassy staff who actively monitored conditions on the ground by meeting with
human rights defenders and attending political trials. But the human rights message
was muddled following the events of September 11, 2001 by often unqualified
praise given to President Ben Ali’s cooperation against terrorism.
Central Intelligence Agency Director George Tenet met with President Ben Ali
in Tunis on February 18 and conferred on anti-terrorism measures. On April 19,
Secretary of State Colin Powell received Foreign Minister Ben Yahia in Washington.
A State Department spokesman that day praised Tunisia as “a strong supporter of
our campaign against terrorism” but gave no indication that human rights issues
were raised in the meeting.
On July 4, U.S. Ambassador Rust M. Deming reportedly declared: “We have
learned a lot from the Tunisian experience in combating terrorism.”The ambassador
described bilateral relations as “exemplary” in an interview published around
the same time in the Revue Méditerranée. In a letter to Human Rights Watch of August 8, Secretary of State Powell stated that the U.S. was continuing to encourage
Tunisia “to address serious concerns about human rights.”He said that Ambassador
Deming had met on August 5 with then-Minister of Human Rights Fethi Houidi
and raised the case of Hamma Hammami, among others. Hammami was released
one month later.
Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Marc Grossman visited Tunis on
November 5 and met with Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi and other ministers.
Embassy sources said he raised human rights issues privately. But in his press
conference that day Grossman avoided mention of human rights concerns while
hailing Tunisia as a “model of social and economic development” and praising its
help in the “global war on terrorism.”
