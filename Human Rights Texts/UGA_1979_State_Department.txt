 UGANDA
 In April, 1979 the Uganda National Liberation Front (UNLF)
 representing more than 20 anti-Amin organizations estab-
 lished a government in Kampala following the city's fall to
 Tanzanian forces. Within the following month, the remnants
 of Amin's forces were defeated, and Uganda entered a transi-
 tional period between Amin's military dictatorship and the
 national elections promised for 1981. The new government
 inherited an extraordinarily difficult situation. The
 treasury is bankrupt, the modern economy and public ser-
 vices are in ruins, and the black market provides the major
 vehicle of commerce because of the disruptions in tradition-
 al commercial patterns and an overvalued currency. *Police
 and public security forces will have to be completely re-
 built, and, in the interim, serious public security problems
 exist. Uganda's problems are further complicated by the
 destruction of traditional norms and values during Amin's
 misrule. During his regime, success did not depend on hard
 work or thrift, but rather on acquiring the right contacts
 and seizing the opportunity for personal aggrandizement
 through corrupt and criminal practices. Those who attempted
 to maintain individual standards of behavior did so only at
 considerable sacrifice and risk.
 The principles of the transitional government include nation-
 al unity, democracy and respect for human rights. Its
 emphasis on human rights is especially significant because
 of the gross and systematic violation of human rights by
 Amin's regime. President Godfrey Binaisa has taken a
 particularly strong stand on violations of human rights
 elsewhere in Africa. Uganda, however, is in a post-war
 period of political and economic instability, and the goal
 of full respect for human rights is still more a promise
 than a reality. Because of serious internal security
 problems, the burden of fear of the Amin years has not been
 substantially lifted for many Ugandans. Criminals have
 obtained many of the weapons left behind by Amin's fleeing
 troops and are a menace, particularly in Kampala. The
 discipline of Tanzanian soldiers, present in Uganda in
 large numbers, has deteriorated, leading to Ugandans' fre-
 quent loss of property and, occasionally, life. Remnants
 of Amin's army are reported to -harass the population in
 remote areas. The professional elite in Kampala has suf-
 fered a number of murders by persons unknown, and several of
 its members have left the country for safety. While Uganda
 has a strong legal tradition, there are uncertainties re-
 garding Uganda's laws on individual rights, including the
 status of the 1967 Constitution.
 1. Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 A few prisoners have been beaten while detained under
 suspicion of committing crimes for political motives.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There are no indications of cruel or unusual punishment.
 
 
 217
 Prison conditions are generally poor, particularly at
 this time of diminished resources.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 There have been cases of arbitrary arrest by the interim
 Government, and not all detentions have been publicly
 announced. However habeas corpus exists under Ugandan law
 and has been generally honored. Many individuals who have
 been detained have been subsequently released.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In non-political cases the right to a fair public trial
 appears to be respected. With respect to political cases,
 the Government is making a substantial effort to provide
 fair trials for senior members of Amin's Government accused
 of a variety of crimes. As noted in section lc above, cases
 of arbitrary arrest and detention have occurred for politi-
 cal reasons.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Homes are entered without warrant in the course of Govern-
 ment efforts to control the serious internal security
 problem and where the Government suspects individuals of
 politically-inspired crimes.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Almost 90 percent of the population historically has been
 involved in agriculture, producing cash and subsistence
 crops largely on privately-owned land. The percentage of
 the population engaged in agriculture increased during the
 eight years of Amin's rule as commerce and industry lan-
 guished. But during this same period agricultural produc-
 tivity dropped substantially with the deterioration of
 markets and the cash economy. A considerable number of
 urban dwellers took up black market and smuggling activi-
 ties. The Government faces a massive job in rehabilitating
 workers' productivity and in providing the capital inputs
 and infrastructure to enable the different sectors of the
 economy to return to productive activity.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 These freedoms are generally respected in practice. The
 press is free;, even the Government's own newspaper is
 able to criticize Government programs and policies. There
 are no limitations on religious freedom. The Government
 has imposed a ban on assembly during the interim period,
 but this is not actively enforced.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Domestic travel is controlled through security checkpoints
 around the country. There is no internal ban on domestic
 
 
 218
 travel, and Ugandans are able to travel freely. No instances
 are known of refusal to allow citizens to travel abroad or
 emigrate.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Uganda's 12 million or more people who did not go into
 exile are governed by a handful of the elite who did.
 President Binaisa has tried to reduce the exiles' dominance
 by filling seven out of 24 cabinet positions with non-
 exiles. The political system is controlled by the National
 Executive Council, which was composed until October of 30
 representatives of anti-Amin organizations in exile.
 Another 60 members who did not go into exile were added
 during that month, and this expanded body will function
 as Uganda's Parliament until national elections are held, at
 the latest in mid-1981. It has not been determined how
 political parties will participate in the elections. The
 Uganda National Liberation Front in theory represents all
 parties, and a ban has been placed on individual party
 activities during the interim period.
 Women had few opportunities for participation in the politi-
 cal process during Amin's military regime.  Under the new
 Government, one cabinet member is a woman. Uganda's trade
 union movement, the Ugandan National Organization of Trade
 Unions, was considerably disrupted during the Amin years and
 will reportedly require extensive reorganization before it
 can again be effective.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 There is no reason to believe that Uganda would resist
 investigation of alleged human rights violations but it
 is not believed that the interim government has received
 any such requests during its brief tenure.
