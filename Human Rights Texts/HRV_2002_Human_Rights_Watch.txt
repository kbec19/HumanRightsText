CROATIA
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
President Stipe Mesic’s government often failed to confront entrenched ethnic
Croat nationalists obstructing reform, particularly on issues of impunity for wartime
abuses and the return of Serb refugees. The Parliament approved constitutional
changes reducing presidential authority and abolishing the upper house of
Parliament in November 2000 and March 2001 respectively. In local elections held
throughout the country on May 20 nationalist parties made significant gains in
some areas. Police intervention was required in some areas, such as Vojnic, where
ethnic Croat nationalist demonstrators tried to keep elected Croatian Serbs from
assuming office.
Croatia’s first census since 1991 took place on March 31, 2001. Some Croatian
Serb organizations protested that the government did not do enough to include
Croatian Serb refugees in the Fedral Republic of Yugoslavia and Bosnia and Herzegovina
in the count. Serbian Democratic Forum (Srpski Demokratski Forum,
SDF), a Croatian NGO, distributed over 50,000 census forms abroad.Comprehensive
statistics were not available at this writing, but preliminary results indicated
that Croatian Serbs made up approximately 5 percent of the population of 4.38
million in 2001, compared to approximately 12 percent in 1991.
Optimism over the extent of Croatia’s cooperation with the International Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) cooled when the ICTY’s chief prosecutor
reported to the U.N. Security Council in November 2000 that the
government’s cooperation was unsatisfactory, particularly in providing access to
documents requested by the tribunal.
Demands by opposition parties to cease cooperation with the ICTY resurfaced
in June, after the ICTY issued indictments against Croatian generals Rahim Ademi
and Ante Gotovina.Opposition rhetoric cooled after the government, standing by
its commitment to cooperate with the ICTY, survived a vote of confidence in July.
General Ademi, indicted for killing at least thirty-eight people and other abuses
committed by troops under his command in the Medak pocket near Gospic in
1993, surrendered voluntarily to the ICTY in July. At the time of writing, General
Gotovina, indicted for killings, house destruction, and other abuses against Croatian
Serbs in 1995 remained at large. The ICTY also publicly charged Yugoslav and
Serb personnel for abuses committed in Croatia in 1991. In October, the ICTY published
a previously sealed indictment against four members of the Yugoslav
People’s Army and Navy for crimes committed during attacks on the Dubrovnik
region. Two of them, Pavle Strugar and Miodrag Jokic, surrendered to the tribunal
in November.Also in October, the ICTY amended its indictment of former Serbian
president Slobodan Milosevic to include charges of war crimes and crimes against
humanity for the killings, torture, imprisonment, deportation, and other crimes
amounting to persecution of the Croat and other non-Serb population of Croatia
in 1991.
Progress was also made on domestic accountability efforts. In February, Croatian
authorities expanded their investigation into the killing of approximately forty
Croatian Serb civilians in the Gospic area in 1991, naming as a suspect former
Croatian Army general Mirko Norac, who reportedly ordered the formation of a
firing squad. Protesters took to the streets to oppose General Norac’s or ICTY
involvement in his trial. The ICTY prosecutor had not indicted General Norac,
however, and she decided not to request that the Croatian court cede jurisdiction
to the international tribunal. In June, Croatian authorities arrested Fikret Abdic,
the leader of the wartime breakaway Bihac pocket of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and
charged him with war crimes. Bosnian authorities had long sought his arrest, but
his Croatian citizenship prevented his extradition under Croatian law. In August,
Croatian authorities in Bjelovar detained four men, accusing them of killing Croatian
Serb civilians and prisoners of war in 1991. In September, six former military
police were arrested on charges of torturing and killing non-Croat detainees in the
Lora military prison in Split in 1991.
Croatian authorities also pursued war-crimes charges against Croatian Serbs.
The OSCE noted a substantial increase in such cases, many of which involved
defendants arrested pursuant to longstanding dormant indictments. Although
some suspects were refugees arrested when attempting to return to Croatia, others
had been present in Croatia for years. In many cases charges were subsequently
dropped, raising suspicions that the arrests were politically founded and arbitrary.
When three men from Glina were arrested in March on the basis of a 1993 warcrimes
indictment, the alleged witnesses,who had been tortured at a detention center,
were unable to identify any of the three as having been present at the scene of
the crimes.At least two of the suspects had been living in Croatia for over a year and
one had regularized his status as a returnee with the authorities. Although these
men were acquitted, fear of such arrests deterred many Croatian Serb men from
returning to Croatia.
Obstacles to the return of Croatian Serb refugees remained a significant human
rights concern.Although by August 2001 over 100,000 Croatian Serbs had returned
according to the U.N.High Commissioner for Refugees, most were elderly.According
to international organizations, significant numbers of these returnees may have
again departed for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or Bosnia-Herzegovina after
only a short stay in Croatia.
Human rights violations contributed to the reluctance of refugees to return and
to their renewed flight. While violent attacks on Croatian Serbs continued to
decrease in frequency, isolated serious incidents contributed to apprehension
about return. Croatian authorities frequently condemned ethnically motivated
attacks and opened investigations, but arrests or judicial proceedings did not
always follow.
A complicated web of discriminatory and confusing legislation meant that few
Croatian Serbs were able to repossess their pre-war homes or obtain government
reconstruction assistance. Although the Croatian authorities acknowledged the
difficulties and modified some legislation, in many cases these changes simply exacerbated
confusion over implementation. For example, the reconstruction law had
excluded housing destroyed by “terrorist acts” from reconstruction (a category the
authorities often used to describe the tens of thousands of Croatian Serb properties
burned and looted following Croatian military operations in 1995). Although this
provision of the law was repealed, some county offices refused to consider such
applications, claiming that the amended reconstruction legislation contradicted
other laws.With few exceptions, courts also failed to rule favorably in repossession
cases where the prewar housing had been socially owned and occupancy rights
revoked because the residents were absent as refugees or internally displaced persons.
There were no mechanisms for compensating people deprived of such property
rights.
Even when their property rights were recognized, Croatian Serbs also faced discriminatory
practices when attempting to physically repossess their property. For
example, in most jurisdictions, officials failed to implement court decisions, particularly
with regard to evictions of ethnic Croats from Croatian Serb property.
Although the authorities acknowledged this common problem, they failed to condemn
even the most flagrant cases, nor did they take action against officials who
refused to implement the law.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Croatia’s vibrant civil society continued to make an active contribution to public
life despite legislation restricting associations. In a serious but isolated incident,
lawyer Srdj Jaksic of Dubrovnik,who was known for taking on human rights cases,
was shot and injured shortly after his Montenegrin client accused of war crimes was
acquitted in December 2000. At the time of writing, there had been no substantial
progress in the investigation.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
The U.N.Commission on Human Rights decided in April 2001 to exclude Croatia
from the mandate of its special representative on the former Yugoslavia. The
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights maintained a field presence
in Croatia,however, focusing primarily on technical assistance to the authorities. In
March, the Human Rights Committee considered Croatia’s initial report on implementation
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.While commending
Croatia on constitutional reforms,the committee criticized the continued
impunity for killings and torture committed during the armed conflict. The U.N.
observer mission in Prevlaka was extended until January 2002. In May,Croatia ratified
the Statute of the International Criminal Court.
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
In June, the OSCE Mission to Croatia reported to the Permanent Council on
Croatia’s progress in meeting its international commitments, highlighting the continuing
obstacles to the sustainable return of Croatian Serb refugees. The mission’s
mandate was extended until December 2001, although staff numbers were reduced
in June.
Council of Europe
The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance published its second
report on Croatia in July. It found that despite the good will of national authorities,
discrimination endured, particularly against Croatian Serbs in war-affected
areas, but also against Roma.
European Union
Croatia further advanced its ties to the European Union, in May initialing a Stabilisation
and Association Agreement, establishing favorable economic and trade
relations and cooperation in justice and internal affairs. The European Union also
continued to provide significant reconstruction and development aid to waraffected
areas.
United States
Continuing its support for moderate and non-nationalist reforms, the United
States funded reconstruction and demining efforts, as well as development and
technical assistance. The U.S. Agency for International Development did not
directly engage in housing reconstruction, but it did fund community infrastructure
and other projects.
