 PAPUA NEW GUINEA
 Papua New Guinea is the largest and most populous independent
 island country in the South Pacific. Owing to rough terrain,
 the population is isolated and culturally disparate (over 700
 languages are spoken), and local interests frequently outweigh
 national concerns. Political institutions are modeled on those
 of Australia, the former governing power, but with significant
 modifications to fit local needs. Thus, the cabinet is
 selected from a popularly elected unicameral parliament; power
 resides mainly in the central Government, but extensive
 responsibilities have devolved to the provincial governments,
 which are also popularly elected. The Constitution enumerates
 all the basic personal freedoms, and in practice the courts,
 mass media, political parties, and trade unions protect these
 rights vigorously. The Government has an excellent human
 rights record -- due process is scrupulously observed and
 political contestants generally respect the rules of fair play.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 Murder for political purposes is unknown in Papua New Guinea.
 b. Disappearance
 Forced disappearance of persons does not occur in Papua New
 Guinea. It is prohibited by law and is contrary to custom.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment is illegal
 and is not practiced. Treatment of prisoners is fair and
 humane. Prison conditions in Papua New Guinea are generally
 good; most are minimum security facilities. There are abuses,
 but prisoners have the right to complain to the Ombudsman
 Commission with the confidentiality of their correspondence
 guaranteed. Public defenders are available. The Papua New
 Guinea Red Cross has access to prisoners.
 e.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There are no political prisoners in Papua New Guinea. Habeas
 corpus exists and is honored in practice. The time period
 between arrest and trial is generally under 90 days. Accused
 persons are allowed visitors. The principle of due process was
 strengthened by a 1979 Supreme Court ruling that voided a
 provision for collective responsibility in a law on tribal
 fights on grounds that it violated the constitutional
 protection against punishment without proof of guilt.
 f.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair hearing and trial is guaranteed by law and
 strictly observed. Trials are open to the public. Defendants
 are entitled to counsel, and counsel has free access to
 defendants. Consultations between counsel and defendant may be
 in private. Defendants are quickly made aware of the charges
 against them, and they and their lawyers can inform themselves
 of the evidence on which charges are based. Papua New Guinea's
 courts are independent of executive or military control.
 
 g.   Invasion of the Home
 
 
 779
 The Constitution insures sanctity of the hone and the Search
 Act requires a court warrant. The provisions are observed.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech and Press
 These rights are protected by law and are exercised. Five
 newspapers produced by three independent companies freely
 criticize government programs and public figures. Both radio
 stations are government-owned, but news reports include
 opposition as well as official views. Australian radio
 stations can easily be picked up on the medium wave broadcast
 band, particularly during evening hours. There is no
 television.
 b.   Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of association is guaranteed and freely exercised.
 Labor unions are protected by law and are active and important
 in the country's economic life. Over fifty trade unions exist
 among which the most significant are the mine workers unions,
 the civil service unions, and the dock workers union. Unions
 are free to strike and do so. Employers organizations also
 flourish. Demonstrations require a permit, but in practice are
 tolerated without it. A government bill to require the owner's
 consent for meetings on private property has met stiff
 opposition from students and unions. The right to strike is
 protected by law. The law provides for binding arbitration of
 labor disputes, but strikes are allowed pending settlement.
 c.   Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed and a wide variety of
 indigenous beliefs and Christian denominations exist. There is
 no governmental harassment or persecution of any religious
 group.
 d.   Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Papua New Guineans are free to travel within the country and
 abroad. Passport fees are not excessive. Naturalization is
 available to foreign residents who satisfy a residence
 requirement and declare their intent within a prescribed time.
 Citizenship can be revoked only if obtained on false
 information or pretenses. Refugees have been admitted from the
 neighboring Indonesian province of Irian Jays. Current
 practice is to return those who come for economic reasons and
 to find refuge through the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
 for those judged likely to suffer reprisal if returned home.
 e.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Papua New Guinea's political processes are free and open.
 Elections are fair, party affiliations are less important than
 traditional affiliations, and ideological distinctions are not
 sharply drawn between parties. Charges of unfair election
 practices are treated seriously by the courts. Political
 parties and independents fielded 1,222 candidates in the June
 1982 election for 109 seats in the National Parliament.
 Regionalism is a factor in politics, but there are no sharp,
 permanent divisions between parts of the country, nor repressed
 minorities. Women can and do vote; some hold high government
 positions.

 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human
 Rights
 There have been no allegations of violations of human rights by
 the Papua New Guinea Government by international or
 non-governmental agencies.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Papua New Guinea shares some, but not all of the problems
 prevalent in the Third World. There is widespread poverty, but
 subsistence agriculture supports 85 percent of the population.
 The strength of traditional culture has helped to prevent
 demographic dislocation and prevent any 'brain drain' -- almost
 every educated Papua New Guinean remains in the country.
 Women play an increasingly active role in the society.
 Although few, there are women doctors and lawyers and women
 have been members of parliament.
 According to available economic indicators, life has improved
 in the last decade in Papua New Guinea. Per capita Gross
 National Product is up from $360 in 1970 to $784 in 1980.
 Infant mortality is down; caloric intake is up. School
 enrollment has increased from 39 percent of primary school-age
 children in school in 1970 to 62 percent in 1980. The
 Government provides education, health, and social services on a
 non-discriminatory basis. However, the systems delivering
 these services are facing serious challenges because of the
 difficulties the depressed world economy has imposed on Papua
 New Guinea. The government depends for much of its tax
 revenues on commodities whose prices are all at low levels.
 The Government has been trying to increase its real
 expenditures by 3 percent annually with most of the new funds
 allocated for basic infrastructure development such as roads,
 schools, ports, and power generation. However, declining tax
 revenues have forced Papua New Guinea to plan for a 20 percent
 budget reduction in 1983 at current prices.
