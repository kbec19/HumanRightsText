 TUNISIA
 An Arab state in North Africa, Tunisia is presided over by
 Habib Bourguiba, President for Life, who celebrated his
 eighty-first birthday in 1984. A parliamentary republic since
 1956, Tunisia has a Constitution which contains guarantees of
 basic human rights. The political system is dominated by the
 ruling Destourian (Constitutional) Socialist Party, founded by
 President Bourguiba in 1934. Three opposition parties have
 received government permission to organize political activity,
 and during 1984 they began to take a larger part in the
 country's political life. Several other opposition groups,
 including the religiously oriented Islamic Tendency Movement
 and three or four left-leaning organizations, still await
 official permission to function legally. The press is subject
 to de facto self-censorship. The Government acts occasionally
 against the press, both foreign and local, by seizing specific
 editions and banning individual publishing organizations for
 fixed periods.
 The key political event of 1984 was the bread riots in
 January, an outgrowth of the economic downturn of the early
 eighties. The Government rescinded its subsidies for bread
 and cereal products with the result that the price of those
 staples doubled. Riots quickly spread from the southern
 cities and eventually touched all major cities. On January 6,
 President Bourguiba restored the subsidies and the rioting
 ceased, but not before the army had been called out to impose
 order. There were substantial losses of property through
 looting, and it is officially estimated that 92 persons died.
 Widespread arrests and trials ensued in whicn judicial
 procedure was not always scrupulously observed. Later in the
 year the Government pardoned many of those arrested during the
 riots.
 The economy recovered somewhat in 1984, with the growth of
 gross domestic product projected at 5.5 percent. The
 principal industries are oil, phosphates, agriculture, and
 tourism. The Government encourages botn private sector and
 state-run enterprise. Tunisia has a genuine trade union
 movement, independent of government control. The Tunisian
 General Trade Union Federation (UGTT) is the largest labor
 body with a membership of about 700,000 workers. A second
 federation, the National Federation of Tunisian Workers, was
 formed in 1984 by dissidents from the UGTT.
 As a result of the Government's commitment to mass education
 for both sexes, the population is increasingly well-educated.
 Women enjoy equal legal status with men under Tunisian law in
 almost all respects. Traditional attitudes restrict, but do
 not bar, participation by women in economic ana political life.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated Killings in
 1984.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances in 19b4.

 TUNISIA
 C. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 punishment
 There is reliable evidence that physical and psychological
 abuse of prisoners occasionally occurs. After the January
 unrest, aouse of rioters at local jails was widespread.
 Although it is thought that some senior officials turn a blind
 eye to such abuses, there are no examples of officially
 ordered or approved torture. There is no known evidence that
 any official was punished for brutality. In its report
 Torture in the Eighties, Amnesty International noted that it
 had received *numerous and consistent allegations of torture
 and ill treatment or punishment of political detainees in
 Tunisia.'
 Conditions in Tunisian detention centers and prisons are poor
 and in some instances injurious to health. Penal conditions
 and the alleged ill-treatment ot prisoners have been tne
 subjects of discussions between the Interior Ministry and the
 Tunisian League of Human Rights, Whose representatives have
 also visited some prisons. In some cases conditions have
 improved as a result.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arrests following the January riots were often the result of
 denunciation or hearsay. Police made midnight arrests at
 several homes without producing warrants or informing
 relatives of the eventual place of detention. On occasion,
 judges accepted unexamined police testimony to arraign persons
 for trial. Prearraignment detention was often lengthy ano
 defendants were held incommunicado, and pretrial detention
 lasted in some cases through July, when the final cases were
 tried. Former Interior Minister Driss Guiga went into
 voluntary exile after the riots rather than face related
 controversial charges of treason before the Tunisian High
 Court. He was found guilty in absentia.
 Under the urging of the Tunisian League of Human Rights, the
 Government is reviewing the practice of preventive detention
 and is reportedly considering placing some statutory limit on
 incommunicado detention. There are presently no time limits.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Following the January riots, the judiciary was instructed by
 the President to take a serious view of rioting and public
 disorder,  subsequently, trials were conducted, with numerous
 irregularities. At a Tunis trial for homicide, the judge
 mocked lawyers, refused to admit evidence on one death, and
 bullied witnesses. At a meeting of their professional
 association, lawyers decided to boycott this judge.
 Defendants in later trials appeared before the judge without
 defense lawyers.
 It is estimated that there are 50 political prisoners in
 Tunisia, down from 102 in 1983' Another 200 or so persons
 were sentenced to varying prison terms for offenses committed
 in connection with the January Dread riots. In August, the
 Government released approximately 30 Islamic fundamentalists
 who had been imprisoned for illegal political activity in
 1981. Most of the former prisoners nave been aole to return
 to their previous occupations, but some still await their
 reinstatement as teachers. Two Islamic fundamentalists who
 
 
 1412
 TUNISIA
 went into exile rather than face the 1981 trial have returned
 to the country without official harassment.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The privacy of the individual and of the home are generally
 respected. However, the security police sometimes secure
 blanket rather than specific judicial authorization for the
 arrest of individuals suspected ot activities posing a
 security threat. Isolateo incidents of the monitoring of
 correspondence and telephones are reported. In practice, the
 security police are not an obtrusive presence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Tunisian citizens feel free to criticize the Government in
 private and, in more restrained terms, in public. The
 Government does not harass those who speak critically in
 public, but personal criticism of President Bourguiba is not
 allowed.
 Tunisian law requires government permission prior to
 publication. During 1984, the Government suspended
 publication or seized issues of at least 10 publications. One
 independent publication failed due to financial losses during
 its suspension. The normal period of suspension is three to
 six months. Seizure depends upon the offending topic and
 varies with individual publications. One issue of Errai, an
 opposition weekly, was seized for printing an article on
 torture in Tunisian prisons and jails. In late October, the
 Government suspended for six months the sale of the
 independent weekly Realites for printing excerpts of an
 interview with an exiled Tunisian politician. In one case, the
 Government later rescinded its suspension of an opposition
 publication. The Government and the Destourian Socialist
 Party also bring pressure to bear on would-be advertisers in
 opposition publications. A wide variety of Western and Arabic
 language publications is available. On at least four
 occasions the Government seized foreign news publications
 which were critical of Tunisia, its government, or its
 politics; and on at least three occasions it seized editions
 of domestic publications.
 Academic freedom is fully respected, and scholarly research is
 not subject to interference.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of assembly, but
 government permission must be obtained to hold political
 meetings. Recognized political parties met freely during the
 year, and in most cases the unrecognized political parties
 were permitted to meet. There were approximately a dozen
 incidents in which unknown persons broke up opposition
 rallies, usually outside Tunis; some regional and local
 opposition political party headquarters were burned. These
 actions are thought to have been carried out by local chapters
 of the ruling party. Ruling party officials say these actions
 are not condoned. No charges have been brought, but the
 Government has expressed concern.

 TUNISIA
 The principal labor organization, the Tunisian General Trade
 Union Federation (UGTT), held meetings witnout interference
 throughout Tunisia in 1984. In September, the Government
 issued a decree prohioiting union meetings at the workplace.
 Although strikes are legal, some strikers were arrested at
 strike sites; however, all strikers were released within 24
 hours. The government practice of requiring certain union
 members to remain at work during strike actions has been the
 subject of a UGTT complaint to the International Labor
 Organization (ILO). The ILO has accepted the UGTT complaint
 and is investigating. On another matter, the ILO in 1984
 urged the Tunisian Government to speed up its efforts to bring
 its legislation pertaining to rehabilitative work and civic
 service into conformity with the Convention on Forced Labor.
 The Government has stated that it plans to make the necessary
 changes anu is cooperating fully with the ILO.
 Professional associations are active. The Tunisian League of
 Human Rights, an independent group with branches in many parts
 of the country, holds regular meetings. Political, labor, and
 professional associations are allowed unnindered association
 with international bodies, although there are restrictions on
 the receipt of foreign funds.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although Islam is the state religion of Tunisia, the
 Constitution guarantees religious freedom. The Tunisian
 Jewish community worships freely and maintains indigenous
 organizations with official protection. Christians, mostly
 non-Tunisians, freely attend church services. Proselytizing
 for religions other than Islam is discouraged. Under an
 agreement between the Vatican and the Tunisian Government,
 several Roman Catholic orders are active. There is no
 religious discrimination in private commerce and employment,
 although government employment is generally reserved for
 Muslims. Loyalty to the ruling party is considereU a
 prerequisite to appointment as administrative personnel in the
 more tnan 2,0U0 mosques throughout the country.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is no requirement for an internal passport in Tunisia
 and free movement within the country is allowed. Passports
 for foreign travel are easily available, but passports may be
 withheld if it is suspected that an individual has clandestine
 links to a foreign government. There is no restriction on
 emigration or repatriation.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 High government office is effectively restricted to members of
 the Destourian Socialist Party. There were no national
 elections during l9b4; municipal elections are scheduled for
 May 1985 and some political parties have begun campaigning.
 Islamic political groups to date have not been allowed to
 function.
 Participation in politics by women is limited oy traditional
 attitudes but not by legal barriers.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Tunisian League of Human Rights has met repeatedly with
 the highest government officials to discuss arrest and
 detention procedures. The League publishes a bulletin which
 details reported human rights abuses. It holds national
 meetings without hindrance. Tunisia also has shown a
 willingness to speak out to criticize human rights abuses in
 other countries. In its 1984 report, Amnesty International
 expressed its concern about the imprisonment of prisoners of
 conscience, procedures in political trials which fell snort of
 internationally agreed standards, and continued allegations of
 torture and ill treatment of political detainees. Freedom
 House rates Tunisia as 'partly free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Tunisia's resources continue to be heavily devoted to
 education and to economic and social development. Tnere have
 been impressive gains in all of these areas. World Bank data
 showed 1982 per capita gross national product (GNP) at
 $1,386. While per capita GNP has continued to increase
 modestly in dinar terms, it has fallen somewhat in dollar
 terms since 1982 due to the dramatic strengthening of the
 dollar. There are regional disparities and pockets of severe
 poverty. School enrollment ratios are high: 103.68 percent
 of the eligible age groups in 1981 were enrolled in primary
 school. Roughly one-third of the country's operating budget
 is devoted to education, and of a population of about 7 million
 in 1984, approximately 1.6 million are in schools. Women have
 equal access to education by law, and approximately 40 percent
 of the primary/secondary school enrollment is female.
 Adult literacy in 1975 was 38 percent. Participation by women
 in the work force is steady at 20 percent. Over 80 percent of
 women who are employed earn income placing them in the lower
 third of the income earning population. Life expectancy is
 about 62 years and infant mortality was 81 per lOU births in
 1984. The population growth rate was 2.4 percent in 1984, and
 the Government has an active program of family planning and
 birth control. The percentage of population witn access to
 safe water in 1982 was 97 percent for urban areas and 25
 percent in rural areas. Calorie supply as a percent of basic
 requirements in 1977 was 112 percent.
 Legal equality between men and women is vigorously supported
 by the Tunisian Government. Equal rights in the areas of
 divorce and child custody are, for example, guaranteed by
 legislation. A small number of women serve throughout the
 Government at all levels; for example, there are 2 women
 cabinet ministers out of 24, there are at least 5 women
 jurists who have direct impact on cases-they hear or review,
 and there are 7 women in the 132-member Chamoer of Deputies.
 Nevertheless, the centralized nature of decisionmaking
 generally limits the influence of women in national
 decisionmaking. Despite tne Government's efforts, traditional
 practices in many cases keep women, especially in the rural
 areas, from full attainment of their legal rights.
