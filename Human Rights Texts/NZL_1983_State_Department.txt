 NEW ZEALAND
 New Zealand has an exemplary record in the human rights field
 and continues efforts to improve and broaden respect for such
 rights. New Zealand has a firm tradition of democracy which
 dates back to its founding in the 19th century. Personal
 freedom, freedom of religion, freedom of the press, universal
 suffrage, rule of law, respect for minority rights, concern for
 the economically deprived, free trade union affiliation, and
 humane treatment of prisoners remain deeply ingrained
 principles in New Zealand society and are fundamental,
 unquestioned tenets of its governance. Its government is a
 multi-party parliamentary democracy in both theory and practice
 and its economy is based on free market enterprise.
 During 1983 there were no major incidents in New Zealand which
 might have influenced its already excellent record in the field
 of human rights. However, there appears to have been greater
 attention given to rights of women and minorities in New
 Zealand, including the Maori and Pacific islanders.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Killing for political motives, whether by the Government or by
 opposition political organizations, does not occur in New
 Zealand.
 b. Disappearance
 Secret arrests, clandestine detentions, and abductions do not
 occur in New Zealand.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment are illegal under New Zealand law and are not
 practiced. Use of excessive force by the police and abuse of
 prisoners are not tolerated and the Government has adequate
 procedures to deal with any allegations of such treatment.
 Capital punishment remains illegal and summary executions are
 nonexistent. Prison and detention facilities enjoy an
 excellent reputation for providing adequate shelter, food, and
 medical care. Prisoners are permitted regular visits by their
 relatives and lawyers, and all prisoners are accorded equal
 treatment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There are no political prisoners in New Zealand. The right of
 habeas corpus is guaranteed. Preventive detention does not
 exist. Those arrested under New Zealand law are charged
 promptly and allowed access to an attorney of their choosing.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 New Zealand law guarantees the right to a fair, public trial
 and this right is faithfully honored. Defendants are charged
 promptly after their arrest, and all charges are stated
 formally and clearly. Defendants are entitled to counsel, with
 (847)

 free, private access guaranteed. The judicial system is
 independent of government interference or influence. There are
 no special courts to deal with political or security offenses.
 Under New Zealand's legal system, defendants are able to call
 witnesses, present evidence, and cross-examine prosecution
 witnesses at trials, and they remain free of double jeopardy.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 The New Zealand Government does not permit arbitrary
 interference with the privacy, family, home, or correspondence
 of its citizens.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 New Zealand has a long tradition of freedom of speech and
 press. The Government makes no attempt to censor or control
 the media apart from legislated exceptions relating to
 pornographic and similar materials and laws against
 defamation. Opposition viewpoints are freely discussed both in
 public and in the media. The New Zealand Parliament in 1983
 passed "freedom of information" legislation which prescribes
 methods by which the press and the public can gain increased
 access to government documents.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The New Zealand population enjoys the right to assemble freely,
 without restriction, and this applies equally to the freedom of
 association. Trade unions, which have a long tradition in New
 Zealand, enjoy these same rights. The Government does not
 interfere in union matters and there are no state-organized
 unions. Public sector employees generally are not prohibited
 from collective bargaining and striking, but there are some
 limited exceptions. These exceptions relate to the safety and
 well-being of the public. New Zealand unions may freely
 associate with international labor organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All religions can be practiced freely in New Zealand without
 government interference. There is no government-favored
 religion, nor is any advantage given to the adherents of any
 particular faith.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is complete freedom of internal and external travel,
 emigration, and repatriation to New Zealand. The right of
 voluntary repatriation is guaranteed. Each citizen enjoys the
 right to change his residence or workplace at will. New
 Zealand continues to be responsive, within the limits of its
 resources, to the resettlement needs of refugees. All asylum
 cases are considered under the same guidelines as those for
 refugees, as defined under the 1951 convention relating to
 refugees.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 New Zealand's Government is genuinely elected by its people, who
 participate freely in all its political processes. New Zealand
 is a multi-party parliamentary state in which two primary
 parties, National and Labour, dominate the political scene and
 alternate in office; the National Party is currently in power.
 The small Social Credit Party now holds two of the 92 seats in
 Parliament. During 1983, a new political party, the New Zealand
 Party, was established. There are other smaller parties and
 groups which are, for the most part, devoted to limited and
 parochial issues, and are usually of little consequence in the
 national electoral process. Suffrage is universal for persons 18
 years of age and older. Voting rates remain high, and
 participation in political groups is common. All opposition
 groups have every opportunity to voice their views, and no groups
 are denied the right to political participation of suffrage.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no requests for such international or
 non-governmental investigations. New Zealand adheres to a number
 of international conventions concerning the protection of human
 rights. Prominent among the numerous organizations which exist
 in New Zealand to protect human rights and oppose various forms
 of discrimination are the New Zealand Human Rights Commission,
 the New Zealand Council for Civil Liberties, the Citizens'
 Association for Racial Equality, the New Zealand Chapter of the
 International Commission of Jurists, the Race Relations
 Conciliator, the National Organization of Women, and the New
 Zealand Branch of Amnesty International. Amnesty International's
 1983 report did not include a section on New Zealand. Freedom
 House's 1983 report calls New Zealand "free".
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Women are legally equal with men and participate freely in all
 phases of New Zealand life. Women now hold eight seats in
 Parliament, and a woman is president of the National Party.
 Discrimination on the basis of sex is illegal, and the New
 Zealand Government takes steps to ensure that this does not occur.
 New Zealand is a developed welfare state and its people enjoy a
 high standard of living. Health, food, shelter, health care, and
 education are available to all New Zealanders regardless of race,
 religion, sex, ethnic background, or political belief. The right
 to own property, individually and jointly, is protected.
 The population of New Zealand (1983) is 3,219,000 with a growth
 rate of .03 percent. Per capita gross national product (1981)
 was $7,651.80". Life expectancy at birth (1980) was 73.33 years.
 The infant mortality rate during 1983 decreased to 12.40 per
 1,000 live births. The adult literacy rate is 99 percent, while
 the adjusted primary school enrollment figures have exceeded 107
 percent for both males and females. As of 1977 the calorie
 supply as a percent of requirements was 124.22. No portion of
 the population is considered to have fallen below the absolute
 poverty level.
