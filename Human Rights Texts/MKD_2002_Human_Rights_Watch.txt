MACEDONIA
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Macedonia’s image as an island of inter-ethnic peace and coexistence in the
Balkans was dramatically upset in February 2001 by the emergence of an ethnic
Albanian insurgent group, the so-called National Liberation Army (Ushtria Çlirimtare
Kombëtare, commonly known as the NLA), and the ensuing months of
fighting between the rebels and government forces. Negotiations between the
major ethnic Macedonian and ethnic Albanian parties, facilitated by the international
community, led to an August 13 peace agreement providing for far-reaching
constitutional and political measures aimed at enhancing the status of the sizeable
ethnic Albanian minority. In return, the NLA agreed to demobilize and hand over
its weapons to a North Atlantic Treaty Organizaation force, deployed in Macedonia
at the end of August. In mid-November, after a long delay, a lot of filibustering, and
mounting international pressure, the Macedonian Parliament finally adopted the
constitutional amendments envisaged by the peace agreement.At the time of writing,
however, fears persisted that nationalists within the government and police
would still try to derail the peace process and pursue a military solution to the conflict.
There was disagreement as to the causes of the conflict,with NLA leaders claiming
that they were fighting to end systematic discrimination against ethnic Albanians
by the Macedonian authorities, while the government claimed that the NLA’s
real goal was control over Macedonian territory. Government officials insisted that
Kosovar Albanian radicalism lay behind the conflict, not legitimate grievances of
Macedonia’s own ethnic Albanians. Support for the insurgency by the country’s
ethnic Albanians, which was tepid early in the conflict, grew quickly as Macedonian
security forces launched increasingly heavy-handed attacks against ethnic
Albanian civilians and their villages and towns. As of mid-October, about 25,000
refugees remained in Kosovo, while 53,000 ethnic Albanians and Macedonians
were still internally displaced within Macedonia.
Both government forces and the NLA committed serious violations of international
humanitarian law in the course of the six-month conflict. The government
police forces, whose brutality against Albanians has long been a cause of intense
resentment, were responsible for a number of grave assaults against civilians and
their property. Following an April government offensive in the Tetovo area, monitors
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) found
evidence of widespread and indiscriminate destruction and looting in the village of
Selce.More than two hundred ethnic Albanians were arrested in the area, dozens of
whom were later treated in the Tetovo hospital for fractures and severe bruising.
Also in April, a joint mission of the Macedonian,Norwegian, and Serbian Helsinki
Committees reported that some thirty men from Poroj had been arbitrarily
arrested and severely beaten by the police, resulting in the hospitalization of six persons.
The Helsinki mission and Human Rights Watch separately blamed government forces for the destruction of the Runica hamlet in the Kumanovo area in retaliation
for earlier NLA strikes. While the Macedonian government accused the
rebels of using villagers in the Tetovo and Kumanovo areas as human shields, it frequently
responded with indiscriminate shelling of those same villages.
Torture and abuse of civilian detainees was routinely used by the security forces
to obtain information on the NLA and to intimidate ethnic Albanians. Following a
May 22 offensive north of Kumanovo, for example, government forces separated
ethnic Albanian men fleeing the fighting and took them to the Skopje and
Kumanovo police stations, where dozens of them suffered torture and severe illtreatment.
Fear of such practices prevented many civilians trapped in the crossfire
from fleeing to safety into government-controlled territory, forcing them instead to
venture through dangerous mountain trails into neighboring Kosovo.
The most serious violations by the government forces were committed during a
three-day operation in a village north of Skopje. Following a land mine explosion
that killed eight government soldiers, the Macedonian police launched a fierce
attack on the nearby village of Ljuboten, which was heavily shelled for two days in
August 10 and 11, 2001. On August 12, several hundred police entered the village
and began a house-to-house assault, killing six ethnic Albanian civilians, burning
scores of houses and terrorizing the village population. Two men were summarily
executed and another three were shot dead after they attempted to flee their burning
home. More than one hundred men and boys from the village were taken to
police stations in Skopje, where they were subjected to severe beatings. As of late
October, about twenty-four of them were still being detained on charges of participation
in the insurgency.Thirty-five-year-old Atullah Qaini died in police custody,
his mutilated corpse bearing clear signs of torture. Three other men were beaten
unconscious by ethnic Macedonian vigilantes in full view of the police. The minister
of the interior, Ljube Boskovski, who was himself present during the operation
in Ljuboten on August 12, claimed that the village was an NLA stronghold and that
the victims were “terrorists.”However, Human Rights Watch researchers who visited
the village, and interviewed victims and eyewitnesses of the abuses, found no
evidence that there was an NLA presence in Ljuboten during the attack or that any
of the villagers put up armed resistance. The police operation appeared to be motivated
by nothing more than revenge.
NLA forces were responsible for indiscriminate killings, abductions, and intimidation
of ethnic Macedonian and other civilians. In June NLA forces arbitrarily
detained and tortured eight elderly ethnic Serb civilians from the village of Matejce,
subjecting them to repeated mock executions. On August 7, 2001, uniformed
members of the NLA kidnapped a group of construction workers on the Skopje-
Tetovo highway, and, holding them for several hours, the NLA fighters severely
beat, humiliated and sexually abused them. The NLA was also suspected of being
behind the August 26 bombing of an ethnic Macedonian-owned restaurant in
Celopek, which left two of the employees dead.About ten persons from NLA-controlled
areas were still missing at the time of this writing, despite claims by rebel
commanders that the NLA had released all captives before its formal disbandment
by the end of August.
Such methods of warfare against civilians were imitated by an array of ethnic
Macedonian paramilitary groups, whose members were largely drawn from the police reserves. Local and international press reported that the most active of those
groups, including the so-called Lions, Tigers, and Red Berets, were controlled by
radicals within the Macedonian police structure. Members of such groups
appeared to have led a June 6 riot in Bitola,where dozens of ethnic Albanian homes
and shops were burned within a few hours. The local police took no action to stop
the attacks; in fact, some police officers took an active part in the rampage. The
paramilitary groups continued to intimidate and harass ethnic Albanians even after
the signing of the peace agreement, threatening to derail the peace process. In a September
15 incident, five “Red Berets” abducted Muharem Ibrahimi, a Tetovo-based
activist with an ethnic Albanian humanitarian organization, and attempted to kill
him by throwing him into the Vardar river.
The conflict also took a toll on the press covering the events. International and
local journalists, both ethnic Macedonian and ethnic Albanian, faced frequent hostility
and occasional violence, mostly from ethnic Macedonian crowds and security
forces. Reporters sans Frontières protested in June against the ill-treatment of the
Agence France-Presse correspondent Colin Neacsu and his interpreter, who were
detained and repeatedly beaten at a Skopje police station.A Macedonian journalist
from the Utrinski Vesnik newspaper was beaten unconscious by a mob outside
Ljuboten on August 10, as were several Swedish journalists trying to enter the village
on August 12. Ethnic Albanian journalists, in particular, faced severe security
constraints and discrimination, and were frequently denied access to the conflict
areas by the police. Albanian language public television broadcasts were interrupted
for three weeks as the Albanian language bureau rejected an order to air only
translations of programs prepared by the ethnic Macedonian editors.
Two serious incidents raised concerns that communist-era practices of surveillance
of the political opposition and civil society continue unabated in Macedonia.
In January 2001, the opposition Social Democratic Union (SDSM) presented evidence
of the unlawful phone tapping of 150 conversations that had taken place
between September and November 2000.Most of those involved, including prominent
opposition leaders and journalists, confirmed the authenticity of the recordings.
A parliamentary investigation led to the resignation of the minister of the
interior,Dosta Dimovska, but stopped short of assigning responsibility for the violations.
The issue resurfaced after the signing of the peace agreement, when a telephone
conversation between Branko Crvenkovski and Arben Xhaferi, the
respective leaders of the SDSM and the Democratic Party of the Albanians, was
leaked to a television station that accused the two of conspiracy against national
interests.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Human rights organizations generally operated freely in 2001, although security
concerns often prevented their members from reaching certain areas of the
country. Both ethnic Macedonian and ethnic Albanian organizations faced difficulties
in moving across the ethnic divide in the conflict areas. The Helsinki Committee
for Human Rights investigated the Ljuboten events and made findings that
were consistent with the conclusions of Human Rights Watch. (See above.) However, investigation and reporting by local nongovernmental organizations on
human rights abuses committed during the conflict was limited overall and at
times one-sided.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
In contrast with earlier conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, the international
community moved relatively quickly in 2001 to bring the inter-ethnic violence in
Macedonia to a halt, and to limit its human costs. The diplomatic efforts of the
European Union, the United States, NATO, and the OSCE, all of which appointed
special envoys to Macedonia, were critical to the negotiation of the cease-fire and
the peace agreement. But while much effort was put into security monitoring and
shuttle diplomacy, the investigation of human rights violations committed by both
sides was inadequate throughout the conflict. At this writing, the international
community stood ready to assist with the implementation of an enduring peace in
the country, but more needed to be done to integrate critical human rights dimensions
into the process.
United Nations
The U.N. Security Council addressed the Macedonian crisis regularly in 2001.
The council supported the timely implementation of the peace agreement and the
deployment of a multinational security presence in Macedonia. The U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) cautioned the Macedonian government at
the end of September that the return of the refugees remaining in Kosovo and of
the internally displaced persons would require ethnically mixed police patrols in
conflict areas.UNHCR-chartered buses facilitated the movement of all communities
across ethnic lines and security checkpoints in the troubled Tetovo region. The
chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia
warned both warring sides early in the conflict that the tribunal’s jurisdiction
extended to the events in Macedonia, and that tribunal staff were on the ground
collecting information on serious violations of international humanitarian law.
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
The OSCE committed itself, under the peace agreement, to providing a significant
number of monitors to report regularly on security incidents, the return of
refugees and trafficking in human beings. OSCE-seconded police experts were
tasked with assisting in the implementation of the envisaged police reforms. On
October 4, however, the OSCE warned the Macedonian government that singlehanded
efforts by the police to hastily retake control of formerly NLA-held areas
were delaying the deployment of the monitors and were jeopardizing the fragile
peace. During the conflict, the OSCE Spillover Monitor Mission to Skopje condemned
human rights abuses committed by the NLA forces, but showed reluctance
to address the serious violations for which the government security forces were
responsible.
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
NATO’s role in the Macedonian conflict was limited by its members’ unwillingness
to maintain a long-term security presence in the country. The 4,500-strong
NATO force deployed in Macedonia throughout September successfully completed
its limited,month-long mission to collect about 4,000 weapons voluntarily handed
over by the NLA. Doubts remained, however, as to whether the NLA had surrendered
all its weaponry. To avoid a security vacuum created by an early departure,
NATO agreed by the end of September to maintain a German-led contingent of
seven hundred to 1,000 troops in the country to protect E.U. and OSCE security
monitors. The second NATO force was to operate in Macedonia for three months,
with the option to extend the mission with the consent of the Macedonian government.
European Union
In April 2001, the European Union and Macedonia signed an Association and
Stabilization Agreement that sets the stage for Macedonia’s progressive integration
into the union within ten years. In October the E.U. pledged to finance a 10.3 million
euro (approximately U.S.$9.3 million) program aimed at supporting the
implementation of the peace agreement. The program was part of a 24.7 million
euro emergency package, and in addition to 42.5 million euros of regular support
to Macedonia pledged for 2001.The package was made, however, conditional upon
the ratification of all constitutional amendments envisaged by the peace agreement.
The European Union maintained that improving the status of the country’s
ethnic minorities was a requirement of the association process, and it postponed a
donors’ conference scheduled for October 15, citing Macedonia’s delay in the
implementation of the agreement.
United States
The United States supported the political and constitutional reforms agreed
upon by the Macedonian and ethnic Albanian parties.The U.S. special envoy James
Pardew, together with the European Union’s Francois Leotard, played an important
facilitating role in the negotiation of the peace agreement. Although the United
States contributed no troops to the two NATO missions, it provided intelligence
and logistical support. The U.S. administration pledged also to support the Macedonian
police reform, training of ethnic Albanian police officers, the return of
refugees and the new Southeast Europe University, set up to provide higher education
in the Albanian language.
