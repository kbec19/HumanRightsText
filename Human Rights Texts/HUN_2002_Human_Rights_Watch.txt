HUNGARY
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
While the majority of Hungarian citizens enjoyed a full measure of civil and
political rights and the benefits of a modernizing economy, those on society’s margins
continued to face discrimination and abuse. The poor treatment of the
country’s Roma remained the key concern, despite E.U.-funded government
efforts to improve their status,while anti-Semitism and hostility towards gays persisted.
Prison overcrowding and police misconduct continued to draw international
criticism.Despite some improvements, the state response to violence against
women remained inadequate. Asylum seekers faced long periods of detention
before their claims were heard, and few were granted refugee status.
The situation for many Hungarian Roma remained precarious.With average life
expectancy ten years shorter than the rest of the population and an unemployment rate ten times higher than the national average, Roma faced discrimination in
employment, housing, education, and the criminal justice system, as well as physical
attacks. The French government’s decision in March to grant asylum to fifteen
Hungarian Roma underscored the gravity of their difficulties.The fifteen were part
of a group who fled from the Hungarian village of Zamoly to Strasbourg during
2000 to escape threats, physical attacks and the destruction of their homes. Applications
from ten other Zamoly Roma were rejected by French authorities, while
others remained pending at time of this writing.
Police misconduct against Roma continued. On February 9, police officers
raided a Roma settlement in the village of Bag. Four Roma were beaten, including
an eight-year-old boy. An April 24 police raid on a Roma family party in Budapest
left one family member hospitalized and four more injured. The police response to
reports of violence against Roma was also a concern. The European Roma Rights
Center reported that five Roma men were shot at and threatened in the village of
Fiserbocsa on May 5, allegedly in the presence of a police officer.After several failed
attempts to register a complaint about the attack with police in nearby Kiskoros,
one of the men, Pal Sztoja, returned to the police station on May 10 with a hidden
camera to report the incident. The officer refused to take down the complaint,
threatened to beat Sztojka and said it was unfortunate he had not been killed in the
shooting.
On June 17, gasoline bombs were thrown at the home of Jozsef Ajtai, the head of
the Roma Minority Self-Government in Hencida village. Two of Ajtai’s daughters
suffered burns from the attack. Gasoline bombs were also thrown at two houses in
the village of Jaszladany on June 5, one belonging to a Roma family. No one was
injured.
Discrimination against Roma remained pervasive. On January 30, a Roma man
was prevented from checking onto a flight to Canada by Hungarian airline staff
who claimed he lacked proof of sufficient funds for his stay.His ethnic Hungarian
wife and child were permitted to check in. The denial appeared linked to the large
numbers of Hungarian Roma seeking asylum in Canada. On February 21, a primary
school biology teacher in the village of Erdotelek told pupils that “Gypsies”
were characterized by a “special odor” and were generally either unemployed or in
prison. The leader of the Roma Minority Self-Government in Erdotelek reportedly
received death threats after complaints to the mayor about the teacher.
Some positive steps were taken to improve the status of Roma during 2001,
notably the March 8 decision by the state radio and television board to grant a permanent
license to the Budapest-based Radio C, Hungary’s first Roma-run radio
station. In May, the government launched an E.U.-backed program aimed at
improving infrastructure in Romany settlements and combating discrimination.
Discrimination was also evident in continuing anti-Semitic programming on
state radio and anti-Jewish comments by the vice-president of the parliamentary
Hungarian Truth and Life Party. In July, a district mayor in Budapest sought to ban
gay and lesbian groups from participating in an popular music festival. Although
the government signed the antidiscrimination protocol of the European Convention
on Human Rights in November 2000, it again failed to introduce a comprehensive
domestic antidiscrimination law, even after Parliament adopted legislation granting freedom of movement and access to social welfare programs to the estimated
five million ethnic Hungarians living in neighboring countries.
Prison conditions remained a concern. A comprehensive report on Hungary
released by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) on
March 29 identified overcrowding and limited access to work and exercise facilities
as key difficulties, echoing the findings of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee’s
prison monitoring program. The CPT also flagged shortcomings in the treatment
of pre-trial police detention, including reports of beatings by police and delays in
access to legal counsel.
Hungary remained a popular transit country for asylum seekers and migrants,
and a country of origin, transit, and destination for trafficking. Despite some
improvements in the asylum system, many asylum seekers endured lengthy detention
periods while their claims were adjudicated. Few of those accepted as having
valid claims were granted refugee status, with most given “authorization to stay,”
granting little assistance other than protection from refoulement for one year,
renewable after review. In late September, authorities transferred all Afghan asylum
seekers and refugees to guarded facilities in Debrecen and Szombatheley, citing
concern for the refugees’ safety. Human rights groups believed the measure was
motivated by fear of terrorism after the September 11 attacks on the U.S. and violated
Hungarian law.
Following the suspicious death of a thirty-year-old refugee from Cameroon
during his deportation by police on December 18, 2000, the Hungarian Helsinki
Committee called for an investigation into the cause of death, which an official
autopsy identified as a heart attack.Authorities failed to investigate the complaint.
The state response to human trafficking remained poor, with uneven enforcement
of antitrafficking legislation, inadequate victim support services, and frequent
police hostility toward women victims. Victims of domestic violence and
sexual assault in Hungary faced a biased legal system and a lack of support services.
The appointment of prominent member of the ruling Fidesz party,Karoly Mendreczky,
as president of Hungarian Television (Magyar Televizio), on July 12, raised
questions about the state broadcaster’s editorial independence, despite Mendreczky’s
resignation from the party prior to taking up his new post.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
There were no reports of government interference in the work of human organizations,
although Roma community leaders who stood up for minority rights
sometimes faced harassment and violence.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
Hungarian Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi addressed the U.N. Commission on Human Rights on March 30, emphasizing Hungary’s support for a binding convention
on the rights of minorities.On November 6, the Hungarian Parliament ratified
the statute of the International Criminal Court.
Council of Europe
The Committee for the Prevention of Torture report and Hungary’s response to
it were both published on March 29. On September 17, the Advisory Committee on
National Minorities published its opinion on Hungary, noting much progress but
also deep concern about the plight of Roma. Hungary signed Protocol 12 of the
European Convention on November 4, 2000.
European Union
Hungary continued to be regarded as a front-runner for early accession to the
European Union. During a visit to Hungary on April 5, European Commission
President Romano Prodi highlighted the treatment of Roma as an area for further
progress. Discrimination against Roma was also flagged in a May report by Luis
Queiro, the European Parliament’s rapporteur on Hungary, and reflected in the resolution
on Hungary adopted by the full Parliament on September 5. The November
2001 regular report from the European Commission on Hungary’s progress
toward E.U. accession identified a need for greater government commitment to
improve the lot of Roma.
United States
Secretary of State Colin Powell made no public reference to human rights in
Hungary during a meeting with Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi in Washington
DC on May 1 or during his visit to Budapest on May 28-30 for a meeting of North
Atlantic Treaty Organization foreign ministers. Outgoing Secretary of State Madeline
Albright did raise discrimination against Roma with Minister Martonyi in
Budapest in December 2000. The State Department country report on human
rights practices in Hungary for 2000 reflected difficulties faced by Roma and concerns
over police misconduct, and its July trafficking report criticized Hungary for
failing to meet minimum standards.
