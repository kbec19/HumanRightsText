 SULTANATE OF OMAN
 Oman is an absolute monarchy, with no elected bodies or trade
 unions; freedom of speech and assembly are circumscribed. In
 1981, however, the Sultan formed a consultative council which
 -- even though its members are appointed by the government --
 is broadly representative of the population. Its scope at
 present is limited to economic and social development issues.
 Almost toally undeveloped when Sultan Qaboos came to the throne
 in 1970, Oman has used its modest oil revenues effectively to
 foster national social, economic and political development. In
 the southern province of Dhofar a major insurrection supported
 by the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) with some
 Soviet and Chinese backing was defeated in 1976, but continued
 hostility from the PDRY forced Oman to devote much of its
 revenues to defense. Nonethelessi the government has achieved
 significant improvement in the living standards of its people.
 Political development is still embryonic.
 Although the human rights situation in Oman includes problems,
 there have been improvements in recent years. Formal
 codification of civil and political rights is lacking, but in
 practice the government is reasonably accessible to the people.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There have been no known political or military killings of
 civilians in Oman in recent years.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no allegations of disappearances in 1982.
 c. Torture
 The Omani criminal code prohibits torture, and this prohibition
 appears to be observed in practice.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Corporal punishment is not practiced; the physical penalties
 prescribed by Islamic Law are commuted by the government to
 prison terms. The few executions in recent years have been of
 convicted murderers. While some local detention facilities are
 inadequate, the major prison is modern and relatively healthful.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Omani law does not specifically include habeas corpus or its
 equivalent, but the criminal code imposes penalties for
 unjustified arrest and detention by the authorities. In
 practice, the period of detention before trial is usually very
 short. Citizens have several channels through which to
 petition for redress of grievances, and these appear to
 function well. Abuses of the porice power of arrest have
 occurred. There are also reports of petty arbitrariness,
 usually by law enforcement officials in outlying districts who
 exceed their legal mandate. The Government of Oman has
 publicly neither acknowledged nor denied the holding of
 political prisoners. However, there are no reports of Omanis
 
 
 1238
 in prison merely for organizational affiliation (though
 membership in unauthorized organizations is a criminal
 offense). A few insurgents from the Dhofar insurgency
 (1965-76) are reportedly still under detention.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Islamic law prescribes a fair and speedy trial before
 experienced and impartial judges, and judicial practice in Oman
 appears to conform to this prescription. There is no right to
 a jury, to counsel, or to a public trial. However, observers
 who bear some relationship to the defendant have generally been
 permitted to attend trials. The defendant is formally charged
 at an initial hearing, before a magistrate of the police court
 in the capital area or a local governor in outlying areas. The
 case is either resolved at that level, or referred to a higher
 or specialized court. The defendant may call and question
 witnesses, but may not appeal the venue of the trial. If
 convicted, he may appeal his case to the chief magistrate of
 the police court system or to the appellate court of the
 Islamic court system, and ultimately to the Sultan in the case
 of serious offenses. The various judicial systems are
 subordinate to the Sultan, but in practice they operate fairly
 independently. There are no political or security courts, and
 military courts try only military personnel.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Warrants are not required for police searches of private
 premises. Such searches, and probably instances of electronic
 surveillance as well, appear to be infrequent and to involve
 cases where the government perceives a security threat or when
 smuggling (especially of arms and narcotics) is suspected.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Criticism of the Sultan is prohibited by law, and there are no
 legal guarantees of free speech or freedom of the press.
 Criticism of individual officials and agencies is tolerated,
 but is not accorded media exposure. Although the government
 does not practice prior censorship, editorials by the media,
 both private and government-owned, almost invariably reflect
 official views. The government holds a monopoly on radio and
 television broadcasting, and publishes the only two daily
 newspapers. Subsidies to the several privately-owned weekly
 and bi-weekly publications provide effective incentive to
 self-censorship, and arrests or closures for offensive articles
 have occurred. Publications from abroad are censored for
 politically or sexually offensive material and are occasionally
 banned; generally, only articles that directly attack or
 embarrass the Omani government are excised. Academic freedom
 is not an issue as there are no institutions of higher
 education.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is not guaranteed. All associations must
 register with the government, and those which oppose the
 political system of the Sultanate are prohibited. Labor unions
 and strikes are illegal, and there are no professional groups
 of note.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Oman is officially an Islamic state, and virtually all Omanis
 are Muslims. The majority Ibadhi Muslims do not discriminate
 
 
 1239
 against other Muslims. Non-Muslims are allowed to practice
 their religion freely and to build houses of worship. They are
 not subject to discrimination, but may not proselytize. On the
 other hand, conversion to Islam is encouraged, publicized, and
 rewarded.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Omanis living abroad before 1970 have returned to Oman in large
 numbers without legal obstacles, and with official
 encouragement. Included in this group are several thousand
 ethnic Omani refugees from East Africa who have been
 successfully resettled. Omanis may travel and emigrate freely
 to foreign countries. Many Omanis now work abroad, especially
 in the United Arab Emirates, returning home on weekends.
 Expatriate workers, mostly from South Asia, comprise over half
 the non-traditional labor force. They are monitored closely
 and, with a few exceptions, are not allowed to settle
 permanently in Oman. The police conduct periodic sweeps to
 detain and deport undocumented aliens. Non-Omani refugees are
 not permitted to remain in the country and are returned to
 their homelands unless they can be resettled in third
 countries. With the exception of Dhofar Province and small
 portions of the northern mountains, where special travel
 permits are required for security reasons, there are no
 restrictions on travel by Omanis within the country. The
 government has undertaken an extensive program of road building
 throughout the Sultanate. Women are subjected to no special
 travel restrictions and are free to own and operate motor
 vehicles. They may engage in business and hold government
 employment although the numbers doing so are still very few.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Oman is an absolute monarchy. Political parties, non-violent
 opposition groups, elections and constitutions are unknown.
 However, citizens have access to senior officials both directly
 through petition -- a traditional practice -- and through
 several official channels.
 The Al Bu Said dynasty has ruled Oman since 1749, although its
 control over the interior of the country was not consolidated
 until an Ibadhi tribal rebellion in central Oman (1954-59) and
 the Dhofar rebellion (1963-75) were put down with British and
 other outside assistance. Because of economic development (for
 which- the Sultan is largely given credit by the people) and the
 coopting of traditional tribal and religious leaders, Ibadhi
 opposition to the Sultan is now quiescent. The only active
 opposition to the government today comes from the remnants of
 the Marxist Peoples Front for the Liberation of Oman (PPLO) in
 Dhofar and its exiled leaders in South Yemen.
 In an effort to broaden participation in the government, the
 Sultan formed the Consultative Council for the State in 1981.
 It consists of 45 appointed members, drawn from the government,
 the business community, and the outlying regions. It includes
 members of every significant ethnic, geographic, and religious
 sector of the population. The Council's role at present is
 limited to advising the government on economic and social
 policies, but there are indications it may be tasked with
 additional responsibilities in the future.
 Outside Muscat, government still reflects the tribal nature of
 Omani society. The 37 provinces are administered by Iwalis"
 
 
 1240
 (governors), nearly one-third of whom are members of the royal
 family. Traditional elites -- tribal shaykhs and elders, and
 members of the area's prominent families -- dominate the tribal
 and town councils, which settle intratribal disputes and advise
 municipal officials on local matters. On the provincial and
 national levels the Council of Qadhis -- religious judges of
 the Ibadhi sect of Islam -- advises the Sultan on Islamic
 affairs and passes on the conformity of individual decrees with
 Islamic law.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The government declined to receive a proposed Amnesty
 International mission in 1972, when the Dhofar insurgency was
 at its peak. Since then, there have been no known requests by
 international human rights organizations to visit Oman. There
 are no independent organizations based within the country that
 observe, report, or contest human rights violations.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Before 1970, the government actively discouraged all forms of
 modernization. Oman was one of the poorest countries in the
 world, with a rudimentary economy and virtually no
 infrastructure. The commencement of oil exports in 1967, the
 accession of Sultan Qaboos in 1970, and the oil price increases
 of 1974 and 1979 have enabled the country to make great
 advances in almost every index of development. The government
 has made a commitment to improving the quality of life for its
 citizens and has devoted a large proportion of its oil revenues
 to infrastructure building, industrialization, and improvements
 in the traditional pursuits of agriculture and fishing.
 Between 1970 and 1980 the number of hospital beds was increased
 from 12 to several thousand,.the number of students from a few
 hundred to nearly 100,000, and the length of paved roads from
 approximately ten kilometers to over 2,000. Life expectancy
 has increased by some five years to 48i and programs to
 eradicate endemic diseases are well underway. The infant
 mortality rate is 128/1000. Boosted by the return of Omanis
 from overseas, immigrants attracted by job opportunities and
 improved health care, population growth has increased to
 3.1 percent a year.
 Nonetheless, a great deal remains to be done, and in much of
 the country development has barely begun. Many towns and most
 rural areas still lack reliable supplies of safe water or
 electricity. The adult literacy rate is still well below
 50 percent, and only 57 percent of children are in primary
 school. For cultural reasons the education of girls
 (37 percent in primary school) lags far behind that of boys
 (76 percent in primary school). While many social groups in
 the capital area are becoming increasingly Westernized and
 cosmopolitan, outside this small area society is still highly
 traditional, tightly organized along family and tribal lines.
 Similarly, although-per capita gross national product is now
 over US $4,000 a year, the benefits of the new prosperity have
 accrued largely to a limited number of individuals and social
 groups in the capital area, despite some government effort to
 reverse this trend. There is little or no discrimination on
 the basis of race or ethnic origins, and the government
 actively promotes greater freedom for women.
