 PAPUA NEW GUINEA
 Papua New Guinea is the largest in area and popu-
 lation of the independent states in the South Pacific.
 It is also the most diverse - over 700 languages are
 spoken - and tribal affiliations are often stronger than
 allegiance to the national government. Papua New Guinea
 is a parliamentary democracy with a unicameral house.
 Significant powers are delegated under the constitution
 by the central government to provincial governments which
 are popularly elected. The diverse nature of the tribal
 population and the rapid change in transition from stone
 age to modern lifestyles have presented many challenges
 to national unity and has made difficult the extension
 of government to all sectors of the country. Despite
 these pressures Papua New Guinea has created strong
 democratic institutions and has a deep concern for human
 rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law and custom in Papua
 New Guinea.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punish-
 ment
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
 is illegal, and not practiced or condoned. There are
 no summary executions in Papua New Guinea. Treatment of
 prisoners is fair and humane. Public defenders are
 available. The Papua New Guinea Red Cross has access
 to detainees.
 C. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There are no political prisoners in Papua New Guinea.
 Habeas Corpus exists and is honored in practice. Pre-
 ventive detention does not exist. Persons are not held
 clandestinely, and do not "disappear."
 In mid-1979 the government gave emergency security
 measures to the national police in five highlands pro-
 vinces to suppress tribal warfare that had escalated
 to alarming dimensions. The special police powere were
 rescinded within three months following a lessening of
 violence and tension.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair hearing and a fair trial is
 guaranteed by law. Defendants are entitled to counsel,
 and counsels have free access to defendants. Consulta-
 tions between counsel and defendant may be held in
 private. There is no harrassment of defense counsels
 by the government.
 Defendants are made fully aware of the charges brought
 
 (502)

 against them, and they and their lawyers can inform them-
 selves of the evidence on which charges are based.
 Papua New Guinea's courts are independent of execu-
 tive or military control. In 1979 the courts did not
 hesitate to prosecute senior government officials,
 including several Cabinet Ministers who were found guilty
 and given prison sentences. There are no special courts
 to deal with security or political offenses. Civilians
 are not tried by military courts. There have been
 no executions of any kind. An Ombudsman's office has
 been established and investigates complaints against the
 government.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 There is respect for the sanctity of the home and
 warrants are required as a matter of law. Illegal entries
 of the home are not condoned.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs As Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 As a developing, newly independent nation, Papua New
 Guinea lacks much of the social welfare infrastructure
 required to meet the basic needs for food, shelter, health
 care and education. Subsistence agriculture is practiced
 in most rural areas, so that starvation is not a problem.
 The government is approaching the provision of basic needs
 in a methodical manner and is making progress. Papua
 New Guinea has set for itself national priorities and
 is directing government revenues and foreign assistance
 to these clearly defined goals. There is a strong em-
 phasis on rural development and on reducing urban migra-
 tion. There is a strong commitment to capitalist enter-
 prises, and to the attraction of foreign investment.
 Private property is owned and rights to it are
 protected. The government seeks to provide adequate
 shelter, health care and education to the extent that
 its limited resources can bear. Corruption is not a
 factor in regard to human needs in Papua New Guinea.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedopm of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These rights are protected by law. There is a free
 press. Although there is only one radio station and it
 is government owned, it nevertheless appears unfettered
 in news reporting and often carries news items unfavorable
 to the government. Additionally, Australian radio stations
 can easily be picked up on the medium-wave broadcast
 band, particularly during evening hours. There is no
 television in PNG. The labor movement is free and active
 and there are no restrictions on the right to strike,
 even by public service employees.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Fcareign
 Travel and Emigration
 
 57-265 0 - 80 - 33
 
 
 504
 Papua New Guineans are free to travel within the
 country and abroad. Passport fees are not excessive.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Papua New Guinea's political processes are free and
 open. Elections are fair, party affiliations are less
 important than tribal affiliations, and ideological
 positions are not sharply drawn between parties.
 Women play an active role in social, economic and
 political arenas. There is no discrimination by sex.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Viola-
 tions of Human Rights
 We are unaware of any such allegations against the
 Papua New Guinea Government or of any requests for in-
 vestigation.
