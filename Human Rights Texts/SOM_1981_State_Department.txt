 SOMALIA
 Real authority in Somalia, which has one legal political
 party, is in the hands of President Siad and a few close
 associates. The constitution adopted in 1979 confirmed the
 existing institutions of government and provided for some
 guarantees of individual rights. Despite this, most human
 rights are restricted by the government. The first major
 development under the new constitution was the establishment,
 in December 1979, of the people's assembly, but its func-
 tions are tightly circumscribed. Somali leaders have stated
 that the aim of socialism in Somalia is to mobilize the
 population to overcome poverty and ignorance. They have
 subordinated individual liberties to these economic and
 social goals. The Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party
 (SRSP) is the only legal political party.
 The government has sought to overcome clan divisions and has
 greatly improved the status of women despite opposition from
 traditional elements of Somali society. Women now legally
 enjoy the same economic and political rights as do men and
 hold several prominent government positions. The govern-
 ment's security apparatus remains pervasive, and, within
 Mogadishu, roadblocks and searches have increased as a
 result of sporadic bombings for which the Somali Salvation
 Front (SSF) claims credit. The government has shown concern
 for the well-being of hundreds of thousands of refugees who
 have fled the Ogaden because of warfare between Ethiopia and
 Somalia. A significant amount of its slender resources has
 been devoted to the care of refugees.
 The government declared a state of emergency in October
 1980, citing as primary reasons domestic economic ineffi-
 ciency and corruption, as well as external threats. All
 provisions of the constitution which conflicted with the
 state of emergency were suspended. The president continues
 to rule through decrees approved by a reconstituted supreme
 revolutionary council appointed under the president's
 emergency powers. The declaration of emergency was not
 accompanied by repressive measures and has had little impact
 on the status of human rights as described in the following
 paragraphs.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 No credible reports that torture was practiced in Somalia in
 1981 were received. Exiled dissidents, however, continue to
 claim that torture is used to obtain confessions in security
 cases. The constitution provides that prisoners shall not
 be subjected to physical or mental torture.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Conditions in prisons and detention camps are spartan. Diet
 is poor and adequate medical treatment is difficult to obtain
 
 (226)
 
 
 227
 in these facilities but there is no evidence of intentionally
 degrading treatment of prisoners, nor is there evidence that
 treatment varies by social class, race, sex or religion.
 However, according to reports, some political prisoners are
 held in solitary confinement in small, permanently-lit,
 basement cells and are denied access to family and legal
 counsel.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no reported cases of disappearances in 1981.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution provides that every person deprived of
 political liberty "shaUl forthwith be informed of the
 offense of which he is.accused* and that anyone detained
 on security grounds-shell "without-delay" be brought before
 a competent judicial authority within the limit prescribed
 by law. Despite this provision, arbitrary arrests and
 imprisonment continue, including the imprisonment of five
 "leftists" during 1981. Some officials of the previous
 government, which was overthrown in 1969, remain in deten-
 tion. Their number has been estimated at perhaps two
 dozen, and includes a former prime minister and a former
 commandant of the national police force. Many others who
 had once been detained have since been released.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Political dissenters are not always accorded a public
 trial. For example, the former prime minister and police
 commandant referred to above have never been tried. The
 national security court operates outside the regular legal
 system and has jurisdiction over a broad range of crimes,
 including attacks against the state, public administration,
 members of the government, the military force or public
 order. Under the Somali system of government no institu-
 tion, including the court, is independent. The National
 Security Court in particular appears to be a political
 instrument of the government. Defendants before this court,
 as well as the regular courts, are supposed to be given the
 right of legal counsell often they are not.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Homes of political dissidents and those suspected of
 political dissent are subject to arbitrary searches. In
 these cases, Somali law protecting sanctity of the home is
 superseded by search and seizure authority of the national
 security service.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The press is entirely government-controlled. The media
 do not air opposition views or fundamental criticism of the
 government. Foreign publications are subject to censor-
 ship before they can be sold or otherwise offered to the
 public.
 
 
 228
 The constitution provides for freedom of assembly, speech,
 and press, but adds that the exercise of these freedoms
 should not contravene the "laws of the land, general morality
 and public order." Freedom of assembly is severely circum-
 scribed. Most meetings and all rallies are organized by the
 government. The labor movement is part of the unitary
 political system and is subordinate to the control of the
 party. Thus the unions have no right or authority to take
 any independent action. Strikes are not permitted.
 The constitution provides that the state religion is *Islam,"
 which is the religion of the overwhelming majority of the
 Somali population. Adherents of other religions are allowed
 to worship freely, but may not proselytize for new members.
 Muslims in Somalia are allowed to practice their faith freely
 as long as their religious leaders do not challenge the
 political orientation and legitimacy of the government.
 Members of minority religions do not suffer persecution or
 harassment.   However, non-Muslims do not rise to the top
 levels of the government.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Repatriation and Emigration
 Although there are no legal restrictions on movement within
 the country for Somali citizens, the military and police
 monitor movement along main roads, particularly near larger
 urban areas and military emplacements and sensitive border
 areas. Complete government control or monitoring is impos-
 sible in a country where an estimated 70 percent of the
 population lead nomadic or semi-nomadic lives. External
 threats directed against Somalia have resulted in increased
 restrictions on movements within Mogadishu, however. The
 Ethiopian and Libyan supported Somali dissident group called
 the Somali Salvation Front (SSF) has claimed responsibility
 for a number of explosions in Mogadishu which were designed
 to intimidate local residents. These bombings have not
 caused any serious damage or injury, but occasionally
 freedom of movement within the city has been hampered due to
 increased security precautions.
 Air travel on domestic flights is controlled and monitored
 for both Somali citizens and foreigners. Issuance of
 passports was almost completely halted early in 1980. The
 government now issues laissez-passers valid for travel to
 specific countries if the prospective travelers can make
 convincing cases for travel. This change was apparently
 designed to prevent emigration of trained Somalis to the
 Arab world. However, the government recently decided to
 liberalize passport issuance and plans to open offices In
 Mogadishu and several other cities to implement this plan.
 Movement by land across the Kenyan, Ethiopian and
 Djiboutian frontiers cannot be effectively controlled and
 nomadic groups cross these frontiers frequently.
 Most Somalis who are abroad are there by choice, primarily
 because of economic opportunities. Some, however, are
 abroad because they oppose the government. The government
 offered amnesty to Somalis abroad who wished to return (it
 being understood that they would not be allowed actively to
 oppose the government if they returned), but only a small
 number of virtually unknown dissidents accepted.
 
 
 229
 Rules concerning travel and emigration ,apply equally to
 both sexes and all social and ethnic groups.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Citizen participation in public affairs is centrally
 directed. The major institutions which mobilize the public
 are the local units of the Somali Socialist Revolutionary
 Party and the mass organizations which are subordinate to
 the party: the General Federation of Somali Trade Unions,
 the Somali women's Democratic Organization, and the
 Somali Revolutionary Youth Union. The scope of popular
 participation expanded marginally with the election of a
 People's Assembly and local assemblies in December, 1979,
 Somalia's first election in ten years. However, the elec-
 tion process consisted of voters casting a yes/no vote for
 or aqainst the single party's candidates.
 In October 1980, President Siad declared a state of
 emergency in accordance of the constitution. The president
 has the authority to suspend those articles of the constitu-
 tion which are incompatible with the emergency situation.
 Under provisions of the state of emergency the Supreme
 Revolutionary Council, which had been abolished when the
 party was created in 1976, has been re-established. The
 council, which is composed of military officers, advises the
 president on policy matters.
 No overt opposition groups exist; they are not permitted.
 All political activity is carried out under the direction
 of the party, and organized criticism of basic government
 policies is forbidden. However, in keeping with Somali
 tradition, both formal and informal consultations do
 occur among the president, the SRC, leading figures of the
 party and government and' also various clan leaders. This
 does provide a mechanism for voicing dissent. No one is
 denied participation or suffrage on the basis of sex, race
 or social background. The Somali Government has advanced
 the status of women considerably in recent years. The
 constitution explicitly confers legal equality on women.
 The government has sought to ensure, mainly through the
 Somali Women's Democratic Organization, greater participa-
 tion by women in areas previously closed to them, notably
 in education and employment.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Interna-
 tional and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no organizations in Somalia concerned with
 human rights violations.
 In 1979 Amnesty International sought permission to visit
 Somalia, but it received no reply from the government.
 Local Amnesty Intenational chapters in the United States
 have sought information from the Somali government regard-
 ing the status of certain of Amnesty International's
 .prisoners of conscience,' but received no response.
 In November1980 Amnesty International issued an urgent
 action appeal on behalf of seven detainees alleged to be
 seriously ill. According to the 1981 Amnesty International
 report, the Somali Government replied that all prisoners
 
 
 230
 were given full medical attention, with regular visits by
 prison doctors.
 A mission of the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) visited Somalia in early 1981 to negotiate arrange-
 ments for the ICRC to fulfill its humanitarian duties with
 regard to visiting prisoners of war and providing medical
 assistance in areas affected by military operations. The
 mission did not achieve these objectives.
 4.    Economic and Social Circumstances
 The government's efforts to fulfill the vital needs of
 its people are hampered by stringent resource limitations.
 Somalia is in the United Nations register of the 28 least
 developed countries. The per capita GNP is $130. It is
 poor in natural resources and some 40 percent of the
 urban population and 70 percent of the rural population
 can be categorized as below the absolute poverty level
 and, thus, cannot afford the minimum diet necessary for
 adequate nutrition. Life expectancy for Somalia's
 largely rural, nomadic population is 43 years. The
 constitution guarantees that "every citizen shall be
 entitled to work.' The government stresses an equitable
 distribution of income. In practice this has meant
 a leveling of incomes, which, together with the disadvan-
 taging of the private sector, has resulted in the exodus
 of a large number of the country's managerial and skilled
 personnel to nearby Arab countries. Corruption exists
 in varying degrees in the governmental and business
 sectors. Over the past decade, the government has devoted.
 substantial resources to educational and social projects
 directed at meeting the needs of its poorer citizens. It
 has succeeded in improving rural health and raising the
 literacy rate through these programs. The World Bank
 estimates that 33 percent of the population has access to
 safe water (up from only 15 percent in 1970). While the
 government has made earnest efforts to improve the
 economic lot of its citizens, its bureaucratic ineffi-
 ciency and doctrinaire approach to problem-solving, and
 the nomadic nature of much of the population, have
 weakened significantly the impact of these efforts.
 Recently the government has begun in a limited way to
 stress development of the private sector, has abolished
 some quasi-governmental organizations and improved incen-
 tives to farmers through increased producer prices. It is
 still too early to assess the impact of these policy
 reforms, however.
