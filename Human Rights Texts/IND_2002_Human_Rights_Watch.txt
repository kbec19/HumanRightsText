INDIA
In 2001, India held steadfast to its distinction as the region’s most stable and
vibrant democracy even as its neighbors underwent dramatic and often
violent shifts in power.With the onset of the war in Afghanistan, and as relations
with Pakistan deteriorated and violence in Kashmir and elsewhere escalated, the
Indian government faced heightened national security concerns. Some measures
taken in response, including the cabinet approval of the Prevention of Terrorism
Ordinance, came under sharp attack by various sectors of Indian civil society for
opportunistically curtailing civil liberties in the name of fighting terrorism.
Increased violence in the state of Uttar Pradesh, where the Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) hopes to achieve a comeback election victory early in
2002, highlighted the dangerous results of exploiting communal and caste tensions
for political ends.
Police violence, attacks on the country’s minority communities including Muslims,
Christians, Dalits and tribals, and violence against women continued to be
serious problems, though some positive steps were taken to help better ensure
women’s and children’s rights. Human rights defenders came under legislative
assault through changes to laws and procedures aimed at restricting their ability to
travel, hold conferences, and receive foreign funds. The U.N. World Conference
Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance
(WCAR), held in South Africa from August 31 to September 8, paved the way for
unprecedented international as well as national scrutiny of the problem of caste
discrimination.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
On January 26, a devastating earthquake rocked the northwest state of Gujarat,
the country’s worst natural disaster in recent history.Within days at least 30,000
were declared dead and over one million were left homeless.While the government
allocated equal amounts of monetary compensation and food supplies to members of all communities, Dalit (so-called untouchable) and Muslim populations did not
have the same access to adequate shelter, electricity, running water, and other supplies
available to others.Upper-caste families in Kutch refused to live alongside Dalits
in temporary settlements built by Rapid Action Forces. As a result, hundreds of
tents lay empty while Dalits were required to live in makeshift shelters. Even relief
kitchens for the two communities had to be kept separate as the higher castes
refused to share resources with those they considered “diseased.”According to local
NGOs, several thousand Dalit homes were also left out of government reconstruction
surveys. In October, Gujarat Chief Minister Keshubhai Patel resigned, in part
because of criticism about the slow pace of relief and rehabilitation following the
earthquake.
Dalit communities continued to suffer systemic discrimination and violence. In
a number of cases, police were complicit in the attacks or used excessive force
against Dalits when they organized to respond to the attacks, rendering legal protections
meaningless. Violence was particularly acute in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar,
and those responsible were rarely brought to justice by the authorities.
On February 19, a group of Thakurs (an upper-caste community) in Lucknow,
Uttar Pradesh, assaulted a Dalit laborer following a wage dispute. The perpetrators
entered the victim’s home and pinned him down while the employer urinated in his
mouth. On June 12, assailants beat a Dalit man and then pushed his wife into a fire,
burning her to death. The incident was quickly followed by a spate of violence,
including a June 14 rampage led by seven Thakurs who killed five members of a
Dalit family, including three women and a ten year-old girl. In Aligarh, Uttar
Pradesh in June a Dalit woman and her five children were burnt alive, allegedly by
the staff of a brick kiln operating unit which had employed the woman and her husband
as bonded laborers.
Conditions in Bihar continued to be marred by a caste war involving rival leftist
factions and upper-caste private militias. In January, fifty houses were set ablaze
and four Dalits were killed in a gun battle. On February 3, rival gangs gunned down
twelve Dalit youths, killing nine of them, and subsequently set their homes on fire;
on April 18, militants belonging to the Maoist Communist Center killed fourteen
Dalits. In August, a village in Patna was attacked, killing six Dalit women and children.
Dalits also continued to face considerable opposition in exercising their political
rights. On October 16 in Dharmapuri district, Tamil Nadu, an entire Dalit village
was razed after Dalits dared to nominate their own candidate to the post of
village council president.More than 140 houses were destroyed by members of the
upper-caste community in the area, rendering eight hundred Dalits homeless.
Many were also physically assaulted during the attacks. One pregnant woman was
kicked in the stomach, aborted her child, and died later that day. Police charged
protesting Dalit villagers with batons and arrested more than twenty-two Dalits
while the upper-caste attackers remained at-large.
Social prohibitions on marriages between higher and lower-caste community
members remained in place and were often reinforced through the threat of social
ostracism and punitive violence. On August 6, 2001, an upper-caste Brahmin boy
and a lower-caste Jat girl in Uttar Pradesh were dragged to the roof of a house and
publicly hanged by members of their own families as hundreds of spectators looked on. The public lynching was punishment for refusing to end an inter-caste relationship.
Also in August, a forty-year-old Dalit woman was paraded naked in Bellary,
Karnataka after being accused of helping a fifteen-year-old upper-caste girl
elope with her lower-caste fiancé.
Dalits were often beaten or fined for participating in religious ceremonies. On
April 3 in Bargarh,Orissa, for example, a Dalit was fined Rs. 4,000 (U.S. $83.42) and
beaten for entering a Hindu temple. On June 2 in Bhadkiyan, Rajasthan, an uppercaste
man beat to death a sixty-five-year-old Dalit man with an iron bar for daring
to pray outside the temple of the village deity.
Attacks on churches and members of the Christian clergy by members of right
wing Hindu groups including the Bajrang Dal, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP),
and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), collectively known as the sangh parivar
continued, peaking in July and August.Christians in Orissa,Gujarat,Rajasthan,
Maharastra,Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh were hardest hit.
On November 26, 2000, four hundred VHP activists in Gujarat desecrated and
took over a church, replacing the church’s cross with Hindu idols and hoisting their
signature saffron flag. The mob also drove out eighty Christian families from the
area, confining them to a nearby forest until they embraced Hinduism.
At St.Anna High School in Bokaro district, Bihar, a dozen armed men assaulted
the principal and three nuns, and raped the school cook on December 3, 2000. In
Tamil Nadu a nun was murdered on January 21, 2001, in the state’s Salem district.
On January 23, in Rampur district,Uttar Pradesh, a nun was hospitalized after sustaining
serious head injuries. Two simultaneous attacks on Christian missionaries
on August 6 in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra drew sharp condemnation from
the All India Christian Council and the Catholic Bishops’Conference of India.
From March 16-18,Muslim youth in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh clashed with state
police during protests over the burning of a Koran in New Delhi by Hindu radicals.
When protesters began to burn an effigy of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee,
police responded with tear gas and the crowd turned violent. Police then opened
fire as rioters began burning shops and hurling crude bombs. By the end of three
days of riots, fourteen people were dead, dozens injured, and eighty-nine arrested.
Six mosques were damaged, Muslim homes were looted, and the authorities had
imposed a round-the-clock curfew. In the wake of the violence, human rights
groups charged the police with using excessive force against Muslim demonstrators
and looting and plundering Muslim shops and homes.
In the hopes of achieving a comeback victory in assembly elections scheduled
for early 2002 in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, the BJP and its allies
amplified calls to build a temple to the Hindu god Ram at the site of the Babri
Masjid, a mosque in the city of Ayodhya whose demolition sparked the infamous
1992-1993 Bombay riots in which thousands of people, most notably Muslims,
were killed. In 2001, many feared that the re-energized Ram temple campaign
would lead to more violence and bloodshed between the state’s Hindu and Muslim
communities.
In July, a crowd of three hundred people demolished a sixteenth century mosque
at Asind near Bhilwara, Rajasthan and built a makeshift Hindu temple in its place.
The mob was encouraged by VHP and RSS activists.
The government took some positive steps to prosecute perpetrators of violence against members of minority religious communities. In May, the Jhabua district
court in Madhya Pradesh sentenced ten men to life in prison for the September
1998 gang-rape of four Christian nuns. Prosecution of Dara Singh, accused in the
1999 murder of Australian missionary Graham Staines and his two sons in Orissa,
also continued,with several witnesses testifying that Singh played a key role in instigating
the murder.
There was little progress, however, in many other cases, including those of individuals
indicted by the Srikrishna Commission for their role in the 1992-93 Bombay
riots. One exception occurred in August, however, when a special task force
filed charges against former police commissioner R.D. Tyagi and seventeen policemen
for their role in 1993 riots in the city.
Control over natural resources continued to be the source of violence against
tribal communities in Orissa. On December 16, 2000, three tribals were killed in
Maikanch village, Rayagada district, in clashes with the police over the villagers’
opposition to a proposed private aluminum plant in the area. A fact-finding team,
which included retired Chief Justice D.S. Tewatia, claimed that the attack was preplanned
and demanded a judicial probe, alleging that an administrative inquiry
ordered by the state government was a “cover-up operation.” On October 30, 2001,
in Rangabhatti village, three tribals were killed and over fifty were injured when
police reportedly opened fire on a gathering of four hundred tribals. The tribals
were protesting against the June 24 killing of two people by an armed mob of 3,000
in Jambodora, a Dalit village. Two more people were killed by police in Raigarhar,
Nabrangpur district on November 11, when over 8,000 women held a rally to
protest the October 30 incident.
Violence against women, including rape, kidnapping, dowry deaths, domestic
violence, female foeticide, sexual harassment, and trafficking continued unabated,
though authorities did take some positive steps in response.
In April, the Supreme Court directed prosecutors to enforce existing laws banning
the use of prenatal diagnostic techniques to determine the sex of the fetus and
authorities warned doctors that their names would be removed from the register of
the Medical Council of India if they were found to be practicing female foeticide.
In June, authorities announced new legislative measures to safeguard women’s
rights, including a new Domestic Violence Prevention Bill.
There were also positive developments for children’s rights. In September, the
government announced that a seven-member national commission for children,
headed by a retired Supreme Court judge,would be established to implement protections
for children enshrined in the Indian constitution. A meeting between
Indian and Bangladeshi border guards in October resulted in agreements to
strengthen cooperation to stop the trafficking of women and children across the
border.According to human rights groups, about 20,000 women and children were
trafficked to India from Bangladesh annually. Also in October, the state government
of Rajasthan, in an attempt to make child marriage illegal, approved legislation
requiring all couples to register marriages with authorities.
In mid-November, the government was considering enacting a modified version
of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA), notorious
for facilitating tens of thousands of politically motivated detentions, torture, and other human rights violations against Muslims, Sikhs, Dalits, trade union
activists, and political opponents in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The new proposed
Prevention of Terrorism Ordinance (POTO) set forth a broad definition of
terrorism that included acts of violence or disruption of essential services carried
out with “intent to threaten the unity and integrity of India or to strike terror in
any part of the people.” It also made it a crime not to provide authorities with
“information relating to any terrorist activity,” and allowed for up to three months
of preventive detention without charge. The ordinance came under sharp attack
from civil rights groups, academics, lawyers, opposition parties, media organizations,
and both religious and secular institutions. The National Human Rights
Commission also maintained that existing laws were sufficient to fight the threat
of terrorism.
Freedom of assembly nationwide suffered following the beginning of U.S.-led
air strikes in Afghanistan on October 7, with student groups and organizations
protesting India’s backing of the U.S.-led campaign facing increased harassment
from the police. On October 28, seven anti-U.S. protestors were killed when police
opened fire on demonstrators in Malegaon,Maharashtra. Local police reportedly
had tried to prevent a small group of Muslim protestors from distributing leaflets
calling on people to boycott U.S.-made goods and to oppose air strikes in Afghanistan.
Authorities claimed that protestors began throwing stones, leading first to a
police baton-charge and then police shooting. Three more people were killed the
following night when protestors tried to block the main road connecting Malegaon
to the capital,Delhi. Police said they used baton charges and tear gas to disperse the
crowd and only fired at protestors when that failed.
The government drew sharp criticism from numerous minority groups for
selectively banning the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) as part of its
post-September 11 actions to counter terrorism while ignoring the “anti-national”
activities of right-wing Hindu groups.At least four people were killed when police
opened fire on a protest in Lucknow on September 27 following the arrest of some
SIMI activists.
Insurgency and increased ethnic violence took a heavy toll in Assam and other
northeastern states. In January, the United Liberation Front (ULFA) of Assam that
advocates the establishment of a “sovereign socialist Assam” by armed force was
blamed for a number of killings and bombings to disrupt elections and protest
Republic Day celebrations. The group was also believed responsible for killing a
ruling party leader, ten activists, and six political leaders in the run-up to elections
in May. Indian federal troops killed at least five ULFA militants in response. In June,
protestors opposed to any concessions to Naga rebels in Manipur burned the state
legislature building and a former chief minister’s home after the government
extended a truce with the rebels.
The conflict in Kashmir remained a flashpoint for violence, as all parties failed
to protect civilian non-combatants. On November 19, 2000, Prime Minister Vajpayee
declared a unilateral ceasefire, but, shortly thereafter, Jammu and Kashmir
police chief A.K. Suri announced that the ceasefire would not affect police counterinsurgency
operations. Indian security personnel continued to target Muslim
citizens suspected of supporting guerrillas. Arbitrary arrests, torture, and staged “encounter killings” were reported throughout the year, both when the ceasefire
was in effect and after it was lifted on May 23, 2001.
India, like Pakistan, continued to deny political rights and to restrict freedoms
of expression and assembly in Jammu and Kashmir. At least six people were killed
when security personnel opened fire on demonstrators in Haigam and Maisuma in
February. On February 15 in Haigam, forty kilometers north of Srinagar, five
people were killed when Indian troops opened fire on demonstrators protesting the
alleged killing of pro-independence activist Jalil Ahmed Shah in police custody the
day before. In Maisuma, Srinagar on February 16, one person was killed in a similar
incident. In both cases the police maintained that they were firing in selfdefense.
On May 10, seventeen journalists were beaten by troops of the Indian Border
Security Force (BSF) in Magam. The assault took place while the journalists were
covering a suicide bomb attack against a BSF camp. The officers implicated were
subsequently recalled from Kashmir but as of mid-November no disciplinary
action had been taken against them.
July also witnessed a dramatic upsurge in violence in Kashmir with almost two
hundred reported deaths in the week following the failed Agra summit between
Prime Minister Vajpayee and Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf. On July 22, fifteen
Hindu villagers were killed by suspected Islamic militants in Doda district.The
attacks came a day after thirteen Hindus were killed while on pilgrimage.
Tensions flared up again after the September 11 attacks on the United States.On
October 1, at least thirty-eight people were killed when a suicide attacker drove a
hijacked government jeep to the main entrance of the state assembly in Srinagar
and detonated explosives loaded in the car.The Pakistan-based Jaish-e Mohammad
militant group claimed responsibility for the attack but then retracted the following
day.
In the weeks that followed, numerous militants and security personnel were
killed in tit-for-tat attacks while tensions heated up along the Line of Control
between the Indian and Pakistan-controlled portions of the territory.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
The brutal killings of two members of the Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties Committee
(APCLC) within a period of four months sent shock waves throughout the
human rights community. In November 2000, T. Puroshottam, Joint Secretary of
APCLC was stabbed to death by a group of unidentified men. Puroshottam had
been a leading monitor of police abuses. In February 2001, Azam Ali, the district
secretary of the Nalgonda branch of APCLC, was hacked to death by two swordwielding
youth.Despite demands from human rights organizations and allegations
that police hired former members of armed groups to carry out the attacks, by
November 2001 the government had yet to conduct any judicial inquiry.
On July 7 police raided the offices of Bharosa Trust and the Naz Foundation
International in Lucknow, organizations that work on HIV/AIDS prevention,
arresting several staff members. Although subsequently released on bail, the staff members were charged under article 377 of the Indian Penal Code, a provision that
prohibits “carnal intercourse against the order of nature.”Article 377 has been used
repeatedly to justify discrimination and police brutality against gay, lesbian, and
bisexual individuals.
The Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA), one of India’s largest peoples’ movements,
continued to protest the construction of large dams on the Narmada river
in central India. Protesters highlighting the impact of the project on millions of
river valley residents and the government’s failure to adequately rehabilitate
affected families continued to face harassment,police abuse, and contempt charges.
The work of rights activists was also hindered by restrictive laws and regulations.
In July, the Supreme Court upheld the validity of a Union Home Ministry order
requiring that organizations obtain clearance from the ministry before holding
international conferences, seminars or workshops if the subject matter was “political,
semi-political, communal or religious in nature or is related to human rights.”
On October 23, President K.R. Narayanan signed an ordinance empowering both
central and state governments to suspend the passports and travel documents of
any suspected terrorist, militant or “anti-national element,” or any person suspected
of having links with terrorist organizations.At this writing, a bill amending
the Indian Passports Act, 1967 to reflect these changes was being considered during
Indian parliament’s winter session.Many human rights activists have been labeled
by authorities as “anti-national elements.”
The National Human Rights Commission continued to highlight the need for
more effective implementation of laws on bonded labor and manual scavenging
and issued several directives to state governments to compensate the victims of
police and military atrocities. In total, the commission received 71,685 complaints
alleging human rights violations in 2000-2001, 41,984 of which were from Uttar
Pradesh. State human rights commissions were also set up in Maharashtra and
Chattisgarh.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
The year saw a much-heightened international focus on the plight of India’s 160
million Dalits. In August 2001, U.N. Subcommission on the Promotion and Protection
ofHuman Rights expert R.K.W.Goonesekere presented a working paper on
work and descent-based discrimination, or caste discrimination, to the subcommission’s
fifty-third session. The presentation of the paper, and the ensuing debate
amongst subcommission experts that followed, marked the first time that caste discrimination
worldwide was treated as a serious rights violation by a U.N. human
rights body.
The WCAR held in Durban, South Africa in September, was a watershed for the
Dalit movement and for the rights of “untouchables” and other so-called lowercaste
communities worldwide. The Dalit contingent of more than 160 activists, led
by India’s National Campaign for Dalit Human Rights, was one of the largest at the conference and drew strong international support from governments, India’s
National Human Rights Commission, and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
Dalit NGO efforts met with considerable resistance from the Indian government,
which maintained that caste discrimination was an internal matter and used its
political and economic leverage to censor any mention of caste in WCAR documents.
In the run up to the conference, journalists, anthropologists, political parties,
and others in India joined an increasingly mainstream debate on caste
discrimination as an issue of international concern. The conference also highlighted
caste discrimination as a global phenomenon affecting many Asian and
African countries.
United States
The U.S. walked a tightrope in its relations with India and Pakistan following the
September 11 attacks. India lobbied hard to ensure that the U.S.’ campaign against
terrorism would include militants in Kashmir.
After September 11, the Bush White House accelerated the Clinton administration’s
moves towards closer political and economic relations with India. On September
22, the U.S. lifted the sanctions imposed against India and Pakistan in the
wake of nuclear testing by both nations in May 1998, allowing resumption of military
equipment sales. The administration planned to increase funding for international
military education and training (IMET) of Indian officers from $500,000 to
$650,000 in the fiscal year 2002. It also planned a boost in bilateral economic assistance
from $5 million to $7 million.
On November 9 President Bush met with Prime Minister Vajpayee. The U.S.
renewed its offer to facilitate talks between India and Pakistan on Kashmir but
made no public comments on the Prevention of Terrorism Ordinance.
The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom urged the Indian
government in May 2001 to more swiftly and explicitly condemn and counteract
increasing violence directed towards Christian populations. The panel voiced concern
that the government’s lack of decisive action created an atmosphere that
invited inter-religious violence.
European Union
The E.U.welcomed the July Agra summit between India and Pakistan.Although
the summit did not reach any resolution, the E.U. urged both countries to continue
their dialogue—a dialogue that seemed far out of reach by mid-November.
In its annual Human Rights Report, the European Parliament called upon the
E.U. to investigate the extent to which its policies “contribute to the abolition of
caste discrimination and the practice of untouchability in India” and “to formulate
strategies to counter the widespread practice [of caste discrimination].” A subsequent
parliamentary resolution expressed regret that the final declaration of the
World Conference Against Racism failed to highlight caste discrimination.
At this writing, the E.U. and India were preparing for a second annual summit
to be held in New Delhi on November 23.
Japan
On October 26 Japan announced that it too would lift sanctions against India
and Pakistan imposed after the 1998 nuclear tests, citing both countries’“efforts to
contribute to strengthening the international coalition against terrorism” and
increased instability in the region as a result of U.S.-led military strikes in Afghanistan.
World Bank
India continued to be the World Bank’s largest borrower. In June 2001 the
World Bank sanctioned four loans and credits to the government of India totaling
U.S. $913.8 million, for a total lending of U.S. $2.5 billion for the fiscal year (FY)
2001.
The U.S. Foreign Aid Bill for the FY 2002 instructed the United States executive
director at the World Bank to vote against any water or sewage project in India that
did not prohibit the use of scavenger labor. Though prohibited by law, the government
of India employs a majority of the country’s estimated one million Dalit
manual scavengers for the cleaning of non-flush public latrines.
In an August meeting in Delhi, Indian groups joined trade union leaders from
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal to formulate a regional stance against
IMF and World Bank policies that reduce jobs and increase layoffs.Over 160 delegates
took part in the four-day seminar that also focused on the impact of the World
Trade Organization on the developing world.
