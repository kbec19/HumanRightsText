 SIERRA LEONE
 Established at the end of the eighteenth century as a
 private colony for freed slaves, Freetown became a British
 crown colony in 1808. In 1896, the British government
 placed the rest of what is now Sierra Leone under its
 protection. For most of the pre-independence period Sierra
 Leone remained two entities, a colony and protectorate.
 The colony, i.e., Freetown and the Peninsula, was endowed
 with schools, as well as the first institution of higher
 learning in British West Africa (1827). It produced, in the
 nineteenth century, a local educated elite that included
 doctors, lawyers and ministers. The protectorate fared less
 well. Only since independence, in 1961, has education
 become reasonably available throughout the country.
 Tribal and sectional rivalries have been in part the cause
 of past political difficulties, culminating in military
 intervention when the first governing party (closely
 associated with one ethnic group) attempted to forestall
 assumption of office in 1967 by the newly-designated prime
 minister from the erstwhile opposition party. After a year
 of military rule the civilian system was resumed with the
 then prime minister (the current president), Siaka Stevens,
 at the head. These ethnic and party problems served as the
 rationale for the establishment of a one-party state by
 promulgation of a new constitution in July 1978 after a
 national referendum. The single party, the All People's
 Congress (APC), has sought to enlarge its base and to
 encompass previous opposition leaders, some of whom have
 been given significant government and party positions.
 There is, however, continuing opposition to the APC and
 to the head of state, reflected in dissident groups active
 in tne United States and the United Kingdom.
 In August 1981 a confrontation developed between the
 government and the Sierra Leone Labour Congress (SLLC) over
 the latter's calls for economic reforms. The SLLC called
 a short-lived national strike in mid-August and, after
 negotiations between the government and the SLLC broke
 down late in the month, organized a second general strike
 on September 1. As a result of the second strike call,
 President Stevens declared a state of emergency for a
 three-month period beginning September 1, which was renewed
 for three months December 11. In connection with the state
 of emergency, 179 persons, including labor leaders and
 journalists, were detained without charge for periods
 ranging up to one month.
 Sierra Leone is a poor country with an annual per capita
 gross national product of $250. The economy has stagnated
 in recent years (the result of declining mineral production,
 a historic neglect of agriculture, rising energy costs,
 weather and pest problems in late 1978 and early 1979, and
 heavy expenditures on the 1980 Organization of African
 Unity summit meeting), which reduced the government's
 capacity to undertake social welfare programs.

 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There is no evidence of the use of torture in Sierra Leone.
 It is specifically prohibited by the constitution.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There have been no reports of cruel, inhuman or degrading
 treatment or punishment. The constitution prohibits "any
 punishment or other treatment which is inhuman or degrading."
 As far as is known, health care is adequate in prisons and
 inmates are allowed family visits, although this right was
 abridged in the case of persons detained under the state of
 emergency orders in September.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no reports of abductions, secret arrests or
 clandestine detentions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Under the constitution promulgated in 1978, the president may
 take measures to detain any person who is, or is reasonably
 suspected to be, dangerous to the well-being of the republic.
 A state of public emergency must come into force within 28
 days after the detention, or a detainee not charged with an
 offense must be released. If an emergency is declared there
 are virtually no restrictions on detention. During the state
 of emergency declared September 1, 1981, 179 persons were
 detained for up to one month. All detainees were released
 uncharged by October 4, 1981.
 a. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 All persons charged with a criminal offense are entitled to
 a fair hearing within a reasonable time by an independent
 and impartial court established by law. Defendants are
 allowed counsel of their choice. Sierra Leone's courts have
 a good reputation for providing fair public trials. Persons
 detained under the Public Emergency Act are not guaranteed a
 fair hearing (unless charged with a criminal offense) and
 their acquittal after usual constitutional procedures does
 not ensure release from detention.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 There are legal safeguards, which are generally observed,
 against arbitrary invasion of the home. There were
 reports that instances of invasion of the home took place
 following the September declaration of a state of emergency.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of religion is observed and constitutionally
 guaranteed. Freedom of speech is legally guaranteed,
 but under the constitution this freedom can be abridged
 if the proper functioning of the recognized party (APC)
 is deemed in jeopardy. Freedom of assembly is legally
 protected under normal circumstances, but under the
 
 
 223
 constitution this freedom can be restricted as was the
 case when the government banned a mass meeting called by
 the SLLC in mid-August, 1981. There is no opposition
 and thus no opposition press per se, but there are a few
 independent newspapers which print stories critical of
 the government and contain articles which do not appear
 in the government-controlled media. The office of the
 most prominent of these independent newspapers was ran-
 sacked and its printing press destroyed oy government
 supporters at the onset of the September national strike.
 Journalists were among those detained by the government
 during the state of emergency.   Prior to calling tor
 national strikes in August and Septemoer, labor orga-
 nizations were allowed to operate freely and were not
 subjected to government control. The headquarters
 building of the SLLC was ransacked by government sup-
 porters at the beginning of the September I national
 strike, and the youth wing of the ruling party took
 temporary control of the building. The headquarters
 was returned to SLLC control upon the release of SLLC
 officials from detention, and the SLLC has resumed its
 activities. Like other organizations and individuals, it
 is subject to the state of emergency declared September 1
 and renewed December 11.
 o. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The major official restriction on travel within the country
 is intendeo to control smuggling in diamond mining areas of
 Kono district. There are numerous police check points on
 major provincial roads. Regulations governing foreign
 travel are liberal, and there are minimal legal restrictions
 on emigration. There are no constitutional restrictions
 on repatriation.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Sierra Leone received independence in 1961 as a parliamen-
 tary democracy, and was at first nailed as an example of
 a working democracy in Africa. Political development was
 arrested in 1967 y a series of military interventions  w
 and attempts at intervention in the political process.
 Civilian government was restored in 1968, and in elections
 in 1973 and 1977 the APC became the dominant political
 force. Following a national referendum in 1978, a consti-
 tution. establishing a one-party state was promulgated,
 with the APC as the onlylegal political party.
 Political activity within the ruling APC party increased
 during the course of 1981 as it became clear that national
 elections would be called in 1982. Additionally, a
 committee was formed to re-write the party constitution
 so that it could carry out its responsibilities under the
 1978 constitution. Within the constraints of a one-party
 state there is universal suffrage and no groups are dis-
 criminated against because of sex, ethnic, communal, racial
 or religious factors. Members of former opposition parties
 hold significant positions with the government and party.
 Women in Sierra Leone are entitled to all rights guaranteed
 by the constitution. In practice, however, the status of
 women varies substantially in different parts of the country.
 In the modern sector, women occupy such prominent posts as
 cabinet minister and supreme court justice, while in remote
 areas they traditionally have a more subordinate role. Even
 in the provincial areas, however, women can fill roles of
 significant status, such as paramount chief of a district.
 On both official and unofficial levels, increasing attention
 is being paid to the role of women in political and profes-
 sional activities.

 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no known requests in recent years for outside
 investigation of human rights violations.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Sierra Leone, with a per capita GNP of $250, is a relatively
 poor land with large disparities in levels of income, educa-
 tion, access to health services and the overall quality of
 life. The majority of Sierra Leone's population, which is
 over 70 percent rural, could be categorized as absolutely poor.
 In fact, 65 percent of the rural population falls below the
 absolute poverty level. Those disparities that do exist are
 not because of tribal, ethnic or religious discrimination,
 although the absolute poor are found disproportionately among
 African-surnamed (i.e., tribal) Sierra Leoneans. The tribal
 Sierra Leoneans tend to be of Moslem or animistic religious
 backgrounds and are decidely more rural than the other more
 privileged groups, which are overwhelmingly urban. Perhaps
 the greatest disparity in the quality of life in Sierra Leone
 is between those in the rural area and all but the poorest
 urban dwellers, a fact which is the main contributor to urban
 in-migration. For example, only 1 percent of the rural
 population has access to safe drinking water compared with
 75 percent of the urban population. While adult literacy
 has more than doubled to 15 percent over a decade and total
 primary school enrollment has risen to 37 percent, rural areas
 are short of schools and are staffed by a large percentage of
 unqualified instructors, some of whom may not have gone beyond
 even a seventh grade education themselves. This causes
 families interested in their children's education and upward
 social mobility to move to Freetown or send their children to
 live with relatives in Freetown. Development in general has
 been concentrated in the Preetown/Western area, an imbalance
 that was further increased by infrastructural improvements
 made in preparation for the 1980 Organization of African Unity
 conference.
 Widespread corruption in all parts of the country has the
 effect of denying adequate medical care and nutrition to
 the poor, who often must pay bribes to obtain what should
 be free medical care, and who suffer most from the activi-
 ties of those who make a practice of profiteering in the
 retailing of basic foodstuffs. Resultant malnutrition
 (the average Sierra Leonean's daily calories supply has
 declined to only 93 percent of nutritional requirements)
 and poor health care have helped to give Sierra Leone an
 infant mortality rate of 136 per 1000 live births, one
 of the highest rates in the world. Nevertheless, life
 expectancy at birth has increased to 47.5 years. With
 increased life expectancy and a fertility rate of 6.1
 births per woman, the population growth rate has increased
 to 2.5 percent per year.
