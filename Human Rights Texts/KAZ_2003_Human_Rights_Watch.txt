KAZAKHSTAN
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
The human rights situation in Kazakhstan generated alarm as the government
in 2002 struck out at critical media and opposition politicians in an apparent effort
to shield itself from pressure for reform.
Kazakh government repression of independent media reached crisis proportions,
as journalists were attacked and beaten, threatened with death, and jailed.
Media outlets connected to President Nursultan Nazarbaev’s political rivals, and
journalists who attempted to expose official corruption, were particular targets of
the crackdown.
In May, the twenty-five-year-old daughter of independent journalist Lira Baiseitova
“disappeared” the day after the journalist published a controversial piece in
the newspaper SolDat (Let Me Speak) regarding personal Swiss bank accounts
allegedly held by the Nazarbaev family. In June, police informed Baiseitova that her
daughter, Leila, had been arrested for heroin possession, but did not grant the two
a visit. Days later, Leila Baiseitova died in police custody; Lira Baiseitova received
conflicting reports about the cause of death, including a police claim that her
daughter had hanged herself in her cell. Lira Baiseitova had herself been the victim
of physical attacks in 2000 and 2001.
On August 28, unknown assailants beat independent journalist Sergei Duvanov
unconscious; he was hospitalized for head trauma and other injuries. The attack
was clearly aimed at silencing Duvanov and intimidating other independent journalists.
On May 6, an Internet publication had posted a controversial article by
Duvanov about corruption on the part of President Nazarbaev and his close circle.
On July 9, officers of the National Security Committee (KNB) interrogated
Duvanov about his Internet article and filed criminal charges against him for “violating
the honor and dignity of the President.” By October, a police investigation
had failed to identify the assailants. On October 28, police arrested Duvanov on
charges of sexual assault of a minor. Duvanov had been scheduled to leave the following
day for the United States (U.S.), where he was to have given a series of lectures
on the state of media freedoms in Kazakhstan.
The August assault on Duvanov came twelve days after a similar attack on Artur
Platanov, a television reporter, who was beaten outside his home and suffered
injuries requiring hospital treatment. Human rights groups reported that police
identified the assailants as three former police officers. Platonov’s recent reporting
had addressed allegations of government corruption and the suspicious circumstances
surrounding the death of Leila Baiseitova.
In May, unknown intruders to the SolDat premises beat and seriously injured
employees, stole equipment, and threatened a repeat attack if the paper continued
publishing. Authorities blamed “drug addicts” for the crime, and at this writing
Human Rights Watch was not aware of any further state investigation into the incident. The paper is said to be affiliated with the opposition Republican People’s
Party, led by former Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin.
The same month a firebombing destroyed the offices of another newspaper,
Respublika.Police reportedly failed to investigate the incident seriously, and instead
briefly detained the paper’s co-founder, Muratbek Ketebaev, on charges—later
dropped—that he had hired people to carry out the firebombing; the case remains
under investigation. Prior to the attack, the newspaper’s editor, Irina Petrushova,
had received a funeral wreath with her name on it, and had found a decapitated dog
hanging outside the newspaper’s office reportedly bearing a note saying “there will
be no next time.” Respublika journalists had been investigating allegations of government
corruption, including the Nazarbaev family Swiss bank accounts story.
On July 4, Petrushova, who is not a citizen of Kazakhstan, received an eighteenmonth
suspended prison sentence for working in Kazakhstan illegally.Work permit
rules for citizens of most countries of the former Soviet Union are usually
enforced only with regard to sensitive government posts, and violations punished
by a fine. According to the Reuters news agency, Petrushova left Kazakhstan at the
end of August.
Also in 2002, the seven-year-old Rifma radio station, the first independent radio
station in Aktiubinsk province, was closed after government officials successfully
petitioned to have the broadcaster’s license revoked for “deliberately and blatantly”
violating the law on languages. By law, at least 50 percent of a station’s programs
must be in Kazakh. Authorities suspended the license of private television station
Tan in March for alleged violations of the language law as well as “technical problems.”
Opposition politician Mukhtar Abliazov, named in media reports as a shareholder
and co-founder of Tan, and one of the co-founders of the nascent Democratic
Choice of Kazakhstan (DVK) opposition party established in November
2001, was arrested on March 28.He was sentenced on July 18 to six years in jail on
charges of abuse of office while serving as minister of energy from 1997 to 1999.
Galymzhan Zhakianov, the other DVK co-founder, was sentenced on August 2 to
seven years of imprisonment for alleged abuse of office while serving as governor
of Pavlodar province. The two men and their supporters argued that the government
fabricated the cases against them to remove them as serious challengers to
Nazarbaev.Others viewed the case as another example of the selective prosecutions
that target the dissident elite.
Senate elections held October 8 were allegedly marred by procedural violations.
Authorities denied registration to the DVK candidate from Pavlodar, Gennadi
Bondarenko.
President Nazarbaev continued to consolidate economic and financial power
while severely curtailing public inquiry into the alleged misuse of government oil
revenues. Government harassment of the independent media was partially attributed
to revelations in late 2001 and early 2002 that the government secretly held
approximately U.S.$1.4 billion in a Swiss bank account under Nazarbaev’s control.
After repeated government denials, on April 4 Prime Minister Imangaly Tasmagambetov
confirmed the existence of the account and explained how it was
used.However,Tasmagambetov did not respond to parliamentary questions about the existence of personal Swiss accounts in the name of Nazarbaev and his relatives.
A U.S. federal judge ruled on September 9 that the Kazakh government could
not prevent a federal grand jury from reviewing some three hundred thousand
pages of documents related to a corruption investigation involving Kazakh government
officials and James Giffen, a close associate of Nazarbaev and financial
advisor to the Kazakh government. The government had requested that the documents
be suppressed on the grounds of sovereign immunity. The investigation
stemmed from information that the U.S.Department of Justice (DOJ) had received
from Swiss authorities in 2000 regarding the “alleged use of U.S. banks to funnel
funds belonging to certain oil companies through Swiss bank accounts and shell
companies… for ultimate transfer to… high-ranking officials of Kazakhstan.”The
DOJ documented transfers totaling almost U.S.$115 million from March 1997 to
September 1998 allegedly from several international oil companies through Giffen
to the president and former government officials.
The Kazakh government removed some of the most restrictive language in its
law on religion, bringing it closer to international standards. For example, the registration
requirement for those seeking to conduct missionary activity was lifted for
Kazakh citizens.
However, police and prosecutors sought to punish those who engaged in religious
activity but were affiliated with unregistered religious groups. For example,
on February 15 police reportedly arrested Tursunbai Auelbekov for distributing
Baptist literature in a market. The prosecutor intended to bring charges against
Auelbekov, but desisted upon learning of his poor health; he was subsequently
released.While in the majority of cases Baptist believers from unregistered groups
were penalized with administrative fines, in October 2001 authorities sentenced
Pastor Valeri Pak to five days of imprisonment for ignoring an earlier order to halt
his church’s activities. In a particularly disturbing case, on October 27, 2001 police
in Kyzl-Orda province beat Asylbek Nurdanov, the leader of an unregistered Baptist
church, and forcibly committed him to a mental institution; he was released on
November 16.
Some of the harshest government action to repress religious freedom was
reserved for members of Hizb ut-Tahrir (Party of Liberation) a non-violent group
that advocates the re-establishment of the Islamic Caliphate or state. At least two
dozen members of the group were detained in Kazakhstan in late 2001 and 2002 for
distribution of Hizb ut-Tahrir leaflets. Uzbek citizens arrested for membership in
the group were extradited to Uzbekistan,where they were sentenced to long prison
terms.Others were fined or given prison sentences of up to four years, according to
press reports. One alleged member, Kanat Beiembetov, died in custody as a result
of ill-treatment by KNB agents on November 6, 2001, eleven days after his arrest.
The officers responsible for his death were reportedly dismissed.
Kazakh courts continued to sentence people to death. As of June some forty
people were reportedly on death row awaiting execution.
The government took several steps during the year to address a rapidly escalating
HIV/AIDS epidemic, including a directive abolishing the long-standing practice
of compulsory HIV testing for all persons in pre-trial detention.Unfortunately,
by October the Ministry of Internal Affairs—which oversees such facilities—still had not implemented this directive. Injecting drug users—the most heavily AIDSaffected
population group in the country—and commercial sex workers continued
routinely to face police abuse and lack of due process. These factors contributed to
their lack of access to preventive HIV services. Persons living with HIV/AIDS continued
to experience severe discrimination in access to health care, housing, and
employment.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
In September 2002, the government created an ombudsman’s office to monitor
and take steps to remedy human rights violations.The potential effectiveness of the
office appeared to be undermined from the outset, however, as founding legislation
specified that the ombudsman would be prohibited from “interfering” in court
proceedings or the routine operation of law enforcement agencies.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
Kazakhstan remained the only country in the region that was not a state party to
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or to the International
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Office for
Democratic Institutions and Human Rights expert advisory panel on freedom of
religion or belief reviewed Kazakhstan’s new law on freedom of religion and religious
associations and was successful in improving its protection of religious freedoms.
Cooperation between the government and OSCE was commendable in this
area.
The OSCE representative on freedom of the media issued a report in June
expressing alarm at attacks on the media in Kazakhstan.He also spoke out strongly
against the assault on Sergei Duvanov, calling for his attackers to be brought to justice.
European Union
In July, the E.U. reported that its 2002 Cooperation Council meeting with Kazakhstan
had emphasized respect for human rights as an “essential condition” for
Kazakhstan-E.U. cooperation. The E.U. statement mentioned violent attacks on
the media, and expressed concern regarding “the number of court cases against
non-governmental media and opposition.” It also noted the need for a “transparent”
judicial system to address the problem of corruption.
The E.U. encouraged Kazakhstan to ensure broader political pluralism, but the
Kazakh government took no discernible action in response.The E.U. used an OSCE
Permanent Council meeting in late July to express concern about the new law on
political parties, saying that it “pose[d] a threat to political pluralism” and would
“impede the full development of political parties in all sectors of Kazakh society.”
United States
U.S. President George W. Bush reportedly raised human rights issues during his
December 2001 meeting with President Nazarbaev. But since the White House
made no public statement to this effect, Nazarbaev was able to use the meeting to
show that he had unqualified U.S. support.At the close of the visit, the Bush administration
promised to seek Kazakhstan’s “graduation” from the Jackson-Vanik
amendment to the U.S. Freedom Support Act, which denies “most favored nation”
trade status to countries that restrict freedom of emigration.
As the crackdown against the Kazakh media and political opposition intensified,
the Bush administration’s frustration with the Kazakh government appeared to
grow. In August, a State Department spokesman stated that “recent developments…
pose a serious threat to the country’s democratic process” and promised
that the U.S.would “raise these concerns at the highest levels with the Government
of Kazakhstan.”
The U.S. risked sending mixed signals to Kazakhstan, however, by simultaneously
pursuing closer military ties, culminating in a July agreement giving U.S. aircraft
landing rights at Almaty airport.
In September, U.S. government officials took the lead in an international effort
to convince Kazakh authorities not to extradite Gulgeldi Annaniazov, a Turkmen
dissident in Kazakh custody, to Turkmenistan.Annaniazov was granted refugee status
by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and was
able to travel to Norway for medical treatment in early October.
