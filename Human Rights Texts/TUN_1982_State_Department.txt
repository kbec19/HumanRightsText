 TUNISIA
 Tunisia is a developing country whose Arab heritage has also
 been influenced by its North African location and its close
 association with the West. Ruled by the Destourian Socialist
 Party since independence in 1956, it has prospered economi-
 cally and politically. The Tunisian political system is
 dominated by the personality of President-for-Life Habib
 Bourguiba, but its Constitution provides for institutions of
 a parliamentary democracy, and its political atmosphere is
 one of relative openness and tolerance. Socially, it is one
 of the most progressive countries in the Arab world,
 especially concerning the rights and privileges of women.
 Bourguiba's Socialist Destourian Party fosters both private
 enterprise and state-run and quasi-autonomous companies and
 industries.
 The Tunisian Trade Union Movement, which languished after its
 leaders were jailed in 1978, has now largely resumed its role
 as an independent, representative organization engaged in
 collective bargaining on behalf of Tunisian workers. Leading
 members of the Tunisian Islamic fundamentalist movement,
 convicted in 1981 on charges of unauthorized political
 activity, remain incarcerated. Local human rights
 organizations played an active role in the advocacy of human
 rights in Tunisia during 1982.
 Political opposition groups, which have unsuccessfully sought
 government recognition as legal political parties, remain
 limited in their political activities, due in part to their
 inability to gain official status. The small Communist
 Party, which obtained government assent to resumption of its
 operations in 1981, carried on a standard program of
 political action. Regular criticism of the Government
 continued to appear in opposition and independent
 publications, although government press censorship resulted
 in some seizures and ultimately in the suspension of two
 weekly reviews.
 There were no significant changes in the Tunisian human
 rights situation in 1982 and none are anticipated for the
 short term future.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 Summary execution and politically-motivated murders did not
 occur in Tunisia in 1982.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no allegations that government security forces
 engaged in kidnappings, midnight arrests, or secret
 detentions in 1982.
 c. Torture
 Tunisian law does not specifically proscribe torture, but the
 Constitution guarantees the integrity of the person. In
 December 1982, the Tunisian Human Rights League, a non-
 governmental organization, expressed deep concern over
 charges that a group of ten prisoners accused of planning
 acts of violence were tortured during their detention by
 security authorities. The league said that it was
 investigating the charges. In 1981, following the arrest of
 
 
 1289
 leading Islamic activists, there were allegations that they
 had been subjected to physical abuse by police during
 interrogation. In responding to the 1981 charges, Tunisian
 officials affirmed that the Government did not condone the
 use of torture or physical abuse and that, if it occurred, it
 was the result of misconduct on the part of individuals.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Conditions in some Tunisian prisons are poor and have drawn
 criticism from local legal and human rights organizations.
 At one point, family and friends of convicted Islamic
 fundamentalists charged that harsh prison conditions had
 deleterious mental and physical effects on the group,
 particularly on the two leaders of the movement. The
 complaints resulted in a visit by the Interior Minister to
 inspect prison conditions and to verify the adequacy of
 medical care.
 Physical punishment as a corrective measure is not provided
 for under Tunisian law; there were no allegations of such
 practices in 1982.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Tunisian law grants broad discretionary detainment authority
 to law enforcement officers and allows persons suspected of
 major offenses (those punishable by imprisonment for more
 than one year) to be detained without trial for an unlimited
 investigative period before being charged or released. There
 is no information indicating systematic abuse of this
 authority. Felony suspects may be held for investigation
 without trial. Persons suspected of misdemeanors may be held
 for up to five days for questioning. Bookings may be made on
 the basis of suspicion alone, but continued detention
 requires a formal warrant. Tunisian practice dictates that a
 prisoner's whereabouts must be made known to legal counsel
 and to family; access is rarely denied for more than a few
 days. An exception to this practice occurred in 1981, when
 Islamic activists were not permitted outside contact for
 approximately a month. In October 1982 ten persons charged
 with planning to commit acts of violence were arrested and
 held for over one month by security authorities before being
 handed over to judicial authorities and given access to
 lawyers and families.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Tunisian Constitution stipulates that "each person will
 be considered innocent until proven guilty in a court where
 he is guaranteed the necessary conditions for self-defense."
 The courts appoint attorneys for accused persons who, for
 whatever reason, do not have counsel. Most trials are heard
 in regular civilian law courts, which consist of courts of
 first instance, appellate courts, and a Supreme Court (of
 appeals). A 1968 law provides for the formation of ad hoc
 state security courts to hear cases involving crimes against
 the security of the state. A 1970 law established the legal
 basis for constituting a high court, when necessary, to try
 government officials for treason. A standing military
 tribunal hears cases involving members of the armed forces or
 cases of a military nature. Each system provides for
 appellate procedures, with the exception of the high court,
 where judgment is final.
 The right to a public trial is respected, and charges are
 made known to both the accused and his counsel before the
 trial. The 1981 trial of Islamic fundamentalists was held in
 open session in a regular court. Pre-trial public commentary
 tended to prejudice the outcome. However, defense lawyers
 
 
 1290
 were allowed to argue that the charges were political in
 nature, and the trial received full coverage in the press.
 The 1978 State Security Court conviction of Tunisia's trade
 union leaders for alleged complicity in the riots that year
 was overturned by a Tunisian administrative court in April
 1982 on technical grounds.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Search warrants must be obtained from the Ministry of Justice
 in order to enter premises. There were no allegations in
 1982 that there had been violations of the respect Tunisia
 traditionally accords to the sanctity of the home or to the
 privacy of personal correspondence.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Magazines published by opposition and independent groups are
 permitted to appear side-by-side with those of the ruling
 Destourian Socialist Party, but are required to limit
 criticism of government policies and avoid attacking
 President Bourguiba, senior officials of the Tunisian
 Government, or the nature of the Tunisian state. According
 to the Tunisian press code, publications failing to observe
 these proscriptions may be seized or suspended altogether.
 Seizures and suspensions occurred in both 1981 and 1982.
 No publication may be printed or sold in Tunisia without a
 government permit. The numerous foreign periodicals locally
 available are subject to censorship and are seized from time
 to time. The Government owns and controls the radio and
 television stations. There were no allegations of the
 violation of academic freedoms in 1982.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of association is guaranteed by Tunisia's
 constitution and reaffirmed by its ratification of the
 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The General Union of
 Tunisian Workers meets regularly with its constitutents and
 exercises the right to strike and organize. In 1982 strikes,
 generally of short duration, were frequent. Approxi-
 mately 20 percent of Tunisian workers are organized. In
 1982, the General Union attended the International Labor
 Organization meeting in Geneva. It is affiliated with the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and with the
 International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions.
 Opposition political groups which have unsuccessfully sought
 authorization from the Government to operate as legal parties
 remain limited in the political activities they may
 undertake. This limitation extends to the right to organize
 public political meetings. Meetings that do occur are
 limited and without legal foundation. The Communist Party
 obtained authorization to resume its functions last year.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Muslims comprise 99 percent of the population, and Islam is
 the state religion, but the Constitution guarantees freedom
 of worship. This guarantee does not extend to non-Muslim
 proselytizing. Christians and Jews may and do freely
 practice their religions in Tunisia; efforts to convert
 others to their beliefs, however, are considered
 unacceptable. There is no religious discrimination in the
 areas of economics and employment, except that government
 employment is almost entirely reserved for Muslims. Tensions
 which arose in 1982 due to events in Lebanon culminated in
 
 
 1291
 anti-Jewish violence in the towns of Zarzis and Ben
 Guardane. The Government acted decisively to provide police
 protection to the Jewish community and reiterated its
 commitment to interreligious harmony.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Tunisian citizens are free to travel inside the country.
 With few exceptions, they may also travel abroad and return
 without restriction. From time to time, the Government has
 denied passports to regime critics. The process of obtaining
 a passport can still be time-consuming, despite reforms
 instituted by the Government to streamline procedures. Women
 enjoy the same right to travel abroad as men, although
 paternal permission is required for minor children to
 accompany them.
 Approximately 60 documented foreign refugees live in Tunisia,
 most of whom are older and permanently settled. Foreigners
 are not encouraged to choose refuge in Tunisia, but the
 Government cooperates closely with the United Nations High
 Commission for Refugees. Tunisia accepted several hundred
 PLO fighters evacuated from Beirut in the summer of 1982.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Both the executive and legislative branches of the Government
 are empowered to initiate legislation, but the executive
 exercises this responsibility almost exclusively. Party
 matters and political affairs in general continue to be
 dominated by Habib Bourguiba. During 1982, the National
 Assembly served as a forum for lively debate about such
 issues as political amnesty, workers' salaries, and the
 allocation of national resources.
 In negotiations with the Government in 1982, the General
 Union of Tunisian Workers played a central role in shaping
 national wage and pricing policies. Its representatives in
 the National Assembly have been active on economic and union
 issues.
 During the 1981 national legislative elections, political
 opposition groups (with the exception of the jailed Islamic
 fundamentalists) were permitted to compete along with the
 newly-legalized Communist Party, the General Union, and
 ruling Destourian Socialist Party for election to seats in
 the National Assembly. According to the published results of
 the election, the coalition of the ruling party and the
 General Union won all the seats, and no opposition group
 received even five percent of the vote. There were, however,
 election irregularities. Although the opposition is not
 present in the Government or in the National Assembly,
 opposition leaders continue to maintain regular informal
 contacts with senior government officials. High government
 office is generally reserved for members of the ruling
 party. Suffrage is universal. Women, who hold seven of the
 132 National Assembly seats, are encouraged to vote and to
 partipate in the political process. Freedom House, in its
 report for 1982, classified Tunisia as "Partly Free.'
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Tunisian Human Rights League, which maintains chapters in
 a number of cities throughout the country, has access to
 senior levels of government. From time to time, it has
 publicized information about domestic situations which it
 believes merit consideration. Amnesty International, in its
 1982 report covering events in 1981, said its work in Tunisia
 had "focused on efforts to gain the release of more than 40
 
 
 1292
 prisoners of conscience, and appeal for commutation of death
 sentences.' Amnesty also stated its concern "about reports
 of torture and ill-treatment of prisoners.*
 In the past, Amnesty International has sent representatives
 to attend state security trials in Tunisia. The Government
 has not taken a public position with regard to Tunisia-
 related activities of any international human rights
 organization.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Tunisia is a developing country which has made substantial
 progress toward raising real income levels for all segments
 of society and toward improving health conditions and
 ,educational opportunities for the population as a whole. The
 Government gives strong political and material support to
 mass education, family planning, and health improvement
 programs. Adult literacy stands at 62 percent; one third of
 Tunisia's budget goes to education. The infant mortality
 rate is 90 per 1,000 live births, and average life expectancy
 now extends to 60.2 years. Although its population,
 currently over 6,000,000, has been growing at an annual rate
 of 2.5 percent, Tunisia has experienced a rate of economic
 growth almost unparalleled in the developing world. Real
 gross domestic product grew an average of six percent during
 the past five years, although prospects for a continuation of
 that rate in coming years have recently dimmed somewhat. Per
 capita gross national product has risen to over $1,300.
 Despite these gains, Tunisia continues to experience
 difficulty in its effort to even out the significant income
 disparities which exist between urban and rural populations
 and in its efforts to extend the benefits of progress and
 modernization to the more disadvantaged segments of society.
 Improvement of the agricultural sector has traditionally
 lagged behind industrial development, and unemployment
 continues to be a major problem. New policies especially
 designed to tackle these problems were incorporated into the
 1982-1986 development plan.
 The Tunisian Government actively supports legal equality
 between men and women and through legislation has guaranteed
 equal rights in matters of divorce and child custody.
 Inheritance laws, modeled on traditional Koranic practices,
 are more restrictive, especially for non-Muslim women.
 Despite the egalitarian example set by the Government,
 traditional practices sometimes restrict women from full
 enjoyment of their legal rights.
