AFGHANISTAN
2002 was a landmark year for human rights in Afghanistan. For the first time in
over twenty years, Afghans had realistic hopes for stable peace, legitimate governance,
increased development assistance, and new respect for human rights norms.
At the same time however, ongoing security problems in many parts of the country
continued to threaten many Afghans, especially vulnerable populations such as
women and girls, orphans, widows, displaced persons, the disabled, and ethnic
minorities.
The United States-led military campaign against al-Qaeda and the Taliban government
led to the collapse of the Taliban regime in late November 2001. On
December 5, 2001,Afghan representatives in Bonn, Germany, signed an agreement
outlining a power sharing arrangement and the plans for the creation of a new constitution
and democratic government by 2004. A small international peacekeeping
force was created to patrol Kabul, the International Security Assistance Force
(ISAF), headed by the United Kingdom and later Turkey. An interim authority,
headed by Chairman Hamid Karzai, was sworn in on December 22, 2001, and ruled
for six months. In June 2002, an emergency loya jirga (“grand council”) convened
in Kabul under the Bonn Agreement and elected Chairman Karzai as president of
a second transitional government set to lead Afghanistan until 2004, at which time
general elections were to be held. Diplomatic relations between Afghanistan and
most nations were restored, United Nations agencies were reopened, and international
and developmental organizations were granted new access to help Afghanistan
rebuild after years of war and poor governance.
The fall of the Taliban regime allowed numerous military warlords to return to
power, many of them former commanders during the anti-Soviet “jihad” of the
1980s who later became local strongmen during the early 1990s.As the Taliban collapsed,
many of these warlords (who as allies of the U.S.-led coalition had received
significant military and financial support) seized local areas they previously ruled
and took control of the local political and security apparatuses. Some of these warlords
were implicated in alleged war crimes committed this year against Taliban
and al-Qaeda prisoners, reprisals against Pashtun villagers in the north and west of
the country, as well as other human rights violations.Many of these warlords also manipulated the selection of representatives for the loya jirga process during May
and June (or attended themselves) and generally intimidated the populations
under their control throughout the year.
Major commanders in the northeast of the country, many of whom fought with
the late anti-Taliban commander Ahmed Shah Massoud and were members of the
Jamiat-e Islami party wing of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance (or United Front),
managed to secure key ministries in the Kabul-based government, although they
were not necessary firmly allied with President Karzai.Other regional leaders, such
as Gul Agha Sherzai in the south, Ismail Khan in the west, and General Rashid Dostum
in the north,were ostensibly allied with Kabul, but were either independent of
or quietly hostile towards Karzai, fracturing the sense of national unity created by
the Bonn Agreement.Tensions between President Karzai and some of his own ministers—
especially the Jamiat ministers—also raised worries about Karzai’s authority
outside the capital.
Security and protection problems were to be expected in Afghanistan’s postconflict
context; still, in a larger sense, numerous opportunities to improve the
human rights situation in Afghanistan—especially for women—were missed, both
by the Afghan government and the international community. The international
community, and some Afghan leaders, squandered chances to sideline military
commanders, disarm troops, and pressure local leaders to ensure human rights
protections. Generally, not enough attention was paid to making human rights
concerns integral to international and U.S.-led assistance and development efforts.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Human rights conditions generally improved in Afghanistan in 2002, but even
with the Taliban no longer in power, Afghanistan continued to suffer from serious
security problems.Warlords who sprang up in the Taliban’s place committed serious
human rights abuses against civilians and Taliban combatants. In many areas,
women and girls faced the same security problems that existed under the Taliban,
and sometimes the same government-enforced restrictions. Returning refugees
and internally displaced persons faced problems ranging from insecurity to lack of
basic humanitarian assistance. There were also a significant number of civilian
casualties from the U.S. military campaign, some of which may have been the result
of violations of international humanitarian law.
The End of Taliban Restrictions
The end of the Taliban regime was the most notable human rights development
in Afghanistan over the last year.Afghans did not face the widespread governmental
prohibitions on dress, conduct, employment, and religious activities that the
Taliban’s religious police, the Ministry for the Suppression of Vice and the Promotion
ofVirtue (“Vice and Virtue”), had enforced through draconian summary punishments.
Gone also were threats and arbitrary harassment by Taliban troops and
officials, and general insecurity in areas close to conflict lines.Women in most areas were free again to work, attend school and university, and walk in public without
the encompassing burqa (although, as explained below, many chose to continue
wearing them because of their fear of governmental instability and lingering fundamentalism;
in some areas, local government officials forced women to continue
wearing burqas).
Resurgent Warlordism
In many areas of Afghanistan, local commanders and their troops—warlords—
intimidated local populations; extorted money from businesses, farmers, traders,
and ethnic minorities; manipulated elections processes during the loya jirga,
through threats and violence; enforced in some areas Taliban-era restrictions on
female employment and education; and were implicated in possible war crimes
against civilians as well as Taliban and al-Qaeda troops.Commanders in most areas
enjoyed almost complete impunity to harass and intimidate local populations, and
to silence and sideline opponents.
In the last months of 2001 and first months of 2002, there was a wave of attacks
on Pashtun civilians in the north of the country, seemingly because they shared the
same ethnicity as the Taliban leadership. Specifically, troops associated with the
predominately Uzbek party Junbish-i Milli-yi Islami-yi, led by Rashid Dostum, the
predominately Tajik party Jamiat-e Islami, led in the north by Ustad Atta Mohammad,
and the predominately Hazara party Hizb-i Wahdat, led in the north by
Mohammad Mohaqiq, were all implicated in systematic and widespread looting
and violence in almost every province under their separate control, almost all of it
directed at Pashtun villagers. In scores of villages, homes were destroyed, possessions
were taken, and men and boys were beaten and in some cases killed. As discussed
in the women’s rights section below, there were several reports of rapes of
girls and women. In Chimtal district near Mazar-e Sharif, and in Balkh province
generally, both Hizb-i Wahdat and Jamiat forces were particularly violent: in one
village, Bargah-e Afghani, Hizb-i Wahdat troops killed thirty-seven civilians, the
largest known intentional killing of civilians since the fall of the Taliban. In other
villages, Junbish forces conducted thorough looting, in some cases torturing villagers
until they “confessed”as to where their valuables were hidden. East ofMazare
Sharif, in Baghlan and Kunduz provinces, Jamiat forces attacked several Pashtun
areas, severely beating civilians and extorting food, money, and other valuables.
Many Pashtuns fled from these areas, as well as other villages in the north, and went
to Pakistan or congregated in displacement camps in the west and south of the
country. The United Nations also investigated reports in November 2002 that Junbish
forces may have tortured and summarily executed witnesses to alleged killings
of Taliban prisoners in late 2001.
In the west of the country, forces associated with Governor Ismail Khan were
implicated in abuses against Pashtuns and other political opponents. Human
Rights Watch documented that Ismail Khan’s troops were involved in numerous
attacks against civilians in several districts in and around Herat city. In the south of
the country, near Kandahar, several local warlords were accused of extorting money
from local villagers, and troops in and around the city were repeatedly accused of stealing money, cars, motorcycles, and other valuables from civilians, often beating
them in the process.
Lingering Extremist Fundamentalism
In various areas around the country, and in Kabul city itself, there were troubling
signs that some Islamic fundamentalist groups were continuing to exert power,
intimidating and controlling populations, especially in the south and west of the
country. In the south, self-appointed Vice and Virtue police in Zabul province
intimidated women, teachers, journalists, and loya jirga candidates, and burned
down small shops selling video movies, audio cassettes, and movie posters. In western
Herat, governor Ismail Khan ordered a number of announcements on television
and radio about proper Islamic conduct, including instructions for all females
to dress in Islamic clothes (taken to mean the burqa or chadori) and not to associate
with men in public, and for men to refrain from wearing western clothes. Ismail
Khan’s troops began harassing women not dressed in the burqa or chadori—a more
restrictive version of the hijab worn in neighboring Iran.Herat’s police also began
arresting unrelated men and women seen together; in several cases,men were taken
to Herat’s jail and beaten by police troops; women and girls were taken to a hospital,
where police ordered doctors to perform forced medical checks to determine if
the women and girls had had recent sexual intercourse. There were also cases of
youth arrested for drinking alcohol being shaved and paraded around the city, and
made to “confess” publicly on local Herat television.
In Kabul, during the loya jirga, several conservative strongmen intimidated delegates,
suggesting that if they spoke on Islamic issues or the Koran, they would “face
the consequences.” Sima Simar, a member of the first interim government, was
accused of blasphemy, and told to appear in a court to face the charges (later
dropped).Through 2002, there were reports of police forces storming wedding parties,
insisting that playing music was “illegal,” and arresting and sometimes beating
musicians. Reconstituted Vice and Virtue squads patrolled Kabul, intimidating
women without burqas and men wearing Western clothes.
The effects of these instances of enduring fundamentalism was difficult to
gauge,but may have contributed to the general trend among women, even in Kabul,
to resist removing their burqas in public, although many women had not worn the
burqa before the Taliban regime. Resurgent fundamentalism helped sideline Sima
Samar from President Karzai’s cabinet, and affected Karzai’s approach to women’s
rights issues. It has also had a significant impact on the redevelopment of women’s
institutions in areas in the south and west of the country.
Loya Jirga
Under the Bonn Agreement, a special commission of the Interim Authority was
set up in early 2002 to convene a loya jirga—or grand council—in Kabul in June.
The loya jirga was charged with choosing a head of state for a second interim government,
approving proposals for this second government, and appointing its key
ministers.
The selection process for the loya jirga took place throughout May and June.
During the first stage, local authorities were supposed to choose a set of candidates
at the local level, using a “traditional manner” for selecting representatives (in other
words, using traditional local councils known as shuras); during the second stage,
these candidates were to travel to regional centers to vote in a regular ballot to
choose from among themselves a smaller group of final representatives who would
attend the loya jirga in the capital, Kabul. According to the Special Procedures
adopted for the convening of the loya jirga, the first and second stage elections were
to be seen as “free and fair” by regional loya jirga commission observers; otherwise
the commission could void the local elections, and appoint delegates themselves.
All concerned parties agreed that the overall aim of the loya jirga, as articulated by
Security Council resolution 1378, was the creation of a “broad-based,multi-ethnic
and fully representative”Afghan government.The first and second stages of the loya
jirga began in May, and the loya jirga itself took place from June 10-21.
That the loya jirga was even possible, and that it did in fact occur, was an important
political breakthrough for Afghanistan.After twenty-three years of war, many
Afghans were understandably overjoyed that leaders were gathering, and that political
decisions were being made through “exchange of words, rather than exchange
of bullets,” as one delegate put it. To many observers, the possibility of the meeting
ending in deadlock, chaos, or violence was very real, and there was significant relief
that it did not.
Still, there were serious shortcomings with the loya jirga. Despite the promise of
a partially democratic or at least loosely representative political event, the loya jirga
selection process and meeting in June was marred by manipulations and abuses by
Afghan warlords,who interfered with the decision-making of more legitimate representatives.
At the first and second stages of the selection process, Human Rights
Watch documented several cases in which local warlords had imposed themselves
into decision-making and voting processes, directly or indirectly intimidating voters
and delegates through threats and the heavy presence of armed troops.Many of
the delegates selected to the loya jirga were little more than puppets of the local
commanders, and the delegates who were legitimate representatives of Afghan
society were in many cases afraid to speak or vote freely during the loya jirga.
In almost every province in the west of the country, Ismail Khan intimidated,
arrested, or beat loya jirga candidates and their supporters. Pashtun representatives
from several areas accused Ismail Khan of arresting Pashtuns standing for election
to the loya jirga, threatening and beating most of them. Supporters of the former
king of Afghanistan—Zahir Shah—were also intimidated. Just before the loya jirga,
Ismail Khan arrested Rafiq Shahir, a prominent member of the Herat professional
shura, a local civil society group comprised of doctors, teachers, artists, and intellectuals,
holding him for several days, inflicting severe beatings, and threatening
him not to participate. In another province under Ismail Khan’s control, three candidates
were killed during the selection process. Human Rights Watch confirmed
that one of these killings was carried out by commanders loyal to Ismail Khan.
In the south, Human Rights Watch also documented a pattern of intimidation
by local leaders that resulted in several cancelled elections and, in some cases, led to
delegates withdrawing their nominations.
Throughout the country, warlords and regional military commanders were
selected for the loya jirga. General Rashid Dostum, the deputy defense minister in
the interim authority and regional leader of the north of Afghanistan, managed to
have himself elected to the loya jirga despite the fact he was serving as a military
commander and was accused of being complicit in human rights violations; both
factors made him ineligible for the loya jirga under the agreed upon procedures.
Other governors also attended, in violation of the loya jirga procedures, including
the governor of Kandahar,Gul Agha Sherzai, the governor of Nangahar,Haji Abdul
Qadir, and Ismail Khan. Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan,
and Lakhdar Brahimi, the special representative of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, pressured the Afghan loya jirga commission to allow regional governors
and military commanders to attend.
Many delegates and participants in the loya jirga process were so afraid of local
warlords that they refused to speak openly with researchers from Human Rights
Watch. U.N. observers confirmed that a climate of fear was pervasive throughout
the elections.
At the loya jirga itself, Human Rights Watch documented more problems,
including a widespread and systematic pattern of intimidation and threats by warlords
and regional leaders; covert and overt surveillance by intelligence agents allied
with certain parties; and a general failure by the loya jirga commission, relevant
U.N. officials, and other international actors to enforce provisions in the Bonn
Agreement and the loya jirga procedures that were meant to sideline Afghan military
leaders and Afghans with records of serious human rights abuses. Numerous
loya jirga delegates complained to Human Rights Watch that they received explicit
threats from warlords warning them not to vote in certain ways or interfere with the
backdoor political dealing going on between them.Some delegates were threatened
several times. One delegate was threatened for giving a speech about women’s
rights in the Koran. The husband of the only female candidate for president was
threatened by intelligence agents allied with the Jamiat party. There were many
instances of intelligence agents making threats to delegates who wished to speak in
debate, and many instances of agents taking photographs and writing the names of
delegates who spoke openly about their frustrations with the process.
In addition, a general sense of chaos and poor management marred the loya jirga
throughout its proceedings. The voting for Hamid Karzai’s presidency proceeded
by secret ballot and was largely uncontroversial (although some delegates were disappointed
by the seemingly U.S.-imposed arrangement to have the former Afghan
king, Zahir Shah, withdraw as a candidate). Later votes taken on the arrangement
of the transitional government and its key personnel, however, were highly irregular:
there was no debate or proper vote on the composition of the next transitional
government (instead, Karzai nominated a cabinet which was approved by a vague
“voice” vote) and the loya jirga never approved any plan or proposal for the design
of the government.The loya jirga chairman,Mohammad Ismail Qasimyar, failed to
exercise effective control over the proceedings, and the United Nations failed to
assist the loya jirga commission in preparing for a more orderly meeting.Warlords
were handily able to manipulate the process, and as a result, most legitimate participants
were thoroughly disillusioned with it.
At the close of the loya jirga, President Karzai invited delegates who had been
threatened to report abuses to his office directly, but at the time of this writing, no
clear action had been taken to hold abusers accountable.
Continuing Insecurity
Although some of the worst violence during 2002 took place in the first few
months of the year, insecurity plagued most of the country throughout the year.
Local armed conflict continued in several areas of Afghanistan. Fighting between
rival commanders occurred in the provinces of Balkh, Jowzjan, Samangan, Sar-e
Pol, Bamiyan, Paktia, Paktika, Khost, Uruzgon, Hilmand, Farah, and Herat. As
described below, incidents of violence retarded refugee return programs, and led to
some displacement—especially from the north. Hundreds of civilians around the
country were killed and injured in the ongoing violence.
On February 14, 2002,Minister of Civil Aviation and Tourism Abdul Rahman
was killed during a riot at the Kabul airport.Vice President Haji Abdul Qadir, a former
mujahidin military commander from Jalalabad, was assassinated by gunmen
in Kabul on July 6, 2002.
Security deteriorated further in late 2002.There was an assassination attempt on
President Karzai in early September in Kandahar, on the same day a large bomb was
detonated in Kabul, killing approximately twenty-six people. A few days later, over
ten civilians were killed in fighting in Khost, during fighting that began after a
bomb was detonated in the capital of that province. A month later, several civilians
were killed during a conflict near the Shindand airbase in the west. Scores of civilians
were also killed in violence in October and November in central and northern
provinces.
Throughout the year, humanitarian aid workers were attacked or shot at near
Mazar-e Sharif,Herat, and Kandahar cities.Travelers between major cities reported
that extortion, robbery, and harassment—almost all by armed troops—regularly
occurred on most roads. Trucks and buses were “taxed” repeatedly at military
checkpoints; local minorities often were forced to pay more than others. People
who challenged the troops risked being pulled from cars, beaten, and arrested.
Women and Girls’ Rights
Many women and girls in Afghanistan benefited from immediate relaxations of
Taliban-era prohibitions, and some women even secured some important governmental
posts at the local and national level. However, because of lingering insecurity
and recurring threats by fundamentalist groups, many female Afghans
continued to fear for their security, and, as noted above, continued to wear the
body-encompassing burqa, which Taliban police had forced women to wear under
threat of imprisonment and beatings.Although many women and girls returned to
workplaces and schools, millions remained marginalized in Afghanistan because of
continuing discrimination and harassment by governmental and non-governmental
actors, unable to secure their livelihoods, educations, or basic human rights.The
situation was especially bad in the west and south.
As detailed above, after the fall of the Taliban, the north of Afghanistan was
gripped by acute general lawlessness and insecurity, factional rivalry between Junbish,
Jamiat, and Hizb-i Wahdat troops, and retaliatory violence against Pashtun
civilians. As part of the general violence against Pashtuns, the forces noted above
perpetrated sexual violence against Pashtun women and girls, in some cases, gangraping
all the female members of a family, including girls as young as fourteen.
Women and girls of other ethnicities also experienced sexual violence in Mazare
Sharif, in northern Afghanistan. Although in May and June 2002 attacks against
ethnic Pashtuns decreased, some women living in camps near Mazar-e Sharif for
internally displaced persons (IDPs) faced increased sexual abuse, especially after
the camp was militarized by Jamiat forces.
Afghan women and girls in many areas also continued to face threats and violence
for not adhering to former Taliban edicts that had previously strictly controlled
their behavior, dress, expression, and movement.After schools reopened in
March 2002, women and girls in Zabul and Kandahar provinces in southern
Afghanistan felt unsafe walking to school because of the continued presence of
gunmen and soldiers allegedly aligned with the Taliban, some of whom would
threaten or attack them.In October, fundamentalists destroyed several girls schools
in the center and east of the country—either burning or rocketing the schools when
classes were not in session. In the west of the country, women were instructed not
to work or ride in cars with foreign men; some Afghan women working with international
agencies in Herat were harassed and intimidated, told to lower their
burqas, and not to show their face. Through October and November, the situation
for women’s rights in the city ofHerat deteriorated further: several women and girls
in Herat observed walking or driving with unrelated men were arrested and taken
to hospitals, where troops ordered doctors to perform forced gynecological checkups
to determine whether they had had recent sexual intercourse.
These threats and acts of violence denied women and girls the opportunity to
participate effectively at all levels in public life at a critical moment in the history of
Afghanistan.As the loya jirga got underway in June,many women felt compelled to
restrict their participation.The ongoing abuses were especially disappointing given
the context. Historically, loya jirgas have been largely unrepresentative of women,
since most delegates are chosen from male-dominated shuras. But at the June
assembly, 160 women were guaranteed seats out of 1,500 designated seats, and
women also had the option of being elected to non-reserved seats. One hundred
and eighty women delegates were actually present at the loya jirga, a significant step
forward for women’s political representation. However, a number of the women
delegates, such as some of the twenty-eight women from southern Afghanistan,
faced threats against participating in the elections. The husband of a candidate in
the south was told to make his wife withdraw, or they would be killed. As noted
above, Sima Samar, the former women’s minister, faced threats during and after the
loya jirga from men aligned with the Jamiat faction and officials in government.
Many other women were threatened not to “make trouble.”
Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons
At the beginning of 2002, Afghanistan continued to have one of the largest displaced
populations in the world:well over four million refugees were displaced outside
their country, mostly living in Iran and Pakistan, and over one million were
displaced within Afghanistan. As a result of the Taliban’s demise, the end of civil
conflict in many areas, good security conditions in major urban areas, and expectations
of better economic prospects attached to the increased international
involvement, hundreds of thousands of refugees returned in late 2001 and early
2002, mostly from Pakistan, but also from Iran, Europe, and the United States.
On March 1, 2002, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) and Afghan authorities started a facilitated return program for refugees
from Pakistan, and on April 3, UNHCR and the governments of Iran and Afghanistan
signed a tripartite agreement for the voluntary repatriation of Afghan
refugees from Iran. Returning refugees from both countries were provided with
transportation and an assistance package from UNHCR and the World Food Program
(WFP), including a small cash grant to cover transport costs on arrival in
Afghanistan, and basic food and non-food items. UNHCR and the International
Organization for Migration (IOM) also provided transport and basic assistance to
internally displaced persons wishing to return to their homes. UNHCR estimated
in mid-November 2002 that 1.7 million refugees had returned to Afghanistan in
2002, although it acknowledged that many returnees, especially from Pakistan,
were abusing repatriation programs: returning to Afghanistan, receiving assistance,
and then leaving once again.
At the same time, there were credible reports from Iran and Pakistan of forced
returns and deportations as well as “push factors” such as police harassment and
restrictions on employment rights and health and education services.
Refugees were returning to a country ravaged by decades of civil war and conflict,
destruction from the U.S. bombing campaign, insecure conditions in some
parts of the country, and the continuation of devastating drought in the south.
Basic infrastructure and services were essentially non-existent outside urban areas.
The homes and property of many refugees and displaced persons were destroyed,
and many returnees had absolutely no resources with which to resume rural life.
Most returnees faced a grim reality in their former towns and villages—no shelter,
food, roads, schools, health clinics, effective security, law enforcement, or employment
opportunities.As a result, although well over one million Afghan refugees in
Iran and Pakistan decided to return to Afghanistan in 2002,many did not return to
their original homes, or the homes of family members, but instead chose to reside
in urban areas such as Kabul, Jalalabad, and Mazar-e Sharif.Many more remained
in Pakistan and Iran, reluctant to return to areas in Afghanistan still suffering from
insecurity or severe drought. Many refugees continued to fear persecution at the
hands of local commanders in several areas of Afghanistan, such as former government
officials, journalists, political opponents, and critics of the current authorities.
Many residents of Mazar-e Sharif and Herat had to flee to Kabul or abroad to
escape political persecution. On August 6, 2002 UNHCR estimated that some eight
hundred thousand Afghans continued to be internally displaced in Afghanistan.As of mid-November,well over one million refugees remain in Pakistan and well over
one million remain in Iran.
The United Nations and Afghan government had not anticipated returns on this
scale.The Afghan authorities,UNHCR,other U.N. and humanitarian agencies,and
donors were seriously ill-equipped to cope with the scale and speed of the repatriation.
Agencies’ budgets were overstretched, which prevented UNHCR and others
from offering adequate assistance.Monitoring of returnee sustainability and security
was slow to start, and was insufficient in many areas.
There were also budgetary shortfalls for U.N. agencies whose work impacted
repatriation programming.When the fifteen-nation Afghanistan Support Group
met in Geneva in July 2002, the chair noted a budgetary shortfall of U.S.$777 million
for reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts in Afghanistan; at the same meeting
UNHCR announced that 25 percent of its budget had not been met and it still
required U.S.$70 million for the remainder of the year. These shortfalls in reconstruction
and development funds exacerbated the “overstretch” problems. At the
end ofMay 2002, the IOM announced that it was forced to suspend temporarily its
internal transport network for returning refugees from Iran and internally displaced
persons due to lack of funding (it was able to resume limited transport for
returning internally displaced persons in June). The World Food Program, which
supplies food to returning refugees in many areas, also warned that it would face
food shortages by November if donors did not step up to the mark. Development
programs—which could have a significant impact on returnee trends—were
stalled for most of the year.
Apart from the lack of funding and unmet humanitarian needs, returnees also
faced serious ongoing security problems throughout Afghanistan.As documented
earlier in this chapter, there were continuing hostilities between warlords in the
north and west of the country which made it impossible for humanitarian agencies
to operate in certain locations; there were also many areas in which lawlessness and
abuses by warlords’ forces made it impossible for refugees to return to their homes.
In addition, in some areas in the north and west of the country, fighting, political
oppression, and ethnically-based abuses were in fact still causing displacement:
according to UNHCR, roughly fifteen thousand Pashtun Afghans fled areas in the
west because of harassment by forces associated with Ismail Khan;more than thirty
thousand Pashtuns fled the north of the country because of abuses by forces there.
The threat of continued fighting, criminality, and political instability slowed
repatriation in many areas—especially areas outside of Kabul. General insecurity
repeatedly led to the temporary suspension of return programs. On July 2,UNHCR
announced that it was suspending returns of internally displaced persons from the
western province of Herat to Faryab and Samangan provinces and to parts of Balkh
province in northern Afghanistan, because of the escalating violence and worsening
human rights situation in northern and central Afghanistan. The gang-rape of
an international aid worker close to Mazar-e Sharif in early June and a series of
other attacks on aid agencies in the north around the same time prompted humanitarian
relief organizations to call for an extension of the ISAF and caused some to
threaten to withdraw altogether if security conditions did not improve. In September
of 2002, UNHCR suspended some operations in the west of the country, after a shooting incident at the Iran-Afghan border in which a UNHCR staff person was
almost hit.Refugees themselves hesitated to repatriate to several areas; for instance,
near Khost and in some places in Bamiyan, there were almost no refugee returns in
2002.
Landmines
On September 11, 2002, President Hamid Karzai deposited Afghanistan’s
instruments of accession to the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty with the United Nations,
making the country the 126th state party to this historic agreement. The accession
followed a pledge made during the first international mine action conference to
take place in Kabul in late July 2002:“Building a Peaceful Future for Afghanistan:A
Total Ban on Anti-Personnel Mines.” The move was likely to boost funding and
other international support for mine action programs in this heavily mine-affected
country.
Demining operations were virtually brought to a halt following September 11,
2001. The mine action infrastructure suffered greatly during the subsequent military
conflict, as some warring factions looted offices, seized vehicles and equipment,
and assaulted local staff. Approximately 80 percent of the demining
equipment for the southern region of Afghanistan was destroyed during October
and November 2001, mostly in a U.S. air strike on a U.N. compound near Kandahar
which was occupied temporarily by Taliban troops. Four deminers and two
mine detection dogs were also killed in errant U.S. air strikes in Kabul. Military
operations created additional threats to the population, especially unexploded U.S.
cluster bomblets, ammunition scattered from storage depots hit by air strikes, and
mines and booby-traps newly laid by Northern Alliance, Taliban, and al-Qaeda
fighters.
A funding shortfall for the mine action program in Afghanistan prior to September
11, 2001 had threatened to curtail mine action operations. After October
2001, about U.S.$64 million was pledged for mine action in Afghanistan. By March
2002, mine clearance, mine survey, and mine risk education operations had
returned to earlier levels, and subsequently expanded beyond 2001 levels.
The United States-Led Air War and Conduct of Taliban,
Northern Alliance, and Coalition Forces
U.S.-led Operation Enduring Freedom began in Afghanistan on October 7,
2001. The initial phases of the military offensive, through roughly January 2002,
largely consisted of two activities. The first was U.S. and British airstrikes against
fixed tactical and strategic targets throughout Afghanistan. The second involved
cooperation between Afghan opposition military forces and U.S. Special Operations
troops to identify emerging tactical and leadership targets for attack by U.S.
strike aircraft and heavy bombers.
Human Rights Watch sent a team to Afghanistan in March 2002 to investigate
allegations of civilian casualties during Operation Enduring Freedom. The United
States generally took significant precautions before attacking fixed strategic targets in both urban and rural areas. The use of precision-guided munitions in such
attacks was widespread and generally confined damage to intended targets.
However, the bombing caused significant numbers of civilian casualties due to
technical failures, human error (including misidentification of targets), and in
some cases, weapons selection and targeting decisions that were inconsistent with
international humanitarian law.
The use of cluster bombs by U.S. forces also caused civilian harm.Cluster bomb
strikes in populated areas, including two incidents near Herat, killed at least
twenty-five civilians and injured many more. Long after the initial attacks, unexploded
cluster bomblets littered villages and farmland, waiting to be cleared. They
became de facto landmines that caused scores of additional civilian casualties.
The Taliban and al-Qaeda bore major responsibility for civilian harm during the
air war. In particular, there was evidence that Taliban and al-Qaeda forces in some
cases used the civilian population to shield themselves from attack, a practice prohibited
by international humanitarian law.
As discussed in,Human Rights Watch World Report 2002, there were serious allegations
about the conduct of anti-Taliban forces in late 2001, including that forces
in the northeast and south summarily executed Taliban prisoners of war. In 2002,
there were several reports that Rashid Dostum’s troops had killed hundreds of Taliban
prisoners while transporting them in sealed containers from Kunduz towards
Mazar-e Sharif. The bodies were said to have been buried in mass graves in Balkh
province.There were also allegations that forces throughout Afghanistan summarily
executed Pashtuns and other minorities perceived to be associated with the Taliban.
These and other alleged crimes committed by anti-Taliban forces had not yet
been investigated by the United Nations at this writing.
U.S. and coalition military operations continued in eastern and southern
Afghanistan through the autumn of 2002 and were ongoing as of this writing.
There were sporadic incidents of civilian casualties in this period, including an
attack by an AC-130 gunship in Oruzgan Province on June 30, 2002, in which at
least thirty-five Afghan civilians were killed. The continued detention of Afghan
and al-Qaeda forces on U.S. military bases also raised serious issues of international
humanitarian law. (See United States.)
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
The Bonn Agreement of 2001 mandated the creation of an Afghan human rights
commission, tasked with promoting human rights norms and investigating human
rights violations. (As noted below, the United Nations was also given an affirmative
right under the agreement to conduct human rights investigations.) The commission
remained in dire need of international support throughout the year, and at this
writing continued to be without basic resources such as cars, phones, and adequate
office space. The head of the commission, Sima Samar, although weakened by
attacks on her reputation, submitted a budget and plan for 2003 that included
investigations of abuses, a country-wide consultation process on accountability for
past abuses, and human rights education projects.
Several human rights and civil society groups—some of which had already been
operating in exile before the Taliban’s fall—opened offices in Afghanistan in 2002.
Most were severely underfunded,without adequate resources to operate effectively,
but the appearance of new groups itself was a welcome sign in a nation in which
human rights groups had long been suppressed.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) expanded its
operations throughout 2002, increasing staff and offices in almost every region in
Afghanistan.For the first time in years, the U.N. mission to Afghanistan had human
rights monitoring and protection staff working within Afghanistan. The 2001
Bonn Agreement expressly gave the U.N.“the right to investigate human rights violations
and, where necessary, recommend corrective action.” (Annex II.) UNAMA
human rights officials investigated human rights abuses in various parts of the
country and maintained human rights monitoring staff in several areas. The U.N.
also played a big role in organizing and monitoring the loya jirga, and in the protection
of delegates and other political representatives who faced threats following
its conclusion. U.N. civil and political affairs officers, and Lakhdar Brahimi, the
special representative of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, continued to play a
major role in negotiating agreements between rival groups in Afghanistan and
maintaining stability.
Several U.N. human rights officials began preliminary investigations in Afghanistan.
The U.N. special rapporteur on Afghanistan, Kamal Hossein, traveled to
Afghanistan. The special representative of the secretary-general on children in
armed conflict and the special rapporteur on summary and extrajudicial executions
visited Afghanistan in the course of the year. U.N. High Commissioner for
Human Rights Mary Robinson traveled in Afghanistan extensively in March, and
reported her findings and conclusions.
UNAMA’s work on human rights suffered from serious weaknesses. The mission’s
“light footprint” approach—meant to lower the number of international
staff and increase Afghan participation in U.N. efforts—was not effective in
addressing human rights violations. Human rights components of the mission
were understaffed and given low priority by UNAMA leadership. No efforts were
made to place a heavy monitoring presence on the ground, patrol areas of concern,
or robustly investigate alleged war crimes.
UNAMA staff did work diligently with what resources they had to monitor
human rights conditions. They succeeded in containing some of the effects of
intimidation and abuses during the loya jirga, although they were ultimately unable
to stop local military commanders from manipulating the election process.
UNAMA staff also mediated several disputes between commanders, and in a number
of cases stopped or prevented local armed conflicts from erupting.
Still, by the end of the year, only one international human rights monitor was posted in each of Afghanistan’s eight regions, supported by two local staff. Because
the Afghan Human Rights Commission was weak and poorly organized,UNAMA
was unable to rely on its work to supplement the UNAMA mandate. The U.N. was
able to gather useful information on human rights conditions in many areas, and
intervened in important cases to protect vulnerable persons, but on the whole the
mission was reactive, and did not effectively process information gathered by staff.
The UNAMA office often did not publicize information and findings about local
human rights situations in the country.Many UNAMA staff expressed frustration
with the seemingly low priority put on human rights in the mission.
United States, Iran, Pakistan, U.S. Coalition Partners,
and ISAF Contributors
The United States was heavily involved in political settlements, negotiations,
and assistance to Afghanistan in 2002, but did not pursue a coherent or long-term
security strategy.Neither did Afghanistan’s neighbors, Pakistan and Iran. The official
policy of these countries during 2002 was to work with President Hamid Karzai
to help him strengthen his government and rebuild the country. Yet the U.S., Iran,
and Pakistan all actively supported local warlords in various regions of the country.
During the U.S.-led attack in Afghanistan in 2001, the United States,United Kingdom,
and other coalition partners supplied warlords with cash,weapons, uniforms,
and satellite telephones.
These policies were contradictory, and worked to destabilize the country. Local
warlords with records of human rights abuses, for instance Ismail Khan,Muhammad
Karim Khalili, and Rashid Dostum, all strengthened their grip on local power
outside of Kabul. Few meaningful steps were taken by the United States, Iran, or
Pakistan to counteract or blunt the effects of this strategy,nor by countries involved
in the U.S.-led coalition or in peacekeeping operations (ISAF), including Turkey,
Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, and Australia.Most nations acted as if police
training and the rebuilding of the Afghan Army in Kabul would be sufficient solutions
to Afghanistan’s security problems, despite the fact that these programs were
poorly administered, did not have much effect beyond Kabul, and were considered
to have little effect in the short- or medium-term.
International actors in Afghanistan resisted widespread calls to expand the ISAF
peacekeeping force beyond Kabul. Instead, security outside Kabul was put in the
hands of the local military forces that the U.S.-led coalition supported during the
war against the Taliban. As detailed above, many of these same forces committed
abuses against civilians. U.S. and coalition forces in some areas acted as de facto
monitors, and helped create a modicum of protection, but in many areas of the
country warlords continued to commit abuses against the population. President
Karzai and various Afghan leaders continued to call on the U.S. and its partners in
Afghanistan to expand ISAF.
On November 12, 2002, the United States Congress unanimously passed the
Afghanistan Freedom Support Act, which authorizes increased funding for reconstruction
programming, urges the president to act to expand peacekeeping forces outside of Kabul, and requires the president to deliver a report to Congress every
six months describing, among other things, what the administration has done to
improve security, human rights protections, and rule of law.
