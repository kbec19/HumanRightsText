PARAGUAY
The report on Paraguay is a thorough and accurate account of the human rights situation in that country. The report covers the major areas of human rights concerns, including the increasing nimiber of arbitrary arrests and detentions of political activists, often accompanied by beatings; "the well-publicized and credible charges of torture and physical abuse by police and municipal officials in criminal cases"; the often unremedied killings at police hands; the arrest and torture of landless peasants; the ongoing restrictions on freedom of the press, such as the continued banning of the opposition newspaper ABC Color and the jamming of Radio Nanduti until it was forced to suspend broadcasts in January 1987; the violent suppression of political and labor opposition activities; and the complete domination of all government and political activities by General Stroessner and his supporters in the Colorado Party. The report notes that in April 1987 the state of siege lapsed for the first extended period of time in sbcty years, with a corresponding reduction of abuses, but it then properly tempers this observation by noting that repression greatly increased later in the year.
As in previous years, the thoroughness of the report reflects the persistence of Ambassador Clyde Taylor in monitoring and promoting human rights in Paraguay. These efforts continued despite attacks on him by the Paraguayan government after the January 1987 suspension of U.S. trade benefits to Paraguay for its failure to respect internationally recognized worker rights. The poor state of human rights in Paraguay underscores the importance of Ambassador Taylor's efforts.
