 SENEGAL
 Senegal is a Republic with a democratically elected President
 and a unicameral Parliament. After acceding automatically to
 the presidency in January 1981, when former President Leopold
 Senghor retired, Abdou Diouf was elected in his own right in
 freely contested elections in February 1983. A new Parliament
 was elected at the same time with President Diouf's Socialist
 Party winning ill of the 120 seats. Senegal has longstanding
 democratic traditions which predate independence, and there is
 wide public interest in, and debate on, political matters.
 While the Socialist Party has dominated the political scene
 since independence from France in 1960, Senegal is a true
 multiparty state and has 16 legal political parties.
 The Senegalese military has a reputation as an apolitical and
 professional organization, respected by the population. The
 civilian security forces are generally well-trained and
 disciplined and respect the laws they enforce.
 Although the Senegalese Government describes the nation's
 economy as Socialist--and the Socialist Party is a member of
 the Socialist International--the private sector is important
 and growing. Economic concerns grew again in 1985 as the
 Government began to implement a series of policies--raising
 prices while keeping wages down--aimed at reducing deficits
 and subsidies.
 Long and short-term trends in the human rights context remain
 positive. The legal system is active and effective in
 protecting human rights. Concerns about the fairness of the
 political system are regularly raised by opposition party
 leaders, but on the whole the system works well. The growth
 of Islamic fundamentalism and the increase in the crime rate
 due to economic pressures remain worrisome because of their
 potential impact on human rights. There were no credible
 reports of major human rights violations in 1985, but an
 editor of an opposition newspaper was arrested on charges of
 defamation of the President. The Government continues to
 support the work of Dakar-based human rights organizations in
 Africa.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Political Killing
 There is no evidence of any killings at government instigation
 or for political motives.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of abduction of individuals by
 official, quasi-official, opposition, or vigilante groups.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Government officials in Senegal generally respect the
 constitutional theme that the person is sacred and they adhere
 to the section of the criminal code prohibiting physical
 abuse. There have been, however, instances reported of the
 
 
 264
 SENEGAL
 use-of force by lower level police officials in the
 -interrogation-of. suspected criminals. In its, 1985 report,
 Amnesty International noted that it had received information
 suggesting a number of those arrested in late 1983, following
 the.easamance.separatist riots, had been subjected to torture,
 including severe beatings..and electrical shocks. Prison
 conditions are crowded and food is little above the
 subsistence level. Harsh prison conditions are to some extent
 �alleviated by the access to prisoners by clerics, friends, and
 families, who.are permitted to provide food and amenities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 �The-constitutional prohibition, against arbitrary arrest or
 detention is respected in practice. Persons are not detained,
 .punished,-or tried for-the expression of views critical of or
 .different from those of the Government. However, preventive
 detention is-permitted-when civil authorities determine that
 ;there is a threat of civil,.disturbance or the person is a
 danger to himself or others. .-Amnesty International in its
 1985 report expressed concern about the prolonged pretrial
 detention of people arrested in connection with the autonomist
 movement in Casamance. The Senegalese legal system is
 patterned after the French system and does not include habeas
 corpus. A person suspected of a crime may be legally held
 without charge for 48 hours after arrest or up to 72 hours if
 ordered by a public prosecutor. The.limitations of this
 provision of law are in almost all cases respected, and
 charges are formally and clearly drawn.- By law, every citizen
 has access to legal counsel of his choice in every aspect of
 legal procedure: in practice, persons with means will have
 .private legal counsel,and the law makes provisions for public
 defenders for those without funds.  There is no forced or
 compulsory labor in Senegal.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Senegal has an active, independent, and well-trained
 judiciary, which is constitutionally independent of the
 executive, the legislature, and the military. Court officials
 are trained lawyers who have completed a number of years of
 required apprenticeship. Trials are open to the public, and
 defendants have the right to a defense counsel, many of whom
 are very skilled and aggressive in the protection of their
 clients. Ordinary courts hold hearings which are presided
 over by a panel of judges and, in the case of criminal
 charges, include a jury. There are three categories of
 courts: the High Court of Justice, the security ("political")
 court, and the military courts.
 The High Court of Justice was created for the sole purpose of
 trying high government officials for treason or malfeasance.
 This Court has not been convened since the early 1970's. The
 security (or "political") court consists of a judge and two
 assessors. It has jurisdiction over cases referred to it by
 the Government when it is suspected that a crime has been
 committed for a political motive. The security court has not
 been active since 1984 when it met to hear cases arising out
 of a series of separatist riots in the Casamance region.
 The military court system has jurisdiction over offenses
 committed by members of the armed forces during peacetime (in
 wartime, courts martial could be convened). Civilians may not
 be tried by military courts.
 
 
 SENEGAL
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Senegalese bureaucracy, patterned after the French system,
 is highly centralized and requires of Senegalese citizens a
 fairly extensive array of documentation for purposes of
 education, obtaining social security benefits, etc. The
 intent, however, is not coercive and there is otherwise little
 government interference in the private lives of Senegalese
 citizens. There is no coercion to join a particular political
 party or to participate in political demonstrations. A wide
 variety of political expression is possible and is not subject
 to restrictions other than those relating to public order.
 There is no evident pattern of monitoring the private written
 or oral correspondence of Senegalese citizens. Foreign
 publications are not banned or censored. There are inviolable
 constitutional and legal safeguards against arbitrary invasion
 of the home. Search warrants are required and may be issued
 only by judges and in accordance with procedures established
 by law. There is no evidence that public security forces have
 violated the law in this regard.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Senegal enjoys freedom of speech and press in theory and in
 practice. The Constitution guarantees the right of each
 person to express and disseminate opinions freely. There are
 several regularly published newspapers and magazines and a
 number of publications which appear sporadically, reflecting a
 broad range of opinion from conservative to Marxist. The
 country's most professional and informative newspaper is
 controlled by, and supports, the majority Socialist Party.
 However, articles critical of government policies and
 officials regularly appear even in this newspaper.
 In August 1985, the editor of an opposition publication was
 arrested and charged with defamation of the chief of state and
 the Government after his magazine published an article
 accusing members of the President's family and entourage of
 corruption. Opposition leaders described this as an attempt
 to muzzle the media. Other publications, representing other
 viewpoints, are sometimes vociferously critical of the
 Government.
 Academic freedom is enjoyed without hindrance by the schools
 and the country's sole university. Television and radio
 stations are owned by the Government, but coverage is
 regularly given to the activities of all political parties.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Senegalese freely and frequently exercise their constitutional
 right of assembly. Prior authorization for public
 demonstration is required. Demonstrations or protest meetings
 against government policies are closely monitored by the
 security services. In August 1985, the Government refused
 permission for a protest march organized by the opposition
 parties, not because it objected to the march (which was to
 criticize apartheid), but because the Government believed the
 timing and route of the planned demonstration were calculated
 to cause the maximum disruption to normal business and traffic
 in downtown Dakar. When a few opposition supporters assembled
 
 
 266
 SENEGAL
 at the scheduled time and place, police quickly moved in,
 dispersed the group, and arrested several opposition leaders,
 including two National Assembly deputies. They were charged
 with holding an unauthorized demonstration. When the case
 came to trial, the magistrate dismissed it, saying that the
 police had moved so quickly that no demonstration had ever
 started. In October, the Government again refused
 authorization for a demonstration by the same group of
 .opposition parties, because it allegedly posed a threat to
 public safety.
 Workers have the right of association and the right to
 organize and bargain collectively and strike if negotiations
 are unsuccessful. The major trade union confederation, the
 National Confederation of Senegalese Workers (CNTS), is
 affiliated with the ruling Socialist Party. There are also
 small independent trade unions which are important to the
 society and economy of Senegal. Less than 25 percent of the
 labor force is unionized. The CNTS is entitled by law to
 ministerial posts, but rather than fill them itself has chosen
 to retain the right to veto the President's nominations. In
 the past, the Government has used its connection with the
 Confederation as a useful means of informing workers of
 government policies, gaining better understanding of worker
 grievances, and ensuring that strikes are legal and called
 only over significant grievances. A wildcat strike by a
 nonaffiliated union of transport drivers reduced traffic in
 Dakar considerably for a few days during September. The
 leader of the union was sentenced to a year in jail for
 leading the strike. In that instance, as in most union
 activities in Senegal, economic and work-related issues are
 the principal concerns. The International Labor Organization
 maintains a regional office in Senegal.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Senegal is constitutionally a secular state, and freedom of
 religion is a legal right which exists in fact. Islam is the
 religion of over 85 percent of the population. Other
 religions, primarily Catholicism, are freely practiced.
 Missionary activity is permitted, and foreign Protestant
 missionaries are active in several regions of the country.
 Conversion is permitted; there is no discrimination against
 minority religions; and adherence to a particular religion
 confers neither advantage nor disadvantage in civil,
 political, economic, military, or other sectors.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Senegalese Constitution states that all citizens have the
 right to move and establish themselves freely anywhere in
 Senegal, a right that is respected in practice. In 1981, the
 Government abolished a requirement for exit visas to travel
 outside the country. There is no restriction on emigration,
 nor are there sanctions, official or otherwise, against
 intending emigrants. Repatriates are not officially
 disadvantaged on return to Senegal.
 Senegal is host to 5,140 recognized and assisted refugees.
 Prior to the April 3, 1984 coup in Guinea, there were an
 estimated 500,000-600,000 Guineans in Senegal most of whom
 were not recognized as refugees. Most appear to have returned
 to Guinea. There is a regional office of the United Nations
 
 
 267
 SENEGAL
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) office in Dakar.
 Senegal continues to make places available for refugee
 students from other countries at the University of Dakar and
 other educational institutions.  There are no known cases of
 forcible repatriation by the Senegalese Government.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Senegal is a functioning multiparty democracy. There are
 currently 16 legally registered parties, ranging from
 conservative to Trotskyite. Presidential and parliamentary
 elections were last held in February 1983, with rural and
 municipal elections in November 1984. While there has been a
 long tradition of democracy in Senegal, political life
 throughout the post-independence period has been dominated by
 the Socialist Party, which won the presidency and i11 of the
 120 seats in the National Assembly in the 1983 elections.
 There were some complaints at that time, and again during
 rural and municipal elections, that voting irregularities had
 favored the Socialist Party. While the consensus was that the
 voting was on the whole free and fair, the largest opposition
 party, with eight seats in the assembly, maintains that the
 lack of stricter controls on vote identification and voting
 sites made some of the results questionable.
 Senegal has universal suffrage. Women are active participants
 in the political process, and several parties, including the
 dominant Socialist Party, have sections promoting women's
 rights. Twelve women are deputies in the National Assembly
 and there are four women in President Diouf's cabinet. In
 addition, a number of government ministries employ women in
 key positions, i.e., the Political Director in the Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs. In other ministries key agronomists,
 statisticians, and economists are women.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Senegal is a leader among African countries in the
 establishment and promotion of international standards for
 human rights practices. Senegal was the original sponsor of
 the Human Rights Charter of the Organization of African Unity,
 and is also an active member of the Human Rights Commission.
 Dakar is the headquarters of the African Bar Association's
 Institute of Human Rights, an organization which trains
 lawyers and judges in translating general human rights
 principles into practical legal and judicial procedures. A
 number of Senegalese are prominent in African and
 international human rights activities. Senegal maintains a
 dialogue with organizations such as Amnesty International,
 which was noted in Amnesty International's 1985 report (see
 also sections ic and ld above). Freedom House rates Senegal
 'partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Senegal, whose population of 6.8 million is growing at the
 high rate of 3.3 percent each year, has suffered significant
 economic reverses during the past few years. The quality of
 life has been affected by poor performance in the agricultural
 sector, which provides a livelihood for about 70 percent of
 
 
 268
 SENEGAL
 Senegal's population. Per capita GNP reached $486 in 1982,
 but dropped to $440 in 1983.
 The decline in the local currency's value against the dollar
 during the past three years has directlyaffected the economy,
 despite only modest trade linkages with the United States.
 Approximately 40 percent of Senegal's foreign debt and all of
 its oil and gas purchases are denominated in dollars.
 Payments on external debt and the energy import bill consumed
 almost all foreign currency and earnings accumulated in recent
 years. On the positive side, the rains were exceptionally
 good in 1985, the best since 1973; thus ending 2 years of
 drought which had severely reduced yields of groundnuts
 (peanuts), Senegal's traditional major cash crop and foreign
 exchange earner.
 Health conditions have improved over the past decade. Senegal
 provided 97 percent of caloric requirements per capita in
 1977, and probably held this level in 1985, despite two years
 of drought, in part through a continuing influx of foreign
 food and assistance. Nearly half of Senegal's population now
 has access tosafe water. The number of physicians and
 nursing personnel per 100,000 population has doubled since
 1960. Infant mortality has declined from 150 per 1,000 live
 births in 1972 to 101.6 in 1985. Life expectancy at birth has
 risen from an estimated 40 years in 1969 to nearly 47 years in
 1985. These improvements are particularly marked in the urban
 centers to which there is a steady migration of people from
 the rural areas. The Government is continuing its efforts to
 increase enrollment in-primary and secondary schools and to
 find employment for graduates. Almost 58 percent of primary
 school-aged males and 38 percent of females in the same age
 group are presently.enrolled in primary education, and
 approximately 12 percent of secondary school-aged minors
 attend school. Adult literacy remains low (-estimated at 5-10
 percent), however, especially in the rural areas.
 While there are industry-wide statutes on the minimum age for
 employment of children, the economic situation in Senegal has
 created an environment wherein a substantial number of
 underage workers are employed, particularly in cottage
 industry. Through collective bargaining, principally by the
 National Confederation of Senegalese Workers, there are legal
 guidelines for occupational safety and health, minimum wages,
 and limits on working hours.
 Traditional values, both societal and religious (chiefly
 Islamic), have limited women's access to certain types of
 employment and higher education. There are, however, no legal
 hindrances to advancement for women and, as noted, they are
 present in respectable numbers in the governmental and private
 sectors. Women, including several professors at the
 University of Dakar, are prominent among Senegal's
 intellectual elite. Senegal also has several active
 organizations promoting women's rights, including the
 Federation of Women's Rights which held a two-week conference
 in March 1984. The Federation has ties to a number-of women's
 groups in Africa and, since 1979, has been a sister
 organization of-the National Council of Negro Women in the
 United States.
