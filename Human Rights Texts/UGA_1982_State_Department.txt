 UGANDA
 More than three years have passed since the overthrow of Idi Amin,
 and President Obote has now completed two years of a five-year
 elected term, which began with the December 1980 general election.
 The governmental structure of Uganda consists of a strong
 presidency and an elected parliament. In practice, power is quite
 widely dispersed with the cabinet, individual ministers, party
 chiefs, and security forces personnel sharing decision-making
 powers on a decentralized basis. During 1982 the President
 relied heavily on the security forces' support because of the
 continuing anti-government guerrilla activity. An opposition
 party functions openly, and various newspapers and newsletters
 continue to publish with only sporadic government interference.
 Weapons in and out of government hands are abundant and control
 of violence -- whether inflicted by guerrillas, common criminals,
 undisciplined security force members, party officials, or tradi-
 tional cattle raiders -- remains the Government's most important
 and elusive task.
 In the post-election period, the Government has followed economic
 policies designed to strengthen the country's economy -- espe-
 cially its food crop production -- which has steadily improved.
 Inflation, scarcities, and poorly operating state-owned enter-
 prises continue to be serious problems to overcome. Uganda's
 approach to development and recovery has drawn support from a
 wide spectrum of foreign countries, though the bulk of this
 assistance comes from Western countries, the IMF, and the World
 Bank. Because of the tragedy of the Amin years, the destruction
 of war, chaos of the interim post-war governments, and still
 unresolved internal security problems, Uganda remains one of the
 world's least developed countries.
 Security force personnel on occasion detain suspects without trial,
 or in many cases fail to initiate the legal procedures required
 for detention under Uganda's detention law. Even more troubling
 is the interrogation of suspects at military barracks or non-
 prison places of detention, which has resulted in continuing
 reports of torture, deaths, and disappearances of people taken
 for questioning. Amnesty International in its 1982 report,
 covering developments in 1981, identified these areas as the major
 human rights problems in Uganda today. However, Ugandan prisons
 run by the Ministry of Internal Affairs' prison service are
 considered to be well run by supporters as well as critics of the
 Government. Massive roundups of suspected guerrillas, however,
 have been phased out.
 Anti-government guerrilla attacks have continued sporadically and
 account for occasional assassinations of government or Uganda
 Peoples Congress officials. The frequency and impact of such
 attacks have fallen considerably from the previous year's level.
 Security and economic activity have improved greatly in most of
 West Nile Province following the fighting in 1981 between govern-
 ment forces and former Amin soldiers, which devastated the Arua
 area and drove tens of thousands of refugees into Zaire and Sudan.
 A substantial number of refugees -- especially women and children
 -- have now returned from Zaire and resumed farming their lands
 in West Nile. Security has improved in the area east of Kampala
 (Mukono district) but deteriorated during 1982 in areas south and
 west of the city (Mpigi, Lowe, and Mubende districts). As a
 result of apparent successes by government security forces in
 capturing guerrillas and destroying their bases of operation,
 security incidents in these troubled districts have gradually
 decreased, and areas once deserted as a result of fighting or
 
 
 338
 searches for guerrillas are beginning to recover from the violence
 and widespread looting which both sides had engaged in earlier in
 the year.
 New problems have afflicted southwestern districts of Uganda as a
 result of tribal and political antagonisms which forced thousands
 of people of undetermined citizenship, almost all of whom had
 lived in Uganda for over a decade, to flee to Rwanda or be moved
 forcibly into camps established by the Government of Uganda.
 Thousands of former Amin soldiers who had been held without trial
 since mid-1979 were released in 1982 along with a substantial
 number of post-election detainees. Under pressure from the
 Ugandan Government, the Kampala-based resident representative of
 the International Committee of the Red Cross and his staff
 departed from Uganda early in 1982.
 Trade union activity in Uganda's predominantly agrarian economy
 remains at a low level. Freedom of religious choice and practice
 is well protected. Women enjoy equal rights, although they face
 cultural inhibitions in exercising them to the fullest.
 Trends either long or short in term are not easily assessed.
 Security has improved greatly in some parts of the country while
 deteriorating in other areas. The agricultural sector of the
 economy has improved steadily, but other areas are suffering from
 lack of resources, lapses in Uganda's once strong public service
 ethic, and inflation. In general, the overall economic and
 security situation by the end of 1982 showed improvement over the
 period a year earlier and a great improvement over the immediate
 post-war period of interim governments. The return to law and
 order, due process, and increased respect for human rights has
 been slower than expected, and seems likely to be achieved only in
 parallel with progress in reconciling current political and
 tribal conflicts.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 Killings occur in Uganda for many and varied political and
 non-political reasons. Guerrillas kill members of the security
 forces, civilian officials, and party officials. In West Nile
 Province, former Amin soldiers also are reported to have killed
 large numbers of innocent civilians trying to flee from areas
 controlled by these guerrilla fighters. Security forces kill
 guerrillas. Innocent civilians also frequently bear the brunt of
 violence which accompanies security force reaction to guerrilla
 acts of terrorism and sweeps through populated areas in search of
 guerrillas, their supporters, and their camps. In the past year,
 there have been at least two occasions in which substantial
 numbers of bodies have reportedly been found on the shore of Lake
 Victoria near Entebbe and in a swampy area of Mpigi district --
 with resulting accusations that the killings were carried out by
 security forces, and counter-accusations of guerrilla culpability.
 On another occasion in February, patients were reportedly dragged
 out of Kampala hospitals by soldiers, and several of their
 bodies were later found. Amnesty International has expressed
 particular concern about extra-legal executions. Many killings
 occur for common criminal reasons connected with theft or extortion.
 It is impossible to determine the rationale behind most killings.
 In January, a Democratic Party member of parliament and a Uganda
 Peoples Congress Party official who was also manager of the
 Housing Corporation were killed together by a squad of assassins.
 
 
 339
 The motivation almost certainly was political, but the respon-
 sibility has never been fixed. Most observers agree that the
 situation is complicated by the Government's difficulty in con-
 trolling its security forces, whose members are too often poorly
 recruited, trained, and led. Uganda Peoples Congress officials
 acting at local levels also have been accused of contributing to
 Uganda's violence by acting on their own initiative to eliminate
 political opponents. Particularly to be singled out in terms of
 politically motivated acts of terrorism are the guerrilla groups
 whose leaders contested the 1980 elections, and then went into
 armed opposition, claiming that the election results had been
 altered by the electoral commission of the provisional military
 government. These guerrilla leaders -- through killings they
 direct and through the retaliatory acts of violence they trigger
 by security forces reacting to acts of real or alleged terrorism
 -- bear a large part of the responsibility for losses of innocent
 lives in Uganda. There are credible indications that anti-
 government groups receive external aid in Various forms.
 The Government has sought to increase training of security
 force members and to improve discipline and leadership within the
 security forces; Its acceptance of offers of foreign assistance,
 including a British Commonwealth training team, is designed to
 promote more disciplined behavior in the future by Uganda's
 security forces.
 b. Disappearance
 Disappearances resulting from abduction or detention of indivi-
 duals by security force members occur. Though reports of abduc-
 tion occur regularly few are or can be confirmed. Amnesty Inter-
 national has expressed concern about widespread reports of dis-
 appearances. Most detained persons are ultimately released or
 turned over to police for investigation and prosecution where
 evidence warrants. Some are subjected to mistreatment and
 extortion of money before they are released or placed in police
 custody. Reports of torture are widely circulated, and some
 innocent people reportedly have died of injuries or malnutrition
 while held in barracks or other non-prison places of detention
 and interrogation. The Government has acted at times to obtain
 the release of people held in barracks, but it has not been
 effective to date in completely ending these practices. The
 guerrillas are also implicated in deaths and disappearances, but
 firm estimates of those involved as a result of the actions of
 security forces or guerrillas are not available. The Government
 publishes occasionally a listing of detained persons, though the
 list clearly covers only those individuals for whom the proce-
 dural requirements of Uganda's detention act have been met.
 c. Torture
 As noted above, there are reports of the use of torture
 as a technique of interrogation or extortion. Barracks and
 isolated houses used for interrogation purposes are generally
 cited as the places where torture occurs. Few reports allege any
 frequent use of torture at locations outside the vicinity of
 Kampala and Entebbe. Torture by most accounts does not occur at
 prisons controlled by civilian police. Makindye Barracks in
 Kampala is the most notorious of the locations where torture is
 alleged to occur. Critics charge government leaders with condon-
 ing or acquiescing in acts of torture rather than with directing
 such acts. Government officials deny torture is officially
 sanctioned, but admit it has occurred as a result of indiscipline
 among security forces. The Government claims it has disciplined
 security force personnel for practicing torture when sufficient
 
 
 340
 evidence is available. Torture is another area of concern to
 Amnesty International.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Most reports of cruel and inhuman treatment concern those
 persons detained in military barracks and other places of
 "temporary" detention, where food and medical treatment are
 generally inadequate. It was at a military barracks where two
 US correspondents were whipped while being detained without
 charges. Uganda's justice and prison systems operate very well
 within the limits of available physical resources. Punishments
 are neither cruel nor inhuman, and prison care is fairly good.
 The Catholic Cardinal of Uganda, other religious leaders, and
 diplomats who have visited Uganda's prison facilities concluded
 that they appear to be well run and that care afforded to
 prisoners is reasonably good.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 It appears likely that hundreds of people continue to be held
 under detention without trial -- not counting those who are held
 in barracks or other non-prison locations. Over the past two
 years, the Government has released some 5,000 former Amin soldiers
 and associated individuals who had been detained since mid-1979.
 Few such soldiers now remain in detention following the
 Government's periodic releases. Those presently held arbitrarily
 or under Uganda's preventive detention laws are a mixture of
 criminal and political suspects. The Government defends its use
 of detention on the grounds that its police force and prosecutors
 are not up to the task of massing and presenting evidence in
 individual cases promptly. Accordingly, the Government states
 that it will use detention until such time as its police and
 prosecutors are staffed and trained to permit close adherence to
 Uganda's legal requirements with respect to due process and fair
 trials. ,Habeas corpus provisions exist in Uganda's legal system,
 but attempts by detainees to avail themselves of this protection
 generally have been frustrated by lack of cooperation by police,
 prison, or military authorities. Amnesty International has con-
 centrated its efforts on seeking release of persons arbitrarily
 arrested and imprisoned.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Uganda's courts now enjoy a good reputation for independence and
 impartiality. In 1981, for example, Idi Amin's close advisor,
 Bob Astles, was acquitted by a Ugandan judge of charges of murder
 brought by government prosecutors in a celebrated criminal case.
 The trials that are held are public and allow procedural safe-
 guards and effective counsel along the lines of traditional
 British legal practice. There are no special courts established
 to hear cases involving security-related crimes. Guerrilla
 leader Balaki Kirya who was arrested in August has been accorded
 due process though not a speedy trial. Appeals of all cases are
 to higher civil courts.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Government has conducted security sweeps of residential areas
 in and around Kampala over the past year, in which thousands of
 young men were detained as suspected guerrillas. All but a few
 were released within 24 hours. No warrants are required or
 obtained for soldiers, police, and intelligence personnel. Forced
 entry is used when deemed appropriate by security personnel.
 There are no reports of bugging, demolition, or sealing of homes.
 
 
 341
 In mid-1982 the Government arbitrarily ordered large numbers of
 residents in the vicinity of the Ministry of Defense to vacate
 their homes, but after a short time it relented and permitted
 these residents to return home.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Some criticism of the Government by the parliamentary opposition
 and the press is tolerated. Despite past closing of some news-
 papers and the arrest of the staff of Munnansi, an opposition
 party newsletter, for several weeks in mid-1982, independent
 newspapers continue to publish news critical of the Government,
 and Munnansi continues to be published on a weekly basis. In these
 publications, security incidents are reported, and the Democratic
 Party regularly attacks the Government for alleged violations of
 human rights and other shortcomings. There is no active censor-
 ship of internal or external publications, though few of the
 latter are to be found in Uganda because of scarcity of foreign
 exchange. The overall insecure conditions within the country
 create an environment in which complete freedom of speech and
 press is discouraged. The Government owns and operates radio
 and television stations and also operates the most widely read
 English-language daily newspaper. These media have carried
 regular coverage of parliamentary debates including opposition
 criticisms of the Government. They also give occasional, limited
 coverage to press conferences by Democratic Party President
 General Ssemogerere. Makerere University continues to recover
 from the oppression of the Amin era. Teaching positions are
 available to members of the Democratic Party and at graduation
 ceremonies in December 1982, President Obote gave a speech in
 which he strongly defended academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Problems of insecurity have acted in general to limit assembly.
 The ruling Uganda Peoples Congress party has held numerous
 political rallies. The opposition Democratic Party has not felt
 it safe under existing security conditions to do so. The Demo-
 cratic Party has held regular meetings of its parliamentarians
 and also has organized conferences to discuss development and
 other issues under the auspices of its Foundation for African
 Development. Trade unions are not active. Uganda's industrial
 capacity has suffered enormously over the past ten years and what
 remains of the trade union movement has not been active in tradi-
 tional trade union activities. The ruling Uganda Peoples Congress
 Party's efforts to maintain its influence in the labor movement
 have drawn the Government into union affairs. Though the Govern-
 ment neither prohibits nor discourages strikes, there were no
 organized strikes or other labor protests during 1982. Profes-
 sional associations of doctors, attorneys, engineers, and account-
 ants operate without hindrance, as do business associations such
 as Rotary International. The Government keeps a close watch on
 contacts by union leaders with outside parties and controls the
 assistance the unions may receive from outside sources.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion, and freedom of religious choice
 and practice is generally well respected. There is no dominant
 religion, nor are there any restrictions on ceremonies or reli-
 gious teaching. Conversion between religions is not obstructed.
 There is no government policy which provides an advantage for
 adherents of one religious group over those of another. However,
 
 
 342
 some tribes have one predominant religion, and discrimination
 along tribal lines does exist. Favoritism doubtless occurs in
 some hiring and promotional situations, as adherents of one or
 another religion seek to help members of their own sect. During
 1982 there were isolated occasions in whichsoldiers entered and
 desecrated Catholic and Protestant churches in searches for
 suspected guerrillas or their supporters. Such an incident at
 the Rubaga Cathedral (Catholic) in Kampala in February 1982
 raised concerns for a time that the Government might fall
 into a confrontation with the church, but conciliatory meetings
 appear to have brought a resolution.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 In general, domestic movement and foreign travel are not impeded.
 However, specific problems arise because of roadblocks manned by
 security forces, which on occasion extort money or goods from
 merchants and other travelers. Lack of foreign exchange is the
 main constraint on foreign travel. The Government has welcomed
 back citizens returning from exile. It does not have a policy of
 obstructing emigration. The parliament recently passed a law
 which encourages property owners, especially Uganda's former
 Asian residents, whose land, businesses, or houses were confis-
 cated by the Amin government to return and reclaim their proper-
 ties. Until recently, Uganda has been a good host to refugees --
 mainly from Rwanda -- who have come to Uganda in large numbers
 over many years. It has not been government policy or practice
 to force refugees to return to their country of origin. In
 October of 1982, however, tribal and political animosities in
 southwestern districts and government suspicion that ethnic
 Rwandans have been involved in guerrilla and criminal activities,
 resulted in local district officials in southwestern districts
 deciding forcibly to resettle ethnic Rwandans and others in
 established camps. Uganda Peoples Congress youth groups in the
 area harassed the refugees. Although some went to the camps, tens
 of thousands fled to Rwanda. The rapidity of the move forced most
 Rwandans to leave most of their property behind in Uganda.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Uganda has a parliamentary style Government headed by an elected
 president who is from the majority party in an elected parliament.
 Decision-making power is quite widely shared by the president,
 cabinet ministers, party leaders, and security forces officials.
 Given the insecure conditions in the country, President Obote's
 position has depended to a substantial extent on the support of
 Ugandan and Tanzanian military forces; the latter were withdrawn
 in stages during 1981. The Uganda Peoples Congress, which won
 the election with a substantial majority of victories in the 1980
 parliamentary elections (since strengthened by crossovers of
 several Democratic Party members of parliament), narrowly topped
 the Democratic Party in terms of total popular vote. The Demo-
 cratic Party leadership, while disputing the election result,
 nonetheless accepted the role of parliamentary opposition. In
 this capacity, the opposition has been active and outspoken in
 criticism of government policies. The Democratic Party offers an
 important alternative for persons who oppose the Obote Government
 and who wish to pursue change within the constitutional system.
 There has been broad participation in Uganda's electoral process,
 which is based on universal adult suffrage. A Commonwealth
 observer team reported flaws in the 1980 elections, but concluded
 overall that they reflected a valid electoral exercise. Women
 are less active than men in the political life of the country.
 Though they are not barred from a more active role by law or
 
 
 343
 policies of the respective parties, they are inhibited by tradi-
 tion and culture. One woman is deputy secretary-general of the
 ruling Uganda Peoples Congress party.
 During Uganda's period of independence, governments have tended
 to be based on some ethnic groups to the exclusion of others.
 President Obote draws particular support from the northern Langi
 tribe of which he is a member and the neighboring Acholi and Iteso
 tribes. The Baganda, the largest single ethnic group in the
 country, have tended to be excluded from a leadership role in
 Government.
 3.   Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Government has been criticized strongly in Amnesty
 International reports for violations of human rights. The
 Government denies the accuracy of the Amnesty reports, which it
 asserts were based on information supplied by its opponents.
 There have been occasional visits by church groups concerned with
 human rights, and there was a visit to Uganda by a two-person
 Amnesty International delegation early in 1982. The Government
 generally has been cooperative in arranging meetings with such
 officials. The Ugandan Government pressured the International
 Committee of the Red Cross director and his staff to leave Uqanda
 early in 1982. The Government later said it would permit prison
 visits in Uganda by the representative in Nairobi. However, to
 date no formal agreement has been made to permit resumed prisoner
 visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross. The
 Democratic Party, the Church of Uganda, and the Catholic Church
 have been active through public statements and meetings with
 government officials in attempting to protect individual
 liberties. The Uganda Red Cross with support of the League of
 International Red Cross Organizations is active in providing
 humanitarian assistance. Results have-not been dramatic, but
 these independent actions have helped to focus attention on
 important problems in the area of human rights.
 4.   Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Uganda, a nation of 13 million with a population growth rate of
 about 2.8 percent, remains one of the world's poorest countries.
 Per capita income is about $284. Its economy, infrastructure,
 and institutions have suffered heavily as a result of the Amin
 years, war and post-war chaos, and violence. The Government is
 pursuing policies designed to increase production by providing
 attractive incentives to small farmers and other producers.
 Floating of the Ugandan shilling, creation of a second tier
 foreign exchange auction, and the freeing up of market prices
 generally have created a climate in which encouraging economic
 progress is being made -- especially in the area of food produc-
 tion. Problems of insecurity, however, continue to impede
 economic recovery. Uganda receives substantial aid from the
 US, other Western countries, and international financial insti-
 tutions. There are tribal tensions within the country which
 in turn are reflected .in political differences. There is no
 discrimination in law against women, although traditional cultural
 inhibitions continue to have an impact on education, choice
 of work, and other activities. Uqanda's laws are protective of
 property rights, but actual protection is often difficult in an
 environment in which weapons are so plentiful.
 Ugandans as a whole have survived the past decade of chaos and
 violence by becoming highly self-reliant and self-sufficient.

 344
 While the level of monetized economic activity fell to a very
 low point, families have been adept at meeting their own food
 production needs in most parts of the country. The adult literacy
 rate is about 20 percent, and about 50 percent of school age
 children are enrolled in some type of educational institution.
 Average life expectancy is 46 years, and the estimated infant
 mortality rate is 120 per 1000 births. About 35 percent of the
 population have ready access to safe drinking water.
