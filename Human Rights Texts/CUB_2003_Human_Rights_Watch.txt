CUBA
With the visit of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter to Cuba in May,
Cubans were exposed to unprecedented public discussion of democracy
and human rights.But as no legal or institutional reforms were made, the country’s
lack of democracy and intolerance of domestic dissent remained unique in the
region.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
The highlight of former President Carter’s five-day visit to Cuba was his address
on May 14 at the University of Havana, which was broadcast live on Cuban television.
Speaking in Spanish,Carter urged the Cuban authorities to allow democratic
changes and to grant basic political freedoms. He specifically criticized the Cuban
government’s ban on opposition movements and made direct reference to the Varela Project, a petition drive organized by Cuban dissidents to call for a national
referendum on civil and political reform.At the close of his speech, he engaged in a
spirited question-and-answer session with members of the audience—an audience
that included Cuban President Fidel Castro.
Carter drew attention to some of the country’s most serious human rights problems.
A one-party state, Cuba restricted nearly all avenues of political dissent.
Although the criminal prosecution of opposition figures was becoming increasingly
rare, prison remained a plausible threat to Cubans considering nonviolent
political dissent. The government also frequently silenced its critics by using shortterm
detentions, house arrests, travel restrictions, threats, surveillance, politicallymotivated
dismissals from employment, and other forms of harassment.
Cuba’s legal and institutional structures were at the root of rights violations.The
rights to freedom of expression, association, assembly, movement, and the press
were strictly limited under Cuban law. By criminalizing enemy propaganda, the
spreading of “unauthorized news,” and insult to patriotic symbols, the government
curbed freedom of speech under the guise of protecting state security. The government
also imprisoned or ordered the surveillance of individuals who had committed
no illegal act, relying upon laws penalizing “dangerousness” (estado peligroso)
and allowing for “official warning” (advertencia oficial). The government-controlled
courts undermined the right to fair trial by restricting the right to a defense,
and frequently failed to observe the few due process rights available to defendants
under domestic law.
The organizers of the Varela Project, led by prominent dissident Oswaldo Payá,
presented an important symbolic challenge to the government’s intransigence in
the area of political rights. On May 10, the organizers delivered a petition to the
National Assembly—Cuba’s unicameral legislature—containing more than eleven
thousand signatures.Relying on constitutional protections for the right to petition,
the Varela Project asked the government to hold a referendum on a broad array of
civil and political rights, including competitive elections, freedom of the press, and
an amnesty for political prisoners.
The Cuban government responded to the reform effort with a signature drive of
its own. In June, in what seemed like a distorted caricature of the earlier campaign,
the authorities organized a mass signature collection effort in support of Cuba’s
socialist system. Holding marches all across the country, and employing many
thousands of signature collectors, the government claimed to have gathered more
than eight million signatures in two days. With this purported mandate, the
National Assembly then proceeded to approve an official proposal enshrining the
socialist system in Cuba’s constitution as “irrevocable.”
A number of political dissidents were detained over the course of the year, with
some facing criminal prosecution. The Cuban Commission for Human Rights and
National Reconciliation (Comisión Cubana de Derechos Humanos y Reconciliación
Nacional, CCDHRN), a respected Havana-based nongovernmental group,
released a partial list of political prisoners in July that included 230 reliably documented
cases. (It should be noted that not all of the cases listed involved persons
who were wrongly detained or prosecuted on the basis of nonviolent political
expression; it also listed people convicted of crimes such as “piracy,” if the crimes were politically motivated.) The list showed a net increase of twenty cases over a
similar list compiled in January. The increase led the CCDHRN to suggest that a
ten-year general trend away from the use of political imprisonment was coming to
an end.
The vast majority of the year’s politically motivated detentions took place during
incidents in February and March. The first group of arrests occurred when the
government tried to block members of the opposition from commemorating the
anniversary of the 1996 shoot-down of two small planes by the Cuban air force.
Several dissidents were arrested in advance of the event,while others were detained
when they tried to reach a beach in the Miramar neighborhood of Havana to throw
flowers into the sea. While most of the detainees were quickly released, a few
remained in long-term detention.
Among those still detained as of early November were Leonardo Miguel Bruzón
Avila, president of the February 24 Human Rights Movement, Carlos Alberto
Domínguez González, an independent journalist, and Emilio Leyva Pérez and
Lázaro Miguel Rodríguez Capote, president and coordinator, respectively, of the
Cuban Pro Human Rights Party.None of the detainees had been officially charged
with a crime.To call attention to his indefinite detention without trial,Bruzón Avila
reportedly went on a hunger strike that began in late August and continued into
October, raising serious concerns for his health.
On February 27, in a dramatic incident, a group of twenty-one young male
Cubans, including three teenagers, crashed a stolen bus through the gates of the
Mexican embassy in Havana. The group apparently believed that Mexico was
granting refugee visas to Cubans, a rumor sparked by a U.S.-funded Radio Martí
broadcast in which the Mexican foreign minister was reported saying that the
embassy was open to all Cubans, including dissidents. Scores of other Cubans were
turned away after trying to enter the embassy on foot. At the embassy’s request,
Cuban police entered the compound some thirty hours after the break-in and
detained the asylum seekers.More than one hundred others were also arrested.
Some thirty political dissidents who did not participate in the embassy actions
were also reportedly detained, having been arrested at some distance from the
embassy. As of early November, a group of prisoners that included Iovany Aguilar
Camejo, coordinator of the Fraternal Brothers for Dignity Movement, and Carlos
Oquendo Rodríguez and José Aguilar Hernández, president and vice-president of
the July 13 Movement, respectively, remained behind bars.
The embassy incident ended in a swirl of recriminations and conspiracy theories.
The Cuban government accused the U.S. of maliciously instigating the breakin,
while some dissidents surmised that President Castro had engineered the
incident in order to embarrass Mexican President Vicente Fox, seen by the authorities
as overly sympathetic to the Cuban dissident community. The Cuban authorities
even aired a special television broadcast to discuss the incident. In it, Castro
emphasized that “no one who storms into an embassy will ever leave [Cuba],” and
attacked the asylum-seekers as “delinquents and anti-social elements.”
A group of ten dissidents, human rights advocates, and independent journalists
was arrested on March 4 at a provincial hospital in Ciego de Avila. They had gone
to the hospital to visit a reporter who had reportedly been physically attacked by the police earlier in the day while he was traveling to a meeting of the Cuban Foundation
for Human Rights. Reacting with disproportional severity to a minor disruption,
state security police arrested the group after its members shouted statements
such as “Long live human rights.”Among those taken into custody was Juan Carlos
González Leiva, a blind human rights advocate who was said to have been assaulted
by police when he was arrested, requiring four stitches on his forehead. The other
arrestees were seven dissidents and human rights activists—Delio Laureano
Requejo, Lázaro Iglesias Estrada, Virgilio Mantilla Arango, Enrique García Morejón,
Antonio García Morejón, Odalmis Hernández Matos, and Ana Peláez García—
and two independent journalists—Léster Téllez Castro and Carlos Brizuela Yera.
The authorities quickly released the two women who had been arrested, placing
them under house arrest.The remaining prisoners were kept in detention,however,
and remained there as of early November. In September, the Ciego de Avila prosecutor’s
office notified the ten members of the group that they had been formally
charged with the crimes of contempt of authority (desacato), public disorder,
resistance, and disobedience. The threatened sentences varied, with one defendant
facing seven years of imprisonment. Of González Leiva, the lead defendant, who
faced a possible six-year sentence, the indictment noted critically that “he was not
integrated into mass organizations and was not involved in any socially useful
activities.”
The year also saw the release of several well-known dissidents. In early May, just
prior to Carter’s visit,Vladimiro Roca Antúnez was freed from Ariza prison.He had
spent over two years of his five-year sentence in solitary confinement. Prosecuted
together with three other well-known dissidents,who were all released from prison
in 2001, Roca was freed two months before the expiration of his sentence. The son
of the late Blas Roca, considered a hero of the Cuban revolution,Roca was educated
as an economist and had once flown missions as a Cuban air force fighter pilot.
Years later, with his three co-defendants, Blas had embarked upon relatively highprofile
dissident activities, holding press conferences in 1997 and releasing an analytical
paper on the Cuban economy,human rights, and democracy. In the resulting
criminal prosecution, the government had cast him as the group’s ringleader, giving
him the stiffest sentence of the four.
On October 31, Dr. Oscar Elías Biscet González was released from prison, having
served out a three-year criminal sentence. A physician and prominent activist,
Biscet was convicted in February 2000 of dishonoring patriotic symbols,public disorder,
and instigating delinquency, for protests that included turning the Cuban
flag upside-down and carrying anti-abortion placards.
Other dissidents who continued serving out their prison sentences included
Francisco Chaviano González, incarcerated since 1994,Carlos Cabrera Roca, incarcerated
since 1996, Joaquín Barriga San Emeterio, incarcerated since 2000, and codefendants
Néstor Rodríguez Lobaina and Eddy Alfredo Mena González, both
incarcerated since 2000.
The government continued to prosecute people for “illegal exit” if they
attempted to leave the island without first obtaining official permission to do so.
Such permission was sometimes denied arbitrarily, or made contingent on the purchase
of an expensive exit permit.
Prisoners were kept in abusive conditions, often in overcrowded cells. Many
prisoners lost weight during incarceration and received inadequate medical care.
Some endured physical and sexual abuse, typically by other inmates with the acquiescence
of guards. Prison authorities insisted that all detainees participate in politically
oriented “re-education” sessions or face punishment. Political prisoners who
denounced poor conditions of imprisonment were frequently punished by long
periods in punitive isolation cells, restricted visits, or denial of medical treatment.
Cuba retained the death penalty for a large number of offences, but a de facto
moratorium on its use seemed to be in effect.Because the authorities did not release
public information on death sentences and executions, however, it was difficult to
ascertain the status of prisoners facing capital punishment.
The government maintained tight restrictions on the press, barring independent
news reports from being published within Cuba. Although local independent
journalists regularly sent their stories outside of Cuba for publication, they had to
work under extremely difficult conditions. They frequently faced police questioning,
short-term detention, surveillance, confiscation of their notes and other materials,
and travel restrictions aimed at preventing them from covering certain events.
In May, the Committee to Protect Journalists, a U.S.-based press freedom group,
named Cuba as one of the “ten worst places to be a journalist.”Besides Domínguez,
detained since February, and Téllez Castro and Brizuela Yera,detained since March,
the authorities kept independent journalist Bernardo Arévalo Padrón behind bars.
Incarcerated since 1997,Arévalo Padrón was serving a six-year sentence for “insulting”
President Castro.
Despite some limits on freedom of religion, religious institutions and their leaders
were granted a degree of autonomy not granted to other bodies. Several religious-
run groups distributed humanitarian aid and carried out social programs.
The authorities did, however, continue to slow the entry of foreign priests and
nuns, limit new church construction, and bar religious institutions from running
schools (although religious instruction was allowed). In contrast to the first
decades after the Cuban revolution, discrimination against overtly religious persons
was rare.
The government recognized only one labor union, the Worker’s Central of Cuba
(Central de Trabajadores de Cuba, CTC). Independent labor unions were denied
formal status and their members were harassed.Workers employed in businesses
backed by foreign investment remained under tight government control. Under
restrictive labor laws, the authorities had a prominent role in the selection, payment,
and dismissal of workers, effectively denying workers the right to bargain
directly with employers over benefits, promotions, and wages.Cuba also continued
to use prison labor for agricultural camps and ran clothing assembly and other factories
in its prisons. The authorities’ insistence that political prisoners work without
pay in poor conditions violated international labor standards.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Human rights monitoring was not recognized as a legitimate activity, but rather
stigmatized as a disloyal betrayal of Cuban sovereignty. No local human rights groups enjoyed legal status. As a result, human rights defenders faced systematic
harassment, with the government placing heavy burdens on their ability to monitor
human rights conditions. Besides routine surveillance and phone tapping, the
authorities in some instances used arbitrary searches, short-term arrests, evictions,
travel restrictions, and politically motivated dismissals from employment.
Human rights defenders were generally denied exit visas to travel abroad unless
a humanitarian reason (such as a sick overseas relative) could be proffered.
Oswaldo Payá, for example, was unable to travel to Washington, D.C., in September
to receive a democracy award from the National Democratic Institute.
International human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch were barred
from conducting fact-finding investigations on the island.Cuba was also one of the
few countries in the world, and the only one in the Western Hemisphere, to deny
the International Committee of the Red Cross access to its prisons.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
At its fifty-eighth session in April, and for the tenth time in eleven years, the U.N.
Commission on Human Rights passed a resolution on human rights in Cuba. The
language of the resolution, passed by a vote of twenty-three to twenty-one, was
weaker than any in the past. Rather than expressing concern about violations, the
resolution simply invited the Cuban government to make the same progress with
respect to civil and political rights that it had with regard to economic and social
rights.What was most notable about the resolution, however, was that it had the
broad support of Latin American countries,which were increasingly willing to recognize
Cuba’s human rights problems.
Cuban representatives played a negative role at the commission by pressing to
weaken the commission’s human rights monitoring mechanisms under the guise of
reviewing their functioning. In November, similarly, Cuba was one of only eight
countries to vote against the U.N. General Assembly’s adoption of the Optional
Protocol to the Convention Against Torture, a new treaty aimed at eliminating torture
and improving prison conditions.
In November 2001 and November 2002, as in past years, the U.N. General
Assembly adopted by a resounding majority a resolution calling for an end to the
U.S. economic embargo on Cuba.
Latin America
Ignoring strongly worded Cuban denunciations, eight Latin American countries—
an unprecedented number—voted in favor of the Cuba resolution at the
U.N. Commission on Human Rights. Only Venezuela voted against the resolution,
while Brazil and Ecuador abstained.
Although Mexican President Vicente Fox visited Cuba in February, a move
hailed by the Cubans as a sign of strengthening links, the two countries’ relations
worsened quickly. Fox met with dissidents during his visit and, in April, his government supported the U.N. resolution on Cuba. In late April, in what was perceived
as a retaliatory gesture,President Castro made public a recording of a private
telephone conversation he had had with Fox. The recording, contrary to the Mexican
authorities’portrayal of the incident, showed that in March Fox had asked Castro
to leave a development conference in Mexico early so as to avoid contact with
U.S. President George W. Bush.
European Union
European Union (E.U.) representatives formally resumed a political dialogue
with the Cuban government in December 2001 during a visit to Havana.As of early
November 2002, however, Cuba remained the only Latin American country without
an E.U. cooperation agreement. The E.U. “common position” on Cuba, originally
adopted in 1996 and reviewed every six months, made full economic
cooperation conditional on reforms toward greater democracy and human rights
protection.
In October, the European Parliament announced that it would be awarding
democracy activist Oswaldo Payá the prestigious Sakharov Prize for Freedom of
Thought.
United States
Former president Carter may have made the most high-profile visit to Cuba, but
he was certainly not the only U.S. political figure to travel to the island over the
course of the year. Other visitors included Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura,
Tampa Mayor Dick Greco, and several members of Congress.With U.S. business
and agricultural interests applying their substantial influence toward lifting the
U.S. economic embargo, the pro-engagement lobby demonstrated increasing political
clout.
Carter himself called for an end to the embargo during his visit to the island,
arguing that it restricted the freedoms of U.S. citizens. In July, the House of Representatives
voted 262-167 to loosen both trade and travel restrictions, and a similar
bill was pending in the Senate.The main obstacle to change remained the executive
branch, which promised to veto any legislation that weakened the embargo’s provisions.
Bush administration officials tried to counter the pro-engagement effort by
making strong and continuing verbal attacks on Cuba. In May, just prior to Carter’s
visit to the island, Under Secretary of State for Arms Control John R. Bolton
accused Cuba of developing a limited capacity for germ warfare research.Assistant
Secretary of State Otto Reich reprised these claims in October, although he did not
put forward evidence to support them. And just after the one-year anniversary of
the September 11 terror attacks, Reich’s deputy assistant secretary of state asserted
that Cuban agents had intentionally provided false leads regarding possible terrorist
plots.
In August, former Cuban nurse Eriberto Mederos was convicted of illegally
obtaining U.S. citizenship by concealing his role in what prosecutors said was a decade of electroshock torture in a psychiatric hospital near Havana. Less than a
month later,Mederos died of cancer, and his conviction was vacated because he had
not had a chance to appeal it.
