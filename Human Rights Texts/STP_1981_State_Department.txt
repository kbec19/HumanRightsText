 SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE*
 After some five centuries of colonial tule, Sao Tome and
 Principe was granted independence by the Portuguese in 1975.
 At that time, the Movement for the Liberation of Sao Tome and
 Principe (MLSTP), an already existing political party orga-
 nized abroad, acceded to control of the government, and
 Manuel Pinto da Costa was elected president by the Popular
 Assembly, the supreme organ of the state and the highest
 legislative body. President da Costa was re-elected unopposed
 in 1980 for a second five-year term. Sao Tome has been a
 one-party state since independence. The highest judicial
 authority is the supreme tribunal, whose members are proposed
 by the MLSTP and appointed by the national popular assembly,
 to which it is accountable.
 Total population is estimated at 80,000, all of whose
 ancestors migrated to the islands after the year 1485
 from various ethnic groups, including freed slaves. Over the
 years, Sao Tome has depended primarily on plantation agricul-
 ture with principal emphasis, beginning in the 19th century
 on cacao and, to a lesser degree, coffee.
 Perhaps the single most publicized development in the
 human rights domain in Sao Tome during the past 12 months was
 the release from prison of former Prime Minister Trovoada
 after a lengthy detention without trial.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There are no indications that torture is practiced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There are no indications of cruel or inhuman treatment.
 Former Prime Minister Trovoada received visits from his
 family during his detention and apparently was not subjected
 to mistreatment.
 c. Disappearances
 No reports have been received indicating that secret arrests
 or clandestine detention by official or quasi-official security
 forces have occurred, or that persons have permanently
 "di sappeared."
 * There is no United States Mission in Sao Tome and Principe
 and the United States has only limited information about the
 human rights situation there. The US Ambassador to Gabon is
 accredited to Sao Tome and Principe and makes periodic visits
 there.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Sao Tome's constitution prohibits arbitrary imprisonment.
 There have been several incidents of arrest and/or conviction
 for plotting against the government in which it has been
 questionable whether, in fact, such action was taken merely
 because of political opinions rather than participation in
 any plot. Former Prime Minister Trovoada was held without
 formal indictment or trial for two years before his release
 in July 1981. During the 12 months before his release, some
 20-25 prisoners were released, including at least one
 political prisoner detained since 1979. It is unclear
 whether any such prisoners are currently being held.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitution states that "a citizen may be arrested,
 imprisoned, or convicted only under the law in force at the
 time the alleged act was committed. The right to defense
 counsel shall be granted to any defendant or accused person."
 The constitution does not speak of the right of public trial,
 although it is believed the right is observed in practice.
 No trial, public or otherwise, was held in the case of former
 Prime Minister Trovoada.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution states that private property shall be
 protected subject to the economic policy of the state,
 and guarantees the inviolability of the domicile. According
 to limited available information, invasion of the home does
 not occur. In the Trovoada case, however, the offices of the
 United Nations Development Program (UNDP) were invaded and he
 was removed by uniformed police personnel.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution promises freedom of speech, thought, assembly,
 and religion, subject to conditions specified by law. The
 constitution also establishes that all citizens are equal
 before the law, guarantees the inviolability of correspondence,
 and provides for the right of universal suffrage and the
 right to work. It warns citizens not to abuse these rights,
 however, and asserts that the government will punish "rumors
 and all acts of destabilization against the security of the
 state, social stability, or law and order."
 Free political activity is limited by the nature of the
 one-party state, the government's control of the media, and
 the government's interpretations of destabilizing acts as
 cited in the constitution. Assembly for political purposes
 must have the sanction of the ruling party.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The requirement of exit visas and the physical isolation of
 the islands are the only known barriers to movement out of
 the country, including emigration. There are no known
 controls on internal travel. Public statements by government
 
 
 207
 leaders indicate recognition of the right of repatriation.
 There is no refugee program in the country.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 All political activity is controlled by the Movement for the
 Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe (MLSTP), the country's
 single party, which was established in the late 1950's.
 Following the overthrow of the Caetano government in Lisbon
 in 1974 and the decision to dissolve its colonial regime, Sao
 Tome acquired independence and the MLSTP assumed power on
 July 12, 1975. A new constitution was adopted in November of
 the same year, designating the popular assembly as the
 supreme organ of the state, charged inter alia with the
 election of the president. Legislators themselves are
 elected by district popular assemblies for a period of five
 years. The popular assemblies, in turn, are elected by the
 people for a term of two and one-half years. The first
 post-independence assembly elections took place in 1980.
 There is no known discrimination within the party by reason
 of sex, race, religion, language, or social class. Former
 members of the now-disbanded opposition groups who remain in
 the country appear to suffer no prejudicial treatment at the
 hands of the government. Several political opponents of the
 government are in exile, but President da Costa has announced
 that exiles are free to return whehever they wish.
 Women enjoy constitutional guarantees of equality with
 men. In practice, many inequalities continue to exist,
 but progress is being made. Many women are active in
 public life and several have attained ministerial rank.
 All labor organizations are affiliated with Sao Tome and
 Principe's single political party. They do not play an
 independent role in the political process or in the economy.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no local organizations which systematically report
 and contest human rights violations. Amnesty International
 had expressed concern over the Trovoada case, but despite
 repeated inquiries was apparently unable to obtain information
 about his detention or possible trial.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 In his July 12, 1981, independence day speech President
 Pinto da Costa emphasized the nation'q economic problems.
 The economy has traditionally been based on plantation
 agriculture producing cash crops (especially cocoa) for
 export. Production problems and a soft international cocoa
 market seriously affected the economy in 1980 and 1981.
 State ownership of the means of production is the general
 rule in Sao Tome, although an investment code published in
 1980 reflects a willingness to accept private interprise
 under certain conditions. The government is emphasizing
 economic development with a primary focus on agriculture, and
 the US is assisting through a crop diversification project.
 Lack of capital and skilled manpower pose formidable impedi-
 
 
 208
 ments to development. Consumer goods and many food staples
 must be imported and shortages frequently occur.
 Statistical information relating to the Sao Tome economy is
 difficult to obtain. Per capita gross domestic product,
 according to most recent estimates, is about $275. Three-
 fifths of the labor force is engaged in agriculture, fisheries
 and forestry. Unemployment/underemployment appears to be
 high, but no figures are available. Wages and prices are
 controlled.
 Statistical data in such key areas as health, nutrition
 and education are simply not available. The government
 has attempted to improve health facilities (for example,
 through a malaria eradication program and pre-and post-natal
 clinics) and has succeeded in obtaining assistance in this
 area from a variety of overseas sources. The most recent
 figure on the infant mortality rate per 1000 live births was
 6.8 (as of 1975). Population growth at that time was esti-
 mated at 1.7 percent per year. More recent estimates place
 it at over 2.5 percent. Illiteracy remains very high; the
 government is placing a high priority on the improvement
 of basic education and development of technical skills.
 The quality of urban housing varies for the most part
 from fair to poor by developed country standards, and
 tends to belower in rural areas. Access to services
 such as piped water and residential electricity is limited.
 Food, shelter, health care and education appear to be equally
 available to inhabitants regardless of race, religion, sex,
 ethnic background or political opinion.
