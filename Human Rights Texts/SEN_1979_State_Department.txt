 SENEGAL
 
 Senegal remained in 1979 a model for human rights practices
 in Africa. Constitutional provisions for human rights were
 respected and applied. A lively press freely criticized
 government policies. In the National Assembly, the politi-
 cal opposition, before television and radio audiences,
 challenged government programs and policies. The Judiciary
 demonstrated its independence by overturning government
 decrees. In openly contested local elections, the opposi-
 tion Senegalese Democratic Party won control of five munici-
 palities.
 Senegal has been active in promoting human rights through
 international organizations. President Senghor submitted a
 proposal to the 1979 Organization of African Unity summit
 which is leading to the creation of a human rights commis-
 sion for Africa. Africa's first Institute for Human Rights
 Education was commissioned in Dakar in January 1979, and
 Senegalese lawyers are actively organizing an all-African
 bar association that will have human rights at the top of
 its agenda.
 1.    Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Statutory prohibitions against the use of torture are
 respected and enforced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 These forms of punishment do not exist in Senegal, nor
 does the Department of State know of any reports of summary
 executions.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The right to freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprison-
 ment has been observed.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is observed.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 There are constitutional and  legal safeguards against
 arbitrary invasion of the home.
 2.     Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The Senegalese Government's stated policy is to build a
 socialist and democratic society which will preserve human-
 istic values while raising per capita income and reducing
 economic disparity between regions. The government has
 recently undertaken a number of measures to generate more
 equitable growth. These include redressing the imbalance

 between rural and urban sectors by raising farm prices
 and increasing agricultural investments, decentralizing
 and inducing local participation in the development process
 through administrative reforms, reorienting education toward
 the poor majority, and undertaking new initiatives in rural
 health care and family planning.
 On the labor front, Senegal has raised base wages and is
 negotiating a new collective agreement with unions and
 employers. While wage increases will hardly keep up with
 inflation, labor legislation is progressive and social
 welfare benefits are approximately 25 percent of basic
 wages. Fifty percent of government revenues come from
 import taxes which affect principally the wealthier classes.
 Another 20 percent comes from progressive income taxes.
 3.     Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Freedom of speech and intellectual inquiry are respected.
 There is no discrimination based upon race, ethnic origin or
 religion, and the Senegalese record for tolerance, both in
 law and actual practice, is excellent.
 Senegalese press freedoms are respected. The enactment of a
 new press law which subjects publications to government
 financial auditing and journalists to government accredita-
 tion has been criticized for its potentially chilling effect
 on opposition periodicals. But so far, the government has
 bent over backwards to avoid applying the law in any way that
 even appears to restrict press freedom. Opposition publica-
 tions which are sharply critical of the government are
 flourishing. The temporary suppression of the most virulent
 of these journals was countermanded by court order. However,
 an issue of an Islamic periodical was seized because it
 announced the formation of an unconstitutional political
 party.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration.
 Freedom of Movement within Senegal is unrestricted and
 there are no controls on emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Although effective political power is held by the Socialist
 Party, the three other legally recognized opposition parties
 are active and operate with considerable freedom. The
 Senegalese constitution limits the number of political
 parties to four and defines the ideological orientation to
 which each party must adhere. The main opposition party
 captured 18 of the 100 seats in the freely contested 1978
 national elections. Several opposition figures have criti-
 cized the constitutional limit of four inscribed parties as
 preventing the broadening of political participation. The
 government has opened legal proceedings against university
 professor Cheikh Anta Diop for carrying on political activ-
 ity independently of the four-party system.

 There is universal adult suffrage in local, regional, na-
 tional assembly and presidential elections.
 in 1979 the National Assembly adopted a series of constitu-
 tional amendments and legislative revisions that permit a
 minority of legislators to challenge the constitutionality
 of laws before the Supreme Court and improve the security of
 citizens' choices within polling booths.
 The development of trade union pluralism has paralleled
 the country's development of multi-party democracy. Trade
 union elections have been free, with rank and file on
 occasion turning establishment labor leaders out of office.
 Equal employment opportunity is legally assured for women,
 but lack of training or previous employment experience plus
 traditional views about the role of women in society hamper
 achievement of equal employment. The Senegalese Government
 has been studying means to give the Ministry for Women's
 Affairs real power and substance in developmental programming.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 It was Senegal which first proposed that a panel of prominent
 African jurists investigate alleged massacres in the Central
 African Empire. -Senegal also insisted on the publication of
 the jurists' report. The official press in Senegal has
 insistently argued that the principle of non-intervention
 not be used to protect violators of human rights. Senegal
 has taken the lead in proposing an African Commission on
 Human Rights which would have supra-national responsibility
 for human rights surveillance in Africa.
