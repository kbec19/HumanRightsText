GREECE
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Greece faced criticism for its human rights policies and practices from a range
of regional and international actors in 2001. A new immigration bill and the illtreatment
of migrants dominated the human rights landscape and gave rise to a
new dimension in rights activism in Greece. In the aftermath of the September 11
attacks in the United States, the Greek authorities further restricted access to asylum
procedures for refugees. Ongoing discrimination undermined Greece’s
progress toward protecting Roma. Resistance to the recognition of ethnic minorities
remained a systemic problem, with language rights taking center stage. Criticism
of Greece for its poor record on press freedom persisted.
A new immigration bill sparked a heated national debate over immigration policy.
A February 2001 draft of the bill lacked an antidiscrimination clause, violated
the right to family reunification; failed to address trafficking of persons, failed to
acknowledge the basic rights of undocumented migrants, denied undocumented
migrant children access to education and health care, and lacked provisions prohibiting
the arbitrary detention of migrants or their collective expulsion. After
intense lobbying by human rights groups, the law adopted in April contained some
improvements, including permission for trafficking victims to remain in Greece
pending criminal proceedings against traffickers, access to education and healthcare
for undocumented migrant children, the right to challenge immigration
detention before an administrative court, and a time limit of three months for the
detention of migrants who cannot be returned to their home countries. In August,
the independent Data Protection Authority called on the government to scrap a
provision of the law requiring hospital staff and hotel employees to notify the police
if undocumented migrants sought their services because it violated Greece’s privacy
protection laws.
Detention centers for foreigners in Athens,Hellenikon, and Piraeus came under
fire for grossly substandard conditions. A December 2000 Human Rights Watch
investigation at the Alexandras Avenue police station in Athens found severe overcrowding,
inadequate sleeping accommodations, no access to exercise or fresh air,
limited access to medical care, inadequate amounts of food, and a dirty, roachinfested
environment. Migrants who had served their sentences but remained
incarcerated at Korydallos Prison in Athens also suffered from severe overcrowding.
Human rights groups charged the government with arbitrary detention for
indefinitely holding migrants who could not be repatriated to their home countries.
In two decisions against Greece in 2001, the European Court ofHuman Rights
held that detention conditions at Alexandras Avenue and at Korydallos Prison
amounted to inhuman or degrading treatment. In July 2001, the nongovernmental
organization Greek Helsinki Monitor (GHM) lodged a complaint with the Greek
ombudsman on behalf of detained foreigners who could not be deported to their home countries, charging that under the new immigration law, any detainee held
in excess of three months who could not be deported must be released. As a result
of the complaint, seventy detained foreigners were released in late July. In September,
GHM lodged another complaint with the ombudsman alleging more illegal
detentions of foreigners and substandard conditions in the Hellenikon and Piraeus
detention centers.
In June 2001, migrants charged that they were brutally assaulted in a makeshift
detention center in Hania, Crete. Hania doctors documented bruises and other
signs of beatings on 164 migrants from Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan,
and Turkey.An initial investigation by the Merchant Marine Ministry completed in
August found three Port Authority officials accused of the beatings to have engaged
in the “irregular execution of duties.” The men faced disciplinary proceedings but
criminal charges had not been brought by the time of writing. Rights groups
charged that authorities downplayed the savagery of the attacks, which they
claimed amounted to torture.
Migrants continued to face police sweeps and collective expulsion from Greece
without the benefit of procedural safeguards. In a potentially positive development,
in February, the Greek ombudsman publicly stated that sweep operations and collective
expulsions were illegal.
Trafficking of women for forced prostitution remained a serious problem and
the government’s response inadequate. Specific concerns included the absence of
anti-trafficking legislation, the few prosecutions for crimes related to trafficking,
the lack of witness protection programs for trafficking victims, the absence of government-
sponsored services for all trafficked women, the detention and prosecution
of trafficking victims, and the complicity of police officers in trafficking.A U.S.
State Department report released on July 12 gave Greece the lowest rating possible
for failing to combat trafficking.
People fleeing the military action in Afghanistan and other refugees and
migrants who arrived in Greece in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in the
United States were met with a hostile reception. Fearing a large influx of Afghan
refugees, the Greek government severely curtailed access to asylum procedures. In
October, Afghan refugees arriving in Athens charged that they were not permitted
to lodge asylum claims and were summarily given expulsion orders. The Greek
Council for Refugees (GRC) reported that the government had even issued an
expulsion order to an Afghani mother with a three-week-old infant.On October 18,
the GRC charged that the government was in violation of its obligations under the
1951 Refugee Convention. On November 5, a Turkish ship carrying 714 migrants
and refugees from Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, and Turkey—including women and children—
was towed to Zakynthos. The Greek authorities initially refused to permit
any of the persons from the ship to apply for asylum and relented only after a
firestorm of protest from humanitarian, refugee, and human rights groups.
In May 2001 the Greek government took steps to address discrimination with an
action plan for Roma, designed to address health, education and housing needs.
The first successful resettlement of a Roma community—from the Gallikos River
to Gonou—was overshadowed by the inadequate basic services provided to the
resettled Roma community. The self-managed Aghia Sofia settlement established in October 2000 was hailed as an exception to the rule of discrimination against
Roma. Praise was short-lived, however, as Roma children immediately faced opposition
to their attendance at local schools, in particular from the parents’ association
of the Halastra Public School, which closed the school in November 2000 in
opposition to thirty-two Roma children attending. Problems with access to electricity
plagued Aghia Sofia residents throughout 2001 and rights groups charged
the state electricity company with discriminatory pricing practices that resulted in
power cutoffs.
A January 2001 Greek ombudsman’s report found that the municipal authorities’
expulsion of Roma and destruction of their homes in the Asproprygos suburb
of Athens in July 2000 had violated Greek law. The report recommended that an
investigation into the evictions be carried out, but at the time of writing, no investigation
had been initiated. In September 2001,municipal authorities demolished
six more Romani homes in Asproprygos.The operation was halted only after intervention
by the Greek ombudsman and Greek Helsinki Monitor.
In August, the police verbally ordered Roma from the Kalakonero area on
Rhodes to vacate their settlement by September 3 or have their homes demolished.
No demolition occurred though the residents were informed subsequently by
authorities that a process of relocation for the settlement had begun. The Roma
filed a complaint with the Greek ombudsman alleging that the pending eviction
was illegal because contrary to Greek law the community had received no official
relocation plan.
Municipal authorities equipped with a bulldozer entered a Romani settlement
in the Glykada Riganokampos area of Patras on August 29 and destroyed four sheds
that had housed Romani families. The affected Roma subsequently filed a complaint
with the Greek ombudsman alleging that municipal authorities had no right
to enter the settlement because the land belonged to the University of Patras.
An international outcry followed the trial of a member of the Society for Aromanian
(Vlach) Culture in February on charges of “disseminating false information.”
Sotiris Blatsas was sentenced to fifteen months in prison and fined 500,000
Greek drachmas (U.S. $1,400) because he distributed a publication of the European
Union’s European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages (EBLUL) at an Aromanian
festival in July 1995. The EBLUL document listed minority languages spoken in
Greece. Conservative New Democracy Deputy Eugene Haitidis pressed charges
against Blatsas. Numerous intergovernmental and human rights organizations,
including EBLUL, condemned the Blatsas conviction as a violation of free expression.
After two postponements, an appeal date was set for December 18, 2001.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Human rights groups generally operated without interference from the government.
In August the government denied access to the Hellenikon Holding Centre
to representatives of Greek Helsinki Monitor who were attempting to verify complaints
of substandard detention conditions. The organization filed a complaint
with the Greek ombudsman.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
In its March assessment of Greece’s record on discrimination issues, the U.N.
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination failed to acknowledge
Greece’s systematic discrimination against Roma, Albanian migrants, and other
minorities or to make specific recommendations to assist the government in remedying
these violations.
In May, however, the U.N. Committee against Torture issued conclusions
severely critical of Greece, including findings of the use of excessive or unjustifiable
force by police when dealing with minorities and foreigners; harsh detention conditions,
in particular the long-term detention of undocumented migrants awaiting
deportation and asylum-seekers in police stations without adequate facilities; and
severe prison overcrowding. The committee recommended that steps be taken to
prevent and punish trafficking of women and other forms of violence against
women.
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
In January 2001, the OSCE organized a visit to Greece by representatives of the
Ukrainian government to establish a program for the repatriation of Ukrainian
women trafficked to Greece. The OSCE expressed concern that Greece had no
special mechanism for differentiating between illegal immigrants and trafficking
victims.
Council of Europe
In June 2001, the chairperson of the specialist group on Roma and gypsies of the
Council of Europe visited Roma communities in Greece and publicly condemned
the poor living conditions of many Roma, finding many Roma lived in a situation
of “institutionalized apartheid” in Greece.
Twice in 2001 the European Court of Human Rights found Greece had violated
the rights of foreigners in detention. In Dougoz v. Greece (March), the court found
that a Syrian national was held in detention in two police stations (Alexandras
Avenue and Drapetsona) in conditions amounting to inhuman or degrading treatment
and that the detainee was not afforded an effective opportunity to challenge
his detention. A U.K. national brought the charges in Peers v. Greece (April), in
which the court held that detention conditions in Korydallos Prison amounted to
inhuman, or degrading treatment.
European Union
An April European Parliament report on the exercise of fundamental freedoms
in the European Union criticized Greece for discrimination and ill-treatment of the
Turkish, Roma, and Albanian minorities, and the failure of Greek authorities to
abide by final judicial decisions.
In February 2001, the Council of the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages
(EBLUL) expressed deep concern over the conviction of Sotiris Blatsas for
distributing EBLUL literature and called the conviction an apparent violation of
free expression.
United States
In its first annual trafficking in persons report, issued in July 2001, the State
Department gave Greece the lowest rating possible—along with Burma, Pakistan,
Russia, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Turkey—for failing to combat trafficking, to
acknowledge publicly that trafficking is a problem, to implement comprehensive
antitrafficking legislation, to prosecute traffickers, to punish traffickers when they
were tried, or to address corruption in the police and border control, which the
report called “a major problem.”
The U. S. State Department’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2000
noted that human rights problems in Greece included substandard detention conditions
and occasions of arbitrary detention for foreigners awaiting deportation;
the failure to combat trafficking of women for forced prostitution and police corruption
in trafficking; ongoing discrimination against minorities, in particular
Roma; and continuing abusive prosecutions under Greece’s criminal defamation
laws.
