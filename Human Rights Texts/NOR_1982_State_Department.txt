 NORWAY
 Norway has a strong egalitarian tradition, a highly developed
 education and social welfare system, and one of the world's
 highest standards of living. It has been a strong supporter of
 human rights in the world.
 Under a constitutional democratic system, Norway's Government
 assures that the human rights of all of its citizens are
 protected. The Norwegian Government changed in October 1981 as
 a result of a regular quadrennial election. The new Government
 continues Norway's fundamental support of human rights, which
 has wide backing among all of Norway's major political parties.
 The homogeneous Norwegian people have had some difficulty.
 however, adjusting to the limited number of guest workers and
 refugees who have settled in Norway in recent years. The
 Government is taking action to ensure that these minority
 groups are not discriminated against. Discrimination against
 minority groups is not condoned by the Government in practice
 or under Norwegian law.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom
 from:
 a. Killing
 Politically motivated killings have not occurred in the recent
 past in Norway.
 b. Disappearances
 Secret arrests or detentions do not occur in Norway.
 c. Torture
 Torture is expressly forbidden under the Constitution. That.
 prohibition is scrupulously respected in practice.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Corporal punishment is not administered for crimes committed in
 Norway. Norwegian prisons are not harsh or brutalizing, and
 may even include creature comforts, such as piped-in music in
 cells. Prisoners commonly receive weekends of holiday leave
 from prison. During the past year allegations surfaced in the
 Norwegian media that the police, particularly in Bergen, have
 at times used excessive force in the discharge of their
 duties. After investigation of these charges, police officials
 moved promptly to discipline the small number of officers
 involved.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There have been no known cases of arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment in Norway. The right of habeas corpus exists.
 There is no preventive detention.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial exists in law and is honored
 in practice. The state provides free counsel to the defendant,
 and charges are formally and clearly stated. The civil court
 is, except for the labor court which mediates labor conflicts,
 
 
 960
 Norway's only court. It also tries military and security
 cases. The judiciary is independent of both the military and
 the executive.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Police may conduct searches of the home only: 1) with the
 court's approval; and, 2) in instances of hot pursuit when they
 fear evidence is being destroyed. There have been no
 allegations of forced official entry into Norwegian homes
 during the last year. Under the terms of a 1902 law,
 wiretapping is prohibited, but the courts have allowed the
 police to tap certain phones (including some in narcotics
 cases) under carefully drawn and monitored legal guidelines.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Under Norway's Constitution, all individuals have the right to
 freedom of speech and press, and these rights are respected in
 practice. The Norwegian State Film Control Board must approve
 any film before it can be shown to the Norwegian public. The
 board examines the films for instances of violence,
 pornography, and blasphemy.
 a
 Critics of the Government may express themselves fully and
 freely. Journalists have access to sources at all levels,
 inside and outside the Government. However, journalists may
 not publish national defense information previously unknown and
 which could prove damaging to Norwegian security, even though
 the sources may be public and unclassified.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public meetings of every type are common. Peaceful
 demonstrations organized by political groups of any persuasion
 are permitted, subject only to the organizing group's obtaining
 permission in advance. Unions have the right to organize,
 negotiate, and strike, and about 70 percent of the work force
 is unionized. Unions play an important role in both the
 political and economic life of the country.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Approximately 95 percent of the Norwegian people belong to the
 state Evangelical Lutheran Church. A strong, viable minority
 practices its religion freely. Religious affiliation (or lack
 thereof) plays no role in secular life.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government does not impede foreign or domestic travel, and
 Norwegians have full freedom of movement inside or outside the
 country. The right to voluntary repatriation is guaranteed.
 Since 1945 the Norwegian authorities have granted refuge to
 more than 9,000 persons. Vietnamese have been the largest
 group (more than 3,300) since 1975. In 1982 the Norwegian
 Government granted asylum or refugee status to 700 Indochinese,
 50 Latin Americans, and 300 Poles, as well as 25 people from
 other areas of the world.
 
 
 961
 Newly arrived refugees receive clothing, a family allowance,
 medical care, education in Norwegian language and culture, and
 assistance in locating jobs and housing.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Norway is a functioning constitutional democracy. There are
 several political parties ranging in ideology from conservative
 on the right to extreme radical on the left. The party (or
 parties) that can fashion a parliamentary majority after the
 national elections (held every four years) governs the
 country. As a consequence of September 1981 elections, the
 Conservative Party has constituted a minority government with
 external parliamentary support from the Christian Peoples' and
 Center Parties.
 Citizens participate in their government mainly through local
 and provincial elections held every two years, and through
 parliamentary elections held every fourth year. All
 significant political positions are elective or are under
 control of elected officials. All Norwegian citizens aged 18
 or older have the right to vote. Since 1978, citizens of other
 Scandinavian countries resident in Norway for three years or
 more have been eligible to vote in local or provincial
 elections. More than 80 percent of the eligible voters usually
 participate in the elections.
 Norwegians also make their voices heard through public
 meetings, letters to the editor, participation in televised
 debates on the issues of the day, and sometimes through
 peaceful demonstrations.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No human rights group has asserted violations of human rights
 inside Norway or requested visits to investigate alleged
 violations. A small number of Norway's Lappish minority
 attempted to attract international attention to their protest
 against the Government's plan to build a dam and hydroelectric
 power plant along the Alta River in northern Norway. The Lapps
 claim that the construction of a dam will adversely affect
 reindeer grazing, and hence the Lappish way of life. Lapp
 activists have tried to attract international attention by
 traveling to the Vatican to present a petition to the Pope and
 to the United Nations in an effort to publicize their cause.
 They also conducted sitdown and hunger strikes in Oslo. As a
 result of the protests, the Government decided in 1981 to delay
 construction of the dam while the Ministry of Culture did a
 study of the effects the dam would have on Lappish life. That
 study has been completed without substantiation of the Lapps'
 charges. Construction of the dam has been resumed.
 Although there has been little evidence presented to support
 the Lappish position, the issue has increased Norwegian
 awareness that the 20,000 Lapps, mostly concentrated in
 Norway's far north, may have been discriminated against.
 There is a Norwegian chapter of Amnesty International.
 This group, along with many others, including parliamentary
 committees, individual politicians, religious groups, labor
 unions, and other concerned citizens groups, takes an active
 interest in monitoring the progress of human rights abroad.

 The Norwegian government has shown an active concern for human
 rights, particulary in such fora as the United Nations, the
 Council of Europe, and the International Labor Organization.
 4.. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 With a population of approximately four million (4,094,000), a
 0.3 percent growth rate, and a healthy economy, Norway has a
 per capita GNP of approximately $12,653, one of the highest in
 the world. At birth a Norwegian may expect to live to age 75.
 The infant mortality rate is 9 per 1,000 live births.
 Population grows at the average rate of 0.5 percent annually.
 All school-age children have access to free public education,
 and the nation is 99 percent literate. The Norwegian diet far
 exceeds nutritional requirements, and pure water is available
 to all.
 The Norwegian Government seeks to distribute the benefits of
 the affluent economy among all groups in society. Health care
 and education (largely financed by the public sector) are
 provided free or at a nominal cost to the individual.
 Women and Lapps are over-represented in lower income groups.
 However, these groups have enjoyed above-average pay increases
 in recent years, due to the crafting of wage settlements to
 give lower income workers larger percentage increases. Such
 wage settlements, taken with a complex system of subsidies and
 progressive income taxes, reflect Norway's resolve to narrow
 the gap between the rich and the poor. In Norway this gap is
 already quite small compared to that of other societies.
 -Women are thoroughly engaged in government, business,
 education, and other fields. Many of the senior and most
 respected members of parliament are women; the last Prime
 Minister and current chairman of the country's largest party is
 a woman.
 The Government's efforts to ensure its citizens' vital needs
 can work at cross purposes with certain other human rights,
 however. Under Norwegian law, the spouse and the dependents of
 a foreigner working legally in Norway are entitled to join the
 worker, provided the worker has housing which health
 authorities regard as "socially responsible." Foreign workers
 with large families sometimes find this standard an obstacle to
 family reunification, since reasonably priced housing is at a
 minimum in Norway's urban areas. Critics argue that the policy
 constitutes more of a problem for workers from less developed
 countries, while North American and West European workers do
 not feel its impact.
 Norwegians have the right to own property, but foreign
 nationals must apply through the Ministry of Agriculture to buy
 real estate.
 Local and national regulations permit the state to determine
 allowable prices for housing in the regulated housing market,
 which covers roughly 20 percent of Norway's 1.3 million family
 dwellings.
