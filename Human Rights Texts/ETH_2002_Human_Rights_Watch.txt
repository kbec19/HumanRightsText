ETHIOPIA
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
There was a marked deterioration of civil liberties in Ethiopia during 2001 in the
wake of (and partially as a result of) the war with Eritrea. The government jailed
civil rights advocates, political rivals, students, and journalists without formal
charges, and police used lethal force against unarmed civilians. In July, the foreign
minister told journalists that conditions in Ethiopia were not conducive for liberal
democracy. The minister of education acknowledged that Ethiopia’s justice system
had major deficiencies.Government agencies, she said, interfered in the justice system.
The system also often abused its authority and lacked transparency and
accountability.
The judiciary,with rare exceptions, was complicit in the government’s violations
of human rights. The courts routinely granted extensions allowing individuals to
be held in detention without formal charges and without bail while the police
“investigated,” usually at a snail’s pace. Rarely did they inquire into the need for
holding suspects in custody. Court hearings convened every several weeks, only to
have the court uncritically permit the police to investigate for months. Court cases
historically lasted for years, during which time activists and government critics,
apparently held only for their nonviolent criticism of the government, endured
harsh detention conditions. Sometimes charges were eventually brought; sometimes
prisoners were released after months of captivity without charge or trial.
Although the war with Eritrea ended with a cease-fire in June 2000, and a comprehensive
Peace Agreement in December 2000, disputes over its prosecution and
conclusion continued to simmer within the political elite and the enmity created
permeated relations between the two countries. In March, twelve central committee
members of the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), the lead party in the
government coalition, the Ethiopian Peoples’ Revolutionary Democratic Front
(EPRDF), issued a twelve-point critique of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi’s policies.
The dissenters, joined by members of other government parties, complained that
the government had concluded a premature and unfavorable peace agreement.
They also protested the government’s economic liberalization policies and accused
the prime minister of corruption.
The government’s initial response to this dissent in its own ranks was political.
It fired a number of ministers and generals, including the minister of defense Siye
Abraha, and organized successful recall petitions for members of parliament who
supported the dissidents. Later in the year, the EPRDF constituent parties purged
their leadership and ranks of those who had participated in criticism of the government.
That included Ethiopia’s (largely ceremonial) president,Negaso Gidada,
who was expelled from the central committee of his party, the Oromo People’s
Democratic Organization (OPDO).When Negaso’s term expired in October 2001,
parliament unanimously voted Girma Woldegiorgis president for a six-year term
and endorsed a new government.
Against the background of political dissent and stalemated war, university students
in April 2001 protested the government’s interference with academic freedom.
The students’ main demands were permission to republish a banned student
magazine, dismissal of two university administrators closely affiliated with the government,
and removal of security troops stationed inside the university campus.
While the government initially conceded the first two demands, it did not commit
to a schedule for removing the security forces.When students continued to press
their demands, the minister of education issued an ultimatum threatening students
who did not return to classes with arrest. The security forces’ efforts to enforce the
ultimatum set off clashes on April 17 and 18 that quickly got out of hand as nonstudents
joined in the protests. In suppressing the protest, the police used excessive
force, including live ammunition, and conducted massive arrests.At the end of the
two days, over forty civilians, primarily students, had been killed and another four
hundred injured.Other campuses also witnessed antigovernment protests.
The government immediately detained almost 2,000 students; although most
were quickly released, several hundred were shipped to prisons two hundred kilometers
or more from the capital.Aside from those arrested, over one hundred students
fled to Kenya and another seventy or so to Djibouti.
Also arrested in the weeks following the police crackdown on the students were
members of two opposition parties, the All-Amhara People’s Organization
(AAPO) and the Ethiopians’ Democratic Party (EDP). Over four hundred AAPO
members were arrested between April and June. According to the party, most of
those taken into custody were candidates in local elections.Over one hundred EDP
members were arrested. The police claimed that the AAPO and EDP members had
“a clear role in the violence” and had been active in organizing “hooligans” to riot.
Because of the mass arrests, prisons became severely overcrowded. While no
independent observers were allowed in to monitor prison conditions, prisoners
who were subsequently released complained of poor sanitation, leading to the proliferation
of water- and air-borne diseases such as typhoid, dysentery, and tuberculosis.
Four prisoners were reported to have died, including AAPO member
Gebrehana Wolde Medhin. Although the government claimed that he had died of
tuberculosis, AAPO asserted that he had died as a result of severe beatings, noting
that the family had never been informed that he was hospitalized and the body had
not been returned to the family.
In early July, the government announced that it released about a hundred of
those arrested in connection with the April events. They had not been charged but were nevertheless held two months or more.Another 150 were released on bail.The
government acknowledged continuing to imprison sixteen, but the number of students
actually being held remained unconfirmed. Although the government
released thirty-two of the AAPO detainees in July (two on bail), at least six
remained in jail without charges as of early November 2001. Of the hundred or so
EDP members, ninety were released without charges. Four others were released on
bail. Seven, however, remained in custody without charge as of November 2001.
In June 2001, the government amended its “anti-corruption”law to prohibit bail
for anyone charged with corruption by the police. The amendment was immediately
applied to former colleagues of the prime minister who had been purged from
the EPRDF’s constituent parties. Most prominent among those arrested was former
defense minister Siye.He and seven co-defendants were arrested in mid-June.
In an unusual move, the court ordered Siye’s release on bail but he was rearrested
outside the courthouse. In mid-August, a court ineffectually gave the police a “last”
two-week extension to complete the investigation. The two weeks came and went
without charges or release. In late October, almost five months after their arrests,
Siye and his co-defendants were charged with corruption. Bail was denied.
The amended anti-corruption law was also applied to another prominent dissident
politician, Abate Kisho, the former president of the province known as the
Southern Nations, Nationality and People’s State. He was arrested in late July for
allegedly steering contracts to a defendant in the Siye case.He claimed that the acts
for which the police arrested him predated the laws he is alleged to have violated but
he was kept in custody for four months without charge. Article 22.1 of the
Ethiopian constitution, echoes article 11.2 of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights by providing that no one may be convicted “on account of any act or omission
which did not constitute a criminal offense” at the time it was committed and
no heavier penalty may be imposed than was applicable when the offense took
place. In late October 2001, Kisho was charged with having used his office to make
illegal purchases.
Governmental pressure on the courts was exemplified by the treatment of
judges who attempted to act independently. One EDP member arrested in April
was the party’s secretary general, Lidetu Ayalew. A court ordered his release in early
June but he was rearrested two weeks later and accused by the police of having used
his mobile phone to coordinate the student protests.He, however, was not the only
one to be sanctioned. Charges were also brought against the three judges who
formed the court panel ordering his release. Lidetu was released again in mid-July
without formal charges, after seventy days in jail.
The government also arrested about a dozen businessmen under the anti-corruption
law. They, too, were jailed for months without formal charges and their
financial assets businesses were frozen. Several of those arrested had no obvious
political ties.
Incarceration without trial for months at a time paled in comparison with the
treatment of officials of and accused collaborators with the former dictatorship,
the Derg, and those arrested on suspicion of assisting insurrectionary groups.Most
of the alleged Derg officials were arrested in 1991. In October, the Amhara State
court acquitted twenty-three more Derg defendants and sentenced two to sixteen years. Ethiopian courts by then had handed down 1,181 verdicts, acquitting 375.
After a full decade, 2,200 defendants had not been brought to trial. Since 1999, the
federal government has held 1,200 individuals in Oromiya State suspected of
assisting the Oromo Liberation Front.Half of those had not been charged.The federal
prosecutor’s office attributed the delays in bringing them to trial or releasing
them to the lack of trained police and prosecuting personnel and the lack of other
resources.
Journalists working for the independent press were often the victims of harassment
because of their reporting. Ethiopia has permitted an independent press to
operate, but in the past Prime Minister Meles Zenawi had described it as a “gutter
press,” and denied the reporters access to official news and briefings. In what passed
for “improvement” in October, the government announced that it would grant
“responsible and constructive” independent newspapers access to its information.
Control of all television and radio broadcasting remained in the hands of the government
and the ruling EPRDF. As of October 2001, only one journalist remained
in jail, the publisher of a defunct weekly, Akturot, but there remained pending
charges against eighty journalists from earlier reporting. The jailed journalist was
arrested for inciting violence by having published an article two years earlier quoting
a retired general who predicted the overthrow of the government. He was also
accused of defamation for publishing an article about alleged corruption at a government-
owned factory. In addition, short-term detention was still alarmingly frequent.
For example, two journalists were jailed in May and June for articles written
years earlier alleging corruption by church officials and at the Ethiopian Electric
Power Company, respectively. In July, the government arrested journalists from
eight publications after the foreign minister complained he had been defamed by
their reports that he had had a falling out with the prime minister. In July, an editor
was jailed for 1999 articles claiming that a regional official and that some of the
president’s security detail had defected. About two dozen journalists lived in exile,
including three who fled in 2001.
Opposing political parties have also been hampered in their legitimate activities,
even apart from the mass arrests following the April disturbances. The EDP was
denied a permit to hold its convention in Addis Ababa in August.AAPO directed its
six elected woreda (district) representatives in Addis Ababa not to participate in district
councils as a protest against what it claimed were rigged local elections. The
EDP,while not directing its ten woreda representatives to boycott the district councils,
also asserted that the elections had been tainted.
The Eritrean war sapped economic resources that could have been used to
improve the conditions of the civilian population and its baleful aftermaths linger.
The Ethiopian government announced that the war cost the impoverished country
U.S. $3 billion, including the expense of prosecuting the war and the expense of
rebuilding and resettlement once the war ended. A local research institute reported
that the war had a devastating impact on civilian life through displacement, loss of
livestock and stored food grains, and the destruction of houses, social infrastructure,
and commercial enterprises. The institute estimated the cost of lost social
infrastructure alone to be well over $200 million. Income also dropped as tourism
and international investment and aid fell.
The end of the war has enabled Ethiopia to decrease its security budget by 20
percent, to U.S. $350 million, but the country remained plagued by military threats
from ethnically-based separatist groups, especially in the Oromiya, Somali, Southern
Nations, and Benishangul-Gumuz states. Local skirmishes in which government
and rebel troops (and civilians) were killed and wounded continued to occur
occasionally. These small but deadly battles sometimes led to mass arrests of local
inhabitants suspected of abetting the rebels. They, too, have historically been held
for months or years without charges or trial.
The cease-fire ended the fighting but not the animosity between the two countries.
In June, Ethiopia forcibly expelled 772 people it identified as Eritreans from
its territory without prior notification to the International Committee of the Red
Cross as anticipated under article 2 of the truce agreement. In August, it announced
suspension of prisoner-of-war exchanges with Eritrea until it received information
about a missing fighter pilot. Exchanges resumed in October when Eritrea released
twenty-four Ethiopians “for health reasons” and Ethiopia reciprocated with the
release of twenty-three Eritrean POWs, also “for health reasons.”With the October
releases, 653 Ethiopian and 879 Eritrean POWs had been repatriated but about 350
Ethiopians and 1750 Eritreans still remained in POW detention camps as of early
November 2001. Voluntary civilian repatriation between the two countries progressed
more smoothly. During the war, about 345,000 civilians fled the fighting.
Most escaped to internal exile but others were trapped behind enemy lines as the
war front shifted. In November, the International Committee of the Red Cross
reported it had repatriated almost 55,000 Ethiopian civilians from Eritrea since
1998. In July, it had reported the repatriation of 1,000 Eritrean civilians from
Ethiopia.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
In early May, about two weeks after the police actions involving university students,
the police arrested two leading human liberties activists, Professor Mesfin
Woldemariam and Dr. Berhanu Nega. They were both charged with having incited
the students to riot. The government produced no evidence then or since to substantiate
the claims. Mesfin was the founder and first president of the Ethiopian
Human Rights Council (EHRCO).On the day of the arrests, the government raided
and sealed the EHRCO offices. EHRCO was founded in 1991 to promote democracy,
human rights, and the rule of law, and to document human rights abuses.The
government refused to recognize the EHRCO until May 1999, and often harassed
those engaged in its monitoring activities. While in prison, Mesfin and Berhanu
began a hunger strike. This, together with considerable international publicity and
pressure, may have facilitated their release on bail in June after a month of captivity.
After their release, the EHRCO was allowed to reopen.
Harassment of organizations established to monitor and advance civil liberties
also extended to other activists. In August, the Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association
(EWLA) mounted a peaceful demonstration with several hundred participants
to demand that rape laws be strengthened and more aggressively enforced.At about the same time, it received extensive media coverage for its letter to a local
newspaper protesting the ministry of justice’s failure to prosecute an alleged sexual
assault by the son of a prominent family. Shortly thereafter, the ministry of justice
suspended EWLA’s charter and froze its bank accounts. It announced that EWLA’s
activity’s exceeded its charter,without offering details. In mid-October, a trial court
ordered the release of ELWA’s frozen accounts and the Justice Ministry—under a
new minister—restored ELWA’s license.
In May, a court acquitted eight founding members of the Human Rights League
after three-and-a-half years’ detention on unsubstantiated charges of involvement
in terrorist activities. The Human Rights League was a monitoring group founded
in 1996 by prominent members of the Oromo community that the government
never allowed to function. Other groups that government harassment forced
underground or into exile in past years included the Ogaden Human Rights Committee,
the Solidarity Committee for Ethiopian Political Prisoners, and the Oromo
Ex-Prisoners for Human Rights.
Both the Ethiopian constitution and legislation empower parliament to create a
Human Rights Commission and an ombudsman.Neither had yet been established.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
The economic cost of the war was a key factor in pressing both Ethiopia and
Eritrea to conclude the December 2000 peace agreement. The Ethiopian government
subsequently received generous aid packages, even as it used lethal force
against demonstrators, silenced dissent, and violently repressed minorities in restless
regions. Contributing to the international community’s muted criticism of
these practices was the apparent perception that the dissenters were “hardliners,”
and the government’s was the “moderate” camp.
The dissenters considered the government’s espousing of a free-market economy
and its partnership with international financial institutions a betrayal of the
TPLF’s ideological roots. In a strong sign of support for the government’s policies,
the IMF in March approved a U.S. $112 million loan, and agreed to back Ethiopia’s
poverty reduction program. Likewise, a meeting of Ethiopia’s donors in early April
agreed to reschedule or cancel 70 percent of U.S. $430 million in foreign debts.
United Nations
Implementation of the peace agreement progressed relatively well,but both parties
repeatedly showed intransigence. The Security Council in Resolution 1369
(2001) passed in September extended the mandate of the United Nations Mission
in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE)—a mission to monitor and help implement the
cease-fire agreement—to March 15, 2002, and called on the parties to settle all outstanding
issues. These included Ethiopia’s reluctance to supply maps detailing the
location of its minefields in Eritrea. About 70,000 internally-displaced Eritreans
still could not be resettled because of the danger of land mines. Both countries
balked at engaging in bilateral talks. Eritrea was accused of infiltrating militia into
its side of the buffer zone in violation of the cease-fire agreement but confirmation was difficult because Eritrea restricted the movement of UNMEE monitors.
UNMEE reported that no Ethiopian troops remained in the temporary security
zone separating the two countries.While matters could improve in 2002 when a
boundary commission demarks a permanent boundary, both sides expressed dissatisfaction
with the commission’s interim findings.
Both countries continued to evict those identified as the other’s nationals, causing
great suffering to the victims and their kin, and blatantly violating international
human rights norms in the process. Of concern also was the slow pace in implementing
the agreement’s compensation provisions for war-related losses.
A committee established pursuant to Security Council Resolution 1298 (2000)
that imposed an arms embargo on the two parties complained in a May letter to the
council that it had no monitoring arm and was thus constrained in carrying out its
mandate of ensuring the effective implementation of the embargo. The Security
Council lifted the ban in May. By contrast, the European Union in March renewed
the arms embargo it imposed on Ethiopia and Eritrea in March 1999.
The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child gave Ethiopia a mixed
review in 2001. It applauded the government’s adoption of a new Family Code. It
also welcomed the interim prohibition on the use of corporal punishment in
schools but expressed disappointment that the ban had not been implemented. It
identified ongoing abuses in violation of Ethiopia’s own constitution. Many children
continued to be subject to the adult justice system because neither a juvenile
court nor a juvenile detention facility existed outside the capital; children were
often exploited for child labor; and large numbers of children lived and worked in
the streets without access to education, health care, or nutrition. The U.N. report
echoed an April EHRCO report on the “frighteningly increasing number” of abandoned
children in Ethiopian cities. In addition, rapes of young girls were common;
even when reported, they were usually lightly punished, if at all.
United States
The U.S. continued to show reluctance to speak out publicly against rampant
human rights abuses in Ethiopia, with a noticeable exception in April when its
embassy in Addis Ababa denounced the use of excessive force against demonstrators.
Further, while the U.S. had initially sponsored the U.N.’s yearlong arms
embargo adopted on May 17, 2000, the outgoing Clinton administration
attempted, but failed, to get the ban lifted in the weeks that followed the signature
of the peace agreement in December 2000. The U.N. allowed the ban to expire in
May, but warned the parties it would take action if they resumed fighting. And
despite the close U.S. alliance with Ethiopia and Eritrea, the U.S. throughout the
war put insufficient pressures on countries supplying the belligerents, including
Bulgaria, China, France, Russia, and others, to stem the flow of arms.
In the wake of the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington, the Horn
of Africa appeared poised to gain prominence in a U.S. foreign policy focused on
building a global coalition against international terrorism. Following the attacks,
the Ethiopian government had accused the Islamist group Al-Itihad Al-Islami,
which fought for the autonomy of Ethiopia’s Somali regional state from base in
Somalia,of having links to the Bin Laden network.The Bush administration sought to freeze the assets of that group. President Bush called Prime Minister Meles in
early October and thanked him for his offer to cooperate in the U.S. campaign.U.S.
assistance to Ethiopia totaled U.S. $146 million in FY 2001, most of which was earmarked
for food assistance and child survival programs.
