UZBEKISTAN
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
The new U.S.-led campaign against terrorism dramatically changed Uzbekistan’s
international position, but its appalling human rights record remained
unchanged. The government retained tight control over all media and other forms
of expression, dealing harshly with dissidents and rights activists who sought to
expose abuses. It did not tolerate independent political parties or social movements.
State agents tortured those in custody and at least five people died in custody
under highly suspicious circumstances in 2001.
The government pressed forward with a campaign of unlawful arrest, torture,
and imprisonment ofMuslims who practiced their faith outside state controls, and
took increasing numbers of pious women into custody. Police forcibly disbanded
protests by relatives of religious prisoners, and placed several under administrative
arrest for demonstrating.
Seventy-three mountain villagers were convicted, after being tortured and illtreated,
on charges of abetting the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) insurgency
in 2000 in southeastern Uzbekistan.
While authorities withheld comprehensive statistics on prisoners held on religious
and political charges, conservative estimates put the total number at around
7,000. Local rights organizations estimated that in 2001 at least thirty people per
week were convicted for alleged crimes related to their religious affiliation or
beliefs. The majority of cases involved those accused of membership in Hizb ut-
Tahrir (Party of Liberation), which espouses reestablishment of the Islamic
Caliphate by peaceful means.The government of President Islam Karimov equated
the group’s beliefs and activities with attempted overthrow of the state, and authorities
prosecuted any person in possession of the group’s literature or in any way
affiliated with it. They also prosecuted so-called Wahhabis, or Muslims who were not members of any organized group but who worshiped outside state controls and
were subsequently branded “extremists” and “fundamentalists.”
Those associated even loosely with well-known religious leaders branded as
“Wahhabis”were tried in unfair proceedings on charges of conspiracy to overthrow
the government, and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. On April 9, twelve men
accused of taking Koran lessons and attending religious services at the mosque of
Imam Abduvahid Yuldashev were sentenced to terms ranging from two-year suspended
sentences to eighteen years of imprisonment. The men, who claimed that
they had been engaged only in worship and study of Islamic texts, testified that
police held them incommunicado and tortured them. A Tashkent court sentenced
Imam Yuldashev himself to nineteen years in prison, ignoring his testimony that he
was tortured and his family threatened.
Following a well-established pattern, authorities arrested or harassed the relatives
of independent Muslim leaders. In at least one prominent case in 2001, police
used a family member as a hostage to coerce an imam into cooperating with an
investigation. On March 17, 2001, Tashkent police arrested Rahima Ahmedalieva,
wife of Imam Ruhiddin Fahruddinov, whom authorities labeled a “Wahhabi” and
who was believed to be in hiding, fearing arrest. Police held Akhmedalieva, conditioning
her release on Fahruddinov’s appearance for questioning. Police detained
Akhmedalieva’s nineteen-year-old daughter, Odina Maksudova, on March 20,
threatened her with physical abuse, and forced her to write a statement incriminating
her mother. They also threatened to send Akhmedalieva’s minor children to an
orphanage, “so [they] won’t become ‘Wahhabi,’” and tore off the religious headscarves
worn by Maksudova and Akhmedalieva, ordering the younger woman not
to wear religious dress again.Maksudova was released the next day.
On March 26, when Maksudova filed an appeal on behalf of her mother to the
United Nations with the office of the United Nations Development Programme,
police confiscated the appeal from a U.N. employee,detained Maksudova as she left
the U.N. building, and forced her to disavow the appeal. On September 21,
Akhmedalieva was sentenced to seven years in prison for alleged anti-state
activities.
On August 23, President Karimov issued an amnesty decree for various categories
of prisoners, excluding those charged with anti-state activities or sentenced
to lengthy terms for alleged membership in banned religious organizations.However,
an unknown number of religious prisoners sentenced earlier to relatively
short terms in prison were reportedly released following the amnesty decree.
Notwithstanding the government’s longstanding policy of dispersing unsanctioned
public demonstrations,women in various parts of Uzbekistan protested the
campaign against independent Muslims. On March 21, 2001, an estimated three
hundred demonstrators, primarily women, took to the streets in Andijan to
demand the release of their male relatives,imprisoned for their religious affiliations
and beliefs. The participants reportedly carried signs reading, “2001: Year of the
Widow and Orphan,” a play on President Karimov’s declaration of the year 2001 as
the “Year of the Mother and Child.” Police dispersed the demonstration and
detained at least two female participants, carrying one off by her arms and legs.
Two days later,Andijan police reacted even more quickly to disperse a followup protest. Officers allegedly detained female demonstrators violently, fined them
each 2,200 som (approximately one month’s salary), and threatened to extend the
prison sentences of the women’s jailed relatives if they did not submit statements
asking for forgiveness for their actions. After another similar demonstration, local
authorities organized a public meeting to denounce the protesters.
On April 12, 2001, police violently dispersed and detained some forty women
protesting outside government buildings in Tashkent, injuring at least ten. A
human rights defender who witnessed the protest reported that officers fired blanks
over the women’s heads.Most of the women were released the same day; four were
released three days later. Police allegedly beat one of the women in custody.
September 4, 2001, saw two more protests organized by female relatives of independent
Muslim prisoners, to voice dissatisfaction with the August amnesty decree.
Police in Karshi arrested twelve of a group of about sixty women who called for the
release of their loved ones. As of this writing, their whereabouts remained
unknown. In Tashkent, police arrested another ten demonstrators, including
Fatima Mukadirova, the mother of two young men imprisoned for alleged membership
in Hizb ut-Tahrir.Arresting officers accused Mukadirova of membership in
the Islamic group and placed her under arrest on charges that she attempted the
violent overthrow of the Republic of Uzbekistan. On November 5,Mukadirova was
given a three-year suspended prison sentence, under which she was to report to
authorities every ten days.
In 2001, the government of Uzbekistan took an important step toward transparency
in the prison system with its decision to allow access for the first time ever
to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to prison facilities.However,
progress proved illusory.According to prisoners’ relatives, the authorities consistently
ordered prisoners not to speak to the international observers and
temporarily transferred political and religious prisoners from facilities prior to the
visits. Conditions in Uzbekistan’s prisons remained ghastly. Overcrowding forced
prisoners to sleep in turns.Meals were commonly limited to one loaf of bread for
four men and one cup of tea.With poor hygiene, diseases such as dysentery, eczema,
kidney ailments, and tuberculosis were rampant and claimed numerous lives.
Authorities routinely denied prisoners access to medicine and medical attention.
Prison guards systematically beat prisoners with wooden and rubber truncheons
and exacted particularly harsh punishment on those convicted on religious
charges, subjecting them to additional beatings, and forcing them to sing the
national anthem and recite poems praising the president and the state. Those who
attempted to observe the five daily Muslim prayers were beaten and sometimes
locked in isolation cells for days on end.
Torture remained endemic in pretrial custody as well, abetted by the practices of
failing to notify family members of an individual’s detention and holding people
incommunicado, sometimes for up to six months. Authorities systematically tortured
detainees to force them into giving testimony or self-incriminating statements
and used it as a form of extrajudicial punishment. At least five suspicious
deaths in pre- and postconviction custody in 2001 were likely due to torture,
including that of a human rights defender. In all cases officials provided implausible
explanations for the cause of death.
Police detained Emin Usmon on February 11, 2001, on suspicion of “religious radicalism,” and on March 1 returned his corpse to his family. Usmon, a wellknown
writer and commentator in Uzbekistan, had spoken out on behalf of others
held on such charges. Fifty to sixty police officers surrounded Usmon’s neighborhood
when his corpse was returned, stopped the family from holding a viewing of
the body, demanding that they bury the body immediately and preventing relatives
and neighbors from attending the funeral. Initially, police told the family that
Usmon had committed suicide; however, the death certificate ultimately given to
the family stated that he had died of a “brain tumor.” No independent medical
examination was allowed. Nonetheless, one relative alleged he saw clearly an open
wound on the back of Usmon’s head during the procedure of preparing the body
for burial.
Police also offered an implausible explanation for the death of Hazrat Kadirov,
a displaced person who had spoken out about poor conditions for those displaced
from Surkhandaria province. Police officers detained Kadirov for “informal questioning”
on December 11, 2000; three days later, they returned his corpse. Officials
claimed that Kadirov had tried to escape police custody and then had died of a heart
attack. A person who viewed Kadirov’s body reported seeing multiple injuries.
On October 17, 2001, Tashkent police arrested brothers Ravshan and Rasul
Haidov on suspicion of membership in Hizb ut-Tahrir. Ravshan’s body was
returned to his family on October 18.Those who viewed the body reported that the
thirty-two-year-old’s neck was broken, as was one leg below the knee; that his upper
back was injured; and that his body was covered with bruises. The official cause of
death was “heart attack.” As of this writing, twenty-five-year-old Rasul Haidov
reportedly remained in intensive care in a local hospital under armed guard.
In late December 2000, Habibullah Nosirov, a Hizb ut-Tahrir member imprisoned
since 1999, reportedly died from injuries sustained during beatings in prison.
He was the brother of Hafizullo Nosirov, who in March 2000 was convicted for
being the reputed head of Hizb ut-Tahrir in Uzbekistan.
Uzbek authorities did not respond to repeated requests for information regarding
the whereabouts in custody of Bahodir Hasanov, a teacher at the Alliance
Française, who was arrested in July 2000. By November 2001, he was unaccounted
for.
Journalist and artist Shukhrat Bobojonov was forced to flee Uzbekistan in
August 2001 under fear of arrest. State prosecutors in his hometown of Urgench
had repeatedly summoned Bobojonov for questioning relating to an investigation
of his membership in the Union of Artists of Uzbekistan in the early 1990’s.
Internews reported that Bobojonov had objected to the government’s 1999 closure
of his independent television station in Urgench and that he had even sued to have
his broadcast license reissued.
On October 23, the National Security Service (SNB) arrested Yusup Jumaev, a
well-known Uzbek poet, stating that his poetry, published in 1994 and 2000, qualified
as “anti-state activities.”As of this writing, Jumaev was being held in the basement
of the Bukhara district SNB, where he allegedly had been tortured.
Uzbekistan executed undisclosed numbers of persons by firing squad in 2001.
On October 29, the Uzbek parliament amended the criminal code to reduce from
eight to four the number of crimes punishable by death.
As part of its declared aim to counter the threat of Uzbek militants based outside Uzbekistan, the government mined its borders with Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan,
with mines killing an estimated thirty civilians and injuring numerous others in
2001, according to media and government reports.
In 2001, local and international human rights organizations uncovered evidence
that authorities forcibly displaced approximately 3,500 mountain villagers from
their homes near the Tajik border during and after the August 2000 IMU incursions.
The government had reported that the civilians had fled. The displaced persons
were relocated to centers where they were cut off from interaction with the
general community and deprived of means of livelihood. The military prohibited
the displaced persons’ return to the area even to retrieve personal belongings and
razed their homes to create a cordon sanitaire along the border.
Obstacles to women’s escape from severe domestic violence and pursuit of
remedies persisted at the local and national levels. In particular, neighborhood
authorities, or mahallah committees, thwarted women’s attempts to obtain
divorces and split from violent husbands by preventing them from pursuing legal
remedies when they asked for assistance and encouraging their return to violent
households.The authorities thereby blocked women’s access to the criminal justice
system. These actions were consistent with a larger government campaign to “save
the family” by maintaining a low divorce rate.
Female university students expelled since 1997 for wearing hijab, headscarves
that covered their faces, were as in the past not permitted to rematriculate unless
they removed their religious garb and agreed to pay tuition. All universities in
Uzbekistan were state-run, and only a small percentage of students were normally
required to pay tuition.
Government officials obstructed the registration of Christian and other non-
Muslim religious groups, depriving them of legal status in Uzbekistan. Proselytism
remained illegal. Authorities discouraged ethnic Uzbeks in particular from converting
to Christianity. In 2001 several churches reported that local officials rejected
congregation lists, required for registration, which included members with Uzbek
names.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
In 2001, the Uzbek government released two human rights activists who were
wrongly convicted, but it continued to harass and arrest others. One defender died
in police custody, an apparent victim of extrajudicial execution. In December 2000
President Karimov ordered the release of rights defender Mahbuba Kasymova of
the Independent Human Rights Organization of Uzbekistan (IHROU). A mother
of five, Kasymova served one and a half years of a five-year sentence on fabricated
charges brought in retaliation for her efforts to expose police abuse against independent
Muslims.However, shortly after her release, authorities in Tashkent briefly
detained Kasymova and threatened to arrest her again if she continued to monitor
trials of those brought up on religious charges.
Seven months after Kasymova’s release, on July 3, another IHROU defender,
Ismail Adylov, was released from prison after serving two years of a seven-year term on wholly spurious charges that he was a member of a banned religious organization.
Upon his release Adylov revealed that prison authorities had denied him medical
attention and had systematically beaten him during his incarceration. The
authorities attempted to deny Adylov an exit visa—official permission still necessary
for travel abroad—to travel to the United States to be honored for his human
rights work. Only after intense intervention by diplomatic representatives, particularly
the U.S. government, did the authorities grant Adylov permission to travel.
The chairman of the IHROU, Mikhail Ardzinov, continued to be denied his
passport,which was confiscated at the time of his detention in 1999.Uzbek citizens
must carry their passports with them at all times; travel within the country is difficult
without this form of identification and travel outside the country is impossible.
Persons without passports are routinely denied their pensions or other
government assistance.
Any perceptions that the Karimov government grew more tolerant of rights
defenders were shattered when police apparently tortured to death Shovruk Ruzimuradov,
a long-time dissident and activist in the Human Rights Society of
Uzbekistan (HRSU). Officers arrested Ruzimuradov, forty-four, on June 15 in his
hometown in southwestern Uzbekistan, and held him incommunicado for some
twenty-two days before returning his corpse to his family on July 7.
Police blocked all entry within one kilometer of the Ruzimuradov home and
turned away fellow rights defenders who traveled from Tashkent to view the body
and attend the funeral services. Police threatened to arrest the activists and “tear
[them] to pieces” if they investigated the case further, and expelled them from the
area.A preliminary report issued by state authorities gave the cause of death as “suicide
by hanging.” Shortly before his death, Ruzimuradov had spoken out publicly
on the arrest and conviction of seventy-three men from Surkhandaria province, on
charges of collaborating with armed insurgents in 2000. He also advocated on
behalf of those forcibly displaced from Surkhandaria as part of the armed forces’
“mop up” operation there.
Other members of HRSU in Tashkent, Jizzakh, Khorezm, Andijan, and
Kashkadaria reported being temporarily detained, subjected to intimidating interrogation
and threats, and otherwise harassed in 2001.
On April 6, 2001, police detained Elena Urlaeva, a member of HRSU who
worked on behalf of people dispossessed of their homes by city authorities.Authorities
forcibly committed her to a state mental hospital, where staff systematically
medicated Urlaeva during two months of confinement, causing her severe medical
problems. Finally,on June 30, 2001, after considerable international outcry,Urlaeva
was allowed to leave the hospital and return home. However, on November 6, law
enforcement agents raided the office of the state human rights ombudsman,where
they arrested Urlaeva. Police cleared the office, searched Urlaeva, and took her into
custody.The rights defender was first held under armed guard in a hospital ward in
Tashkent and then transferred to a police holding facility. She was released on
November 16.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
In March 2001, the U.N.Human Rights Committee considered Uzbekistan’s initial
report on compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights. The committee’s concluding observations were frank and highly critical of
the government’s report and its lack of progress implementing basic rights. The
committee expressed grave concern regarding reports of torture and inhumane
treatment and stated that such allegations should be investigated and persons
responsible prosecuted. It also expressed concern about impediments to detainees’
access to legal counsel, prison conditions, particularly deaths in prison, and forced
displacement of villagers. It added that it “deplores the State party’s refusal to reveal
the number of persons who have been executed or condemned to death, and the
grounds for their conviction . . . .”
In its February concluding observations on Uzbekistan’s initial report, the U.N.
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women requested that
the government “. . . enact laws on violence, especially on domestic violence, including
marital rape, as soon as possible and . . . ensure that violence against women and
girls constitutes a crime punishable under criminal law and that women and girl
victims of violence have immediate means of redress and protection.” The committee
also requested that the Uzbekistan government provide more information
on the trafficking of women and girls.
European Union
The E.U.-Uzbekistan Cooperation Council met in January 2001 to discuss
implementation of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA), signed in
July 1999. The two parties agreed to intensify cooperation in the areas of trade and
investment, and to continue political dialogue. The E.U. reportedly raised human
rights and rule of law issues, and future E.U. assistance to Uzbekistan for training
members of the judiciary.The PCA requires that partner states guarantee basic civil
and political rights. The statement following the January meeting praised the
Uzbek government for granting the ICRC access to prisons.
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
In December 2000, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) renegotiated its presence in Uzbekistan with the government, renaming its
office in Tashkent the OSCE Center. Similar centers had already been established in
the other Central Asian states.
The OSCE office undertook training sessions in women’s rights and continued
a series of training seminars for local rights defenders. Its representatives visited
Elena Urlaeva while she was forcibly confined to a mental institution.
A June visit to Central Asia by OSCE Chairman-in-office Mircea Geoana failed
to include meetings in Uzbekistan. The official explanation given by the government of Uzbekistan was scheduling problems. A subsequent visit to Uzbekistan in
October 2001 included meetings with President Karimov and other government
officials. Scheduling problems reduced a planned meeting between the chairmanin-
office and human rights defenders, a group at particular risk, to a very brief
forum together with journalists; the human rights leaders had no opportunity to
present issues of concern to the OSCE head.
United States
After years of relative obscurity in the U.S. foreign policy making community,
Uzbekistan became an essential U.S. ally in the post-September 11 coalition against
terrorism. As of this writing, it was too soon to judge whether the Bush administration’s
“qualitatively new relationship”with the Uzbek government would translate
into enhanced pressure for human rights improvements, or whether it would
be yet another squandered opportunity for leverage.
The United States’ diplomatic initiatives in late 2000 succeeded in pressing the
Uzbek government to allow the ICRC access to prisons.The agreement, finalized in
record time, marked the first formal acceptance by the government of Uzbekistan
of foreign monitors in prison and pretrial detention facilities. U.S. insistence on
Uzbekistan’s compliance with legislation known as the Cooperative Threat Reduction
program, which states that countries receiving assistance under this program
must be “committed to observing internationally recognized human rights,” also
resulted in the release from prison of prominent human rights activists Mahbuba
Kasymova and Ismail Adylov. U.S. intervention also aided Adylov in receiving an
exit visa to travel outside Uzbekistan in November 2001.
In October 2001, the U.S. government failed to designate Uzbekistan as a
“country of particular concern for religious freedom” under the terms of the 1998
U.S. International Religious Freedom Act.
The United States offered security and financial assistance in exchange for use of
an air base in Uzbekistan for the U.S. military operation in Afghanistan. At least
1,000 U.S. troops from the 10th Mountain Division were deployed to an Uzbek military
base by mid-October.Unofficial reports also indicated that U.S. bombers had
targeted the Afghanistan-based training camps of the IMU,which the United States
in 2000 had placed on a list of terrorist organizations.
After meeting with U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld during his
November visit to the region, Uzbek Minister of Defense Qodir Guliamov stated
that the military had benefited from training and joint exercises with U.S. forces
and hinted that he expected other types of aid to be forthcoming. “I am confident
that the kind of cooperation which is being developed now is characterized by a
higher level [sic], and consequently I am positive that the forms of our cooperation
with change accordingly,”Guliamov said. The September 11 events also brought to
light past U.S. assistance to, and joint covert operations with,Uzbekistan in efforts
against Osama bin Laden.
Recognizing the potential human rights consequences of military assistance to
Uzbekistan, the U.S. Congress adopted an amendment to the Foreign Operations
Appropriation Act with new reporting requirements. Under the amendment, the State Department must provide a list of U.S. security aid given to Uzbekistan, how
Uzbek units used the defense articles and services, and which units engaged in violations
of human rights or international humanitarian law during the reporting
period.
In 2001,Uzbekistan received $63.57 million in U.S. assistance and $136 million
in U.S. Export-Import Bank credits, which were granted through a certification
process that included human rights conditions.
