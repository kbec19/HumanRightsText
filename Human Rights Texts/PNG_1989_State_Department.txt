 PAPUA NEW GUINEA
 Papua New Guinea is the largest of the South Pacific island
 nations with some 1,000 different tribes and 869 languages.
 It covers half of the second largest island in the world and
 many outlying islands, constituting the largest part of
 Melanesia. It has a federal, parliamentary form of government
 based on the consent of a majority of the votes of all adult
 citizens. The Constitution resembles those in other
 English-speaking parliamentary democracies, with the
 traditional culture emphasizing respect for landholding and
 individual rights. A civilian government controls the
 military, police, and intelligence organizations. The four
 transfers of power since independence in 1975 have been
 peaceful and in keeping with the Constitution.
 The economic structure comprises a modern free-enterprise
 system combining private, largely foreign, investment,
 government-owned enterprises, and a traditional subsistence
 farming economy that supports 80 percent of the population.
 The private sector generates most of the wealth and
 contributes 80 percent of state revenue. Most of the
 remainder is aid from Australia. The country has rich
 mineral, timber, hydroelectric, and petroleum resources now
 under development.
 There were reports of human rights violations in Papua New
 Guinea in 1989 as the society came under severe new strains.
 The Government had to deal with an insurgency and a growing
 pr6blem of law and order, while intertribal conflict continued
 as a serious problem in the highlands. The Government also
 showed growing concern over mistreatment of women. In
 general, however, the country's network of democratic, social,
 and political institutions sustained a continued respect for
 human rights. These institutions included a responsive
 parliament, an independent judiciary, and a free press. The
 country continued to host, with the cooperation of the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), some 10,000
 Melanesians who have illegally crossed the border from Irian
 Jaya, Indonesia.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 The Government did not resort to political killings. In North
 Solomons Province, however, a small group of armed insurgents
 reportedly killed at least 10 noncombatants, and counter
 operations by security forces also claimed several civilian
 lives. (See Section l.g.)
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and other cruel or degrading treatment or punishment
 are forbidden by the Constitution. An unusually high crime
 rate has created what is proportionally one of the world's
 highest convict populations. Treatment of prisoners is
 monitored by the press and clergy, both highly sensitive to
 
 
 945
 PAPUA NEW GUINEA
 allegations of police misconduct, Allegations of misconduct
 Ste actively investigated by an'Ombudsman Commission, and its
 recommehdations are enforced by the courts. Such actions
 resultdd in-5wards of civil dahiages and punishment of
 offehdinq'pblice officials. "Police in the highlands
 kepoitaly have beaten villagers, a traditional law-and-order
 practice, in their efforts to quell tribal fighting and other
 violen6& there; There have been periodic reports from
 -Bougainville in recent months that captured militants were
 6orturea.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 No cases of politically motivated arrests occurred. The
 courts strongly enforce constitutional protections against
 arbitrary arrest and detention. ï¿½Exile'is not practiced, and
 warrants are required for arrests, Suspects have free access
 to legal counsel.' Both in law and-practice, accused persons
 areiihformed of charges and their arrest is subject to
 judicial review. They have the right of bail except in cases
 wherb judges rble that isk of flight or.further violence'
 requires cbntinued confinement.
 With regard-to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. "Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There were no cases of denial of fair public trial. The court
 system is similai to'thosi in other countries with English
 common law traditions. The law guarantees a public trial,
 with 'observance of due piocess'rights guhranteed in the
 Constl ition. Defendants have the right to an attorney, and
 counsel Is provided to poor *defendants at government expense
 in felon  cas~s'involving violenc.. -The defendant and his or
 her attorney can confront witnesses, present evidence, and
 appeal conVictions. Inf a police and judicial system short of
 resources and confronted with a high crime rate, periods
 between arrest and trial can be long. Such detention is
 subject to judicial review, however, and a prisoner may not be
 held without trial for'more than 6 months. The courts are
 independent of executive, political, or military authorities,
 and there are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary'Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Authorities generally respected the sanctity of the home and
 family and the privacy of correspondence. There were reports,
 however, that security forces burned village homes in efforts
 to quell tribal disturbances in the highlands and in
 operations under the state of emergency on Bougainville.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflict5
 Attacks on the Bougainville-copper mine in the North Solomons
 Province by militant landowners forced closure of the mine on
 May 15. That led to a declaration of a state of emergency in
 the province. The destruction of mine facilities and the
 killing and wounding of at least 10 mine personnel by the
 armed insurgents thwarted government efforts to reestablish
 security or to conclude a new compensation package that would
 permit the mine to reopen. The insurgents were also suspected
 in the assassination of a local government minister who was
 assisting in negotiating a compensation settlement with the
 
 
 946
 -PAPUA NEW GUINEA
 local landowners. .The posture of security forces on the
 island was generally defensive, aimed at protecting the mine
 and its workers. The Government adopted a conciliatory
 attitude, and there was no effort to deny the population
 essential supplies. The security forces had several lapses of
 discipline, however, which included burning of village houses
 and mistreatment of persons. The provincial Premier,
 suspected of carrying information to the leader of the
 insurgency, was beaten. An aide who tried to defend him lost
 an eye as a result of his injuries. Persons in areas directly
 affected by the conflict were resettled in government-funded
 camps.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a
 functioning- democratic political system combine to ensure
 freedom of speech and press. The Government imposed a ban on
 travel to the troubled North Solomons-Province by diplomats
 and foreign journalists but--4fted it after several weeks.
 State-owned radio and television give significant coverage to
 statements of opposition politicians and investigate public
 issues. Pornography is prohibited. Films are censored for
 suitability and classified according to sexual explicitness
 and degree of violence. Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Demonstrations require legal permits, but these are almost
 always grented. The rare denial or-limit of a demonstration
 that does occur comes in the general context of high local
 tensions and not because of the particular cause itself. An
 unsanctioned demonstration took place in February when
 soldiers demonstrated at Parliament over postponement of a pay
 raise.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is assured by law. There are no
 restrictions on the practice -of religion and no religious
 discrimination. A wide variety of indigenous and Christian
 denominations flourish. There are also small Buddhist and
 Muslim minorities. Missionaries-are allowed to work freely in
 the country.
 d. Freedom of-Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within and outside the country is not
 restricted by law. Foreign citizens who reside in Papua New
 Guinea may become naturalized citizens by satisfying a
 residency requirement and obtaining sponsorship of a village.
 Acquired citizenship is revocable only for fraud.
 The Government continued to observe a humanitarian policy
 toward the approximately 10,000 persons from Irian Jaya living
 in camps along the border and toward the related Irian Jaya
 separatist movement, Organisasi Papua Merdeka (Free Papua
 Movement or OPM). The Government also continued to cooperate
 with the UNHCR to determine which persons qualify as refugees.
 
 
 947
 PAPUA NEW GUINEA
 At the same time it worked with Indonesian authorities to
 encourage voluntary repatriation of those--probably the
 majdrity--who do not fear persecution should they return., The
 Government has repeatedly reaffirmed its policy to consider
 the effects of repatriation on a case by case basis (with the
 help of the'UNHCR) and not to repatriate by force anyone
 judged'to be-a refugee.  It also continued to resettle the
 boi de crossers'from several camps to one large settlement
 father from the border, and to express concern over OPM
 activities. "The Government has repeatedly emphasized that it
 will not 'ermit Papua New Guinea territory to be used as a
 base for.OPM guerrilla Operations against Indonesia. In
 September the Government expelled a Swiss citizen, a supporter
 of the OPM who had illegally flown into Irian Jaya from
 Australia and then crossed the border into Papua New Guinea.
 The GoVernmeht'remains sensitive to arguments that Papua New
 Guinea has a n6tal'obligation to provide permanent asylum to
 refugees from Irian Jaya or to help them find asylum in a
 third country.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government"
 Citizens freely exercise their right to change their
 government through direct elections with a secret ballot and
 adult .suffrage. The voters elect' .a unicameral parliament made
 up-of 109 members from all 19 prbvinces and the Port Moresby
 national capital district. Any citizen can stand for
 election, and several foreign-born members sit in Parliament.
 With a multiplicity of parties, the coalition that can command
 a majority forms the government. However, the weak
 development of parties and the shifting coalitions they
 produce has led to instability such that no government yet has
 survived enough no-confidence votes to fulfill its 5-year
 mandate.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 17ongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 It is believed that the-Governmet' would c6perate with any
 propo~ed international or'longovernmental investigations of
 alleged violations. However, as there have been no requests
 for investigations by international or nongovernmental
 agencies of human rights violations in Papua New Guinea the
 question has not arisen. The press and concerned politicians
 quickly publicize, and the Ombudsman Commission and the courts
 investigate and take remedial action in, cases of alleged
 government abuses.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 With its extreme ethnic diversity, Papua New Guinea is not
 dominated by buy ethnic group or geographic area. The
 democratically elected Government, relying precariously on
 loose coalitions, cannot afford to display ethnic favdritism.
 The democratic system has extensive provisions for women's
 rights. The achievements of women-in the modern sector are
 considerable, given the inherent tribal discrimination. They
 serve as doctors, lawyers, business executives  and in
 government.
 Acburate statistics on women in'the paid labor force are not
 available, but the Department of Labor estimates this at 10
 
 
 948
 PAPUA NEW GUINEA
 percent. Family law and marriage and property rights of women
 are guaranteed in a legal system based on English common law,
 although the majority of women still live according to the
 older traditions.
 Violence against women is widespread. Some tribal cultures
 emphasize antagonism between the sexes.- While women are
 protected by. their family and clan, attacks on women remain
 common in intertribal warfare. In addition, "pack rapes"
 against women occur frequently and are often reported by the
 press. Both public organizations and the Government are
 working to bridge time and gender gaps and to upgrade the
 status of women. Several women's rights groups, most notably
 the National Women's Association, actively promote the
 evolution of the role of women and run campaigns against
 crimes such as rape and wife beating. In March the Government
 launched a new campaign against domestic violence with the
 release of a video film produced by the Law Reform Commission
 and the Women and Law Committee. This is reportedly the first
 video program on this subject produced by a developing nation,
 and copies were requested by the United Nations, the Pacific
 Commission, and the Commonwealth Secretariat. In introducing
 the film, the Minister of Justice noted that a happy and
 stable family life is founded on mutual love and respect, not
 on force or fear, and called on parents to show their children
 a good example of how to settle arguments without fighting and
 hurting each other. The film's first showing on television
 was introduced by the Prime Minister and his wife, and the
 Governor General and his wife participated in a panel
 discussion of it.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Labor unions are protected by law and are active and important
 in the country's economic and political life. Over 50 trade
 unions exist, among which the most significant are the Public
 Employees Association and the two mineworkers' unions. Both
 public and private sector unions have the right to strike.
 Although civil servants have never struck, private sector
 unions do on occasion. In September they pressured the
 Government to approve recommended increases in the minimum
 wage. The Papua New Guinea Trade Union Congress is a member
 of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Constitution ensures workers the right to engage in
 collective bargaining, to join industrial organizations, and
 to seek employment. These rights are freely exercised,
 although for the past several years the Committee of Experts
 of the International Labor Organization (ILO) has criticized
 the Government's power to reject, at its discretion,
 arbitration awards or agreements concerning wages. The
 Committee, again in 1989, strongly urged the Government to
 -bring its legislation into conformity with ILO Convention 98
 on Collective Bargaining, which Papua New Guinea has
 ratified. There are no export processing zones in Papua New
 Guinea.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution forbids slavery and all forms of forced or
 compulsory labor, and no reports of their practice have been
 
 
 949
 PAPUA NEW GUINEA
 received except when the latter is imposed as a condition or
 sentence after due process of law.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum working age is 15. However, children between the
 ages.of ll-'and 16 may be employed in family-related work
 provided they have parental permission, a medical clearance,
 ï¿½ and a work permit from a labor office. Such employment is
 rare except in subsistence agriculture.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Working hour limitations, rest periods, holidays, leave,
 wages, and compensation are'regulated by the Employment Act of
 1978.. Minimum wages are established by the Minimum Wages
 Board.- These vary by industry and types of work, and whether
 or not work is performed in an urban or rural area. They
 provide a barely adequate living within the local.context.
 Standard hours of work are regulated as well and, although
 variable for some occupations, may not exceed 42 hours per
 week in an urban area or 44 hours in a rural environment. The
 provision of housing or a housing-allowance is a precondition
 for most employment.
 The Department of'Labor is responsible for the enforcement of
 laws andregulations concerning safety, health, and-working
 conditions. Enforcement of health and safety codes is an
 important focus of organized labor activity. While the
 Industrial and Welfare Act states that there should be regular
 inspections conducted in all workplaces, the-Department of
 Manpower does not have the pers~nnel to fulfill the Act's
 requirements. There are only two inspectors covering the
 whole country. Inspections are carried out only when a
 specific.request is made by an industry.
