 NORWAY
 Norway's strong egalitarian traditions, supported by
 a law abiding, concerned citizenry, a highly
 developed social welfare system and a high standard
 of living have secured the Norwegians a place among
 the strongest and most successful defenders of human
 rights. Norway has a constitutional monarchy, a
 socially-conscious government, and vigilant
 opposition which protect human rights, especially
 those ot the society's weaker citizens.
 A homogenous people, Norwegians have encountered
 some difficulties adjusting to the limited number of
 guest workers and refugees who have settled in
 Norway in recent years. The government is aware of
 the problem and is seeking to ensure that these
 minority groups are not discriminated against.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person,
 Including Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is expressly forbidden under paragraph 96 of
 the 1914 Constitution and that prohibition is
 scrupulously respected in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Physical punishments are not administered for crimes
 committed in Norway. Norwegian prisons are not
 harsh and often even include creature comforts such
 as music piped into cells. It is common for
 prisoners to be granted weekend or holiday leave
 from prison.
 c. Disappearances
 Political opponents of the Norwegian Government do
 not disappear.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Cases of arbitrary arrest and imprisonment in Norway
 are unknown. The right to habeas corpus exists.
 There is no preventive detention, and Norway holds
 no political prisoners.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is protected by law
 and honored in practice. The state provides free
 counsel to the defendant. Charges are formally and
 clearly stated. The judiciary is independent of the
 executive and military. The civil court is the only
 court in Norway (excepting the labor court, which
 mediates labor conflicts). The civil court also
 tries military and security cases.
 
 
 846
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Police have the right to conduct searches of the
 home only with the court's approval, or in instances
 where the police are in hot pursuit and fear that
 evidence is being destroyed. Bugging of telephones
 is prohibited under a 1902 law. In certain cases
 (notably narcotics cases), however, courts have
 granted police permission to wiretap specified
 telephones.
 2. Government   Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care, and Education
 Norway is a social welfare state with a healthy
 economy enabling it to fulfill the needs of its
 citizens. Per capita income is approximately
 $11,800 (using current exchange rates). The
 unemployment rate is a low 1-1 1/2 per cent, and the
 current rate of growth of the GNP is 4.1 per cent.
 Of the average $5,860 spent on annual per capita
 private consumption, Norwegians spend 21 per cent on
 food, 8.5 per cent on clothing, 16 per cent on
 housing, 4.5 per cent on health care, and 8.1 per
 cent on leisure time activities and education.
 (Health care and education are financed in large
 part by-the public sector and are provided free or
 at nominal cost to the individual.)
 The benefits of the affluent economy are equitably
 distributed among all groups in the society.  Wage
 settlements in recent years have typically had an
 "egalitarian profile," meaning that lower income
 groups have enjoyed above average pay increases.
 These wage settlements, together with a complex
 system of subsidies and progressive income taxes,
 illustrate the government's resolve to narrow the
 disparity between rich and poor, already quite small.
 Neither overcrowding nor overpopulation threaten the
 standard of living of Norway's 4,060,000 people, who
 increased at a rate of 0.6 per cent Ln 1979. The
 average life expectancy for men and women is 71 and
 78 years respectively.
 Norway's economic affluence and    comfortable
 domestic situation allow it to be a high contributor
 of development assistance measured in per capita
 terms. In 1979, the Norwegian Government
 contributed an impressive 0.9 per cent of its total
 GNP to development assistance programs.
 Norwegians receive a free education through the
 university level. Education is compulsory from ages
 seven to sixteen.
 The government's endeavors to ensure its population's
 vital needs can work at cross purposes with certain
 other basic human rights, however. Norwegian law
 allows the spouse and dependents of a foreign worker
 legally in Norway to join the worker, but only if
 the worker has access to housing which health
 
 
 847
 authorities consider "socially responsible."
 Because reasonably priced housing in the urban
 districts of Norway is hard to find, this housing
 standard has sometimes been difficult to meet,
 especially for foreign workers with large families.
 Family reunification is therefore hindered.
 Detractors from this policy argue that the housing
 caveat discriminates against foreign workers from
 developing countries while Western European and
 North American workers, who have less difficulty
 finding acceptable housing for their families, are
 not affected. The public is becoming aware of
 problems faced by foreign workers, particularly from
 the developing world, in Norway, and of the fact
 that they may be subject to discrimination.
 Norwegians' right to own property exists. However,
 foreign nationals must apply for permission through
 the Ministry of Agriculture to buy real estate. A
 complex system of local and national regulations
 insures the state's authority to set legal prices
 allowable for buyers and sellers of housing in the
 regulated housing market. Roughly 20 per cent of
 Norway's 1.3 million family dwellings are subject to
 some form ot government determined selling price.
 Women and men enjoy the same rights in employment,
 social endeavors, and in the political and legal
 spheres. Women are statistically underrepresented
 at the higher income levels although there are no
 social or legal barriers to advancement. For many
 years women have held high positions in government,
 labor, and other fields.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Rights Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Freedom of speech, press assembly and religion for
 all individuals is guaranteed in the constitution
 and are observed in practice.
 All films, both Norwegian and foreign produced, must
 be approved by the Norwegian state film control
 before being shown to the Norwegian public. This
 board is mainly concerned with scrutinizing the
 presentation or violence, pornography, and blasphemy.
 Criticism of the government is fully tolerated and
 expressed, and journalists have free access to
 sources at all levels, both in and outside of
 government.
 Public meetings of every character are common.
 Unions have the right to organize, negotiate and
 strike. Seventy per cent of the total work force is
 organized.
 Evangelical Lutheranism is the state religion, and
 95 per cent ot the population belongs to the state
 church. There is a strong, visible non-Lutheran
 religious minority, and its various religions ate
 allowed to practice freely. Approximately two per
 
 
 848
 cent of all Norwegians have no official religious
 affiliation. Religious attiliation (or lack
 thereof) plays no role in secular life.
 b. Freedom or Movement within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Since 1945, the Norwegian authorities have granted
 political asylum to 8,160 persons. Recently, the
 greatest number ot refugees has come from Vietnam;
 just over 2,000 Vietnamese have been granted asylum
 since 1975. Thus tar this year (1980) political
 asylum has been granted to 540 Vietnamese, 71 Latin
 Americans, 9 Eritreans, and 21 from other nations,
 including the U.S.S.R., Iraq, Czechoslovakia and
 several African nations.
 Newly-arrived refugees receive clothing, a family
 allowance, medical care, education in Norwegian
 language and culture, and assistance in locating
 jobs and housing.
 Domestic and foreign travel are not impeded by the
 government.
 Norwegians are accorded full freedom of movement
 both within and outside ot Norway. The right to
 voluntary repatriation is guaranteed.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Citizens participate in the government primarily
 through local and provincial elections held every 2
 or 3 years, and parliamentary elections, held every
 fourth year. Suffrage is universal for Norwegian
 citizens age 18 and older. Furthermore, since 1978,
 citizens or other Scandinavian countries resident in
 Norway for 3 years or more nave been eligible to
 vote in local and provincial elections. Popular
 participation in elections by eligible voters
 consistently surpasses 8U per cent. Women are
 increasingly evident in responsible positions in
 government and the professional fields, but less so
 in business.
 in addition to voting, Norewegians make their voices
 heard through public meetings, letters to the
 editor, participation in televised debates on issues
 of the day and, at times, through peaceful
 demonstrations.
 The Government of Norway continues to devote
 attention to preserving the rights and integrity ot
 the Lapp minority. There have been no recent
 protests by Lapps alleging lack of government
 attention to their situation.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-Governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 NO human rights groups have asserted violations of
 numan rights inside Norway or requested visits to
 
 
 849
 investigate alleged violations. There is a
 Norwegian chapter of Amnesty International. This
 group, along with many others, including but not
 limited to parliamentary committees, individual
 politicians, labor unions and other concerned
 citizens' groups, take a serious, active interest in
 monitoring the progress of human rights abroad.
