 SIERRA LEONE
 Established at the end of the eighteenth century as a
 private colony for freed slaves, Freetown became a British
 crown colony in 1808. In 1896, the British government
 placed the rest of what is now Sierra Leone under its
 protection. For most of the pre-independence period Sierra
 Leone remained two entities, a colony and protectorate.
 The colony, i.e., Freetown and the Peninsula, was endowed
 with schools, as well as the first institution of higher
 learning in British West Africa (1827) and it produced in
 the nineteenth century a local educated elite that included
 doctors, lawyers, and ministers. The protectorate fared
 less well. Only since independence in 1961 has education
 become reasonably available throughout the country.
 Tribal and sectional rivalries have been in part the
 cause of past political difficulties, culminating in mili-
 tary intervention when the first governing party (closely
 associated with one ethnic group) attempted to forestall
 assumption of office in 1967 by the newly designated prime
 minister from the opposition party. After a year of military
 rule the civilian system was resumed with the prime minister
 (the current president), Siaka Stevens, at the head. These
 ethnic and party problems served as the rationale for the
 establishment of a one-party state by promulgation of a new
 constitution in July 1978 after a national referendum. The
 single party, the All People's Congress (APC), has sought to
 enlarge its base and to encompass previous opposition
 leaders, some of whom have been given significant government
 and party positions. There is, however, continuing opposi-
 tion to the APC and to the head of state, reflected in
 dissident groups active in the United States and the
 United Kingdom.
 Sierra Leone is a poor country with an annual per capita
 gross national product of less than $200. The economy has
 stagnated in recent years (the result of declining mineral
 production, an historic neglect of agriculture, rising
 energy costs, weather and pest problems in late 1978 and
 early 1979, and heavy expenditures on the 1980 Organization
 of African Unity summit meeting) which reduces official
 capability for social welfare programs.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 There is no evidence of the use of torture in Sierra Leone.
 It is specifically prohibited by the constitution (Section 10).
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There have been no reports of cruel, inhuman or degrading
 treatment or punishment. The constitution prohibits "any
 punishment or other treatment which is inhuman or degrading."
 As far as is known, health care is adequate in prisons and
 inmates are allowed family visits.
 
 
 227
 c.   Disappearances
 There have been no reports of abductions, secret arrests or
 clandestine detentions.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Under the constitution promulgated in 1978 the president may
 take measures to detain any person who is, or is reasonably
 suspected to be, dangerous to the well-being of the republic.
 A state of public emergency must come into force within 28
 days after the detention, or a detainee not charged with an
 offense must be released. If an emergency is declared there
 are virtually no restrictions on detention. There is no
 evidence to indicate that anyone is so detained at present.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 All persons charged with a criminal offense are entitled to
 a fair hearing within a reasonable time by an independent
 and impartial court established by law. Defendants are
 allowed counsel of their choice. Sierra Leone's courts have
 a good reputation for providing fair public trials. Persons
 detained under the public emergency act are not guaranteed a
 fair hearing (unless charged with a criminal offense) and
 their acquittal after usual constitutional procedures does
 not ensure release from detention.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 There are legal safeguards, which are observed, against
 arbitrary invasion of the home.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 The economy of Sierra Leone faces serious difficulties,
 and government funds available for direct assistance to the
 poor are limited. Agriculture provides the principal source
 of livelihood for approximately three-quarters of Sierra
 Leone's people and accounts for almost forty percent of
 gross domestic product (GDP).
 The distribution of earnings is skewed, with only seven
 percent of national income being received by the poorest
 forty percent of households -- in contrast to the thirty-six
 percent of GDP received by the richest five percent of
 households. The dimensions of poverty in Sierra Leone are
 similar to those in other developing countries: life
 expectancy is 44 years; infant mortality rate is 147 per
 1,000 live births; 50 percent of the children die from a
 combination of disease and malnutrition before the age of
 five; medical care is inadequate; only twelve percent of the
 population has access to safe drinking water; while school
 enrollment is growing, the literacy rate is only fifteen
 percent.
 National development plans have called for improved welfare
 for the population and a more equitable distribution of
 income. In recent years development spending, including
 external contributions, has accounted for 20-25 percent of
 the total government budget. International donors have
 concentrated development aid on the improvement and expan-
 
 
 228
 sion of the country's agricultural and transportation
 systems. Although the country has severe fiscal and mone-
 tary problems, the government is applying corrective measures
 in concert with the International Monetary Fund. Worldwide
 inflation, escalation in crude oil prices and rising domestic
 demand for energy and consumer goods have contributed to
 expanding deficits both in the balance of payments and
 domestic budget. To meet these deficits the government has
 relied increasingly on external and internal financing, and
 the country's indebtedness has rapidly expanded.
 A good portion of Sierra Leone's meager foreign exchange
 earnings had to be used for imports of rice, the country's
 staple food, in 1979 and 1980. One measure to conserve
 foreign exchange, an increase in the price of gasoline, led
 to disturbances in March 1980, primarily in Freetown.
 The constitution guarantees the right to property, prohibits
 discrimination based on race, tribe, color or creed, and
 provides for the freedom of association. Official government
 policy gives priority to agricultural development, expanding
 health care facilities, and improving educational opportuni-
 ties. Infrastructure development, such as hotels, airports
 and roads received special attention in 1979 and 1980 as
 part of Sierra Leone's preparations for hosting the Organi--
 zation of African Unity conference in Freetown during June
 and July 1980.
 Advances in basic human needs are limited due to the
 level of economic development of the country and constraints
 on funds due to a declining export revenue base. Corruption
 is widespread in Sierra Leone and probably has diverted
 significant resources from vital needs and development.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of religion is observed and constitutionally
 guaranteed. The government makes no effort to impose
 ideological conformity or to restrict intellectual inquiry.
 Freedom of speech is legally guaranteed, but under the
 constitution this freedom can be abridged if the proper
 functioning of the recognized party (APC) is deemed in
 jeopardy. Freedom of assembly is legally protected, but
 under the constitution this freedom can be restricted in
 the interests of party discipline. There is no opposition
 and thus no opposition press per se, but there are a few
 independent newspapers which print stories critical of the
 government and contain articles which do not appear in the
 government-controlled media. In mid-1980, an act was
 signed into law which imposes a significant annual newspaper
 registration fee and vests the power of registration or
 deregistration with the Minister of Information. Decisions
 of the minister can be appealed in court. Labor organi-
 zations are allowed to operate freely and are not subject to
 government control, although the government has at times
 attempted to impose its will on the national confederation
 and closely monitors the freedom of unions to strike.
 
 
 229
 b.   Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no official restrictions on travel within the
 country, except those to control smuggling in diamond
 mining areas of Kono District. Regulations governing
 foreign travel are liberal, and there are minimal legal
 restrictions on emigration. There are no constitutional
 restrictions on repatriation.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Sierra Leone received independence in 1961 as a parliamentary
 democracy, and was at first hailed as an example of a
 working democracy in Africa. Political development was
 arrested in 1967 by a series of military interventions and
 attempts at intervention in the political process. Civilian
 government was restored in 1968 and in elections in 1973 and
 1977 the APC became the dominant political force. Following
 a national referendum in 1978, a constitution establishing a
 one-party state was promulgated, with the APC as the only
 legal political party.
 The APC is not particularly active now in political terms.
 Rank and file are active, but more in social than political
 forms. In the past there was broad participation in discus-
 sion and party affairs by the general membership. Now that
 the one-party state has been established, there are indica-
 tions that the APC is looking for ways to revitalize
 itself as a p6litical organization. There is universal
 suffrage and no groups are discriminated against because of
 ethnic, communal, racial, or religious factors. Members of
 the former opposition party hold significant positions with
 the government and party.
 Women in Sierra Leone are entitled to all rights guaran-
 teed by the constitution. In practice, however, the status
 of women varies substantially in different parts of the
 country. In the modern sector, women occupy such prominent
 posts as mayor of the capital city and supreme court justice,
 while in remote areas they traditionally have a more subordi-
 nate role. Even in the provincial areas, however, women can
 fill roles of significant status, such as paramount chief of
 a district. On both official and unofficial levels, increasing
 attention is being paid to the role of women in political
 and professional activities.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no known requests in recent years for outside
 investigation of human rights violations.
