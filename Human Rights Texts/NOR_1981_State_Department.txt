 NORWAY
 With a strong egalitarian tradition supported by a
 law-abiding, concerned citizenry, an extensive social
 welfare system, and one of the world's highest
 standards of living, Norway is among the strongest
 and most successful defenders of human rights in the
 world.
 A constitutional democracy, Norway's government
 (complemented by a vigilant opposition) assures that
 human rights, and especially those of its weaker
 citizens, are protected. The homogeneous Norwegian
 people have had some difficulty, however, adjusting
 to the limited number of guest workers and refugees
 who have settled in Norway in recent years. The
 government is aware of the problem and is seeking to
 ensure that these minority groups are not
 discriminated against.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person,
 Including Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is expressly forbidden under paragraph 96 of
 the 1814 constitution. That prohibition is
 scrupulously respected in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Physical punishments are not administered for crimes
 committed in Norway. Norwegian prisons are not harsh
 and may even include creature comforts such as
 piped-in music in cells. Prisoners commonly receive
 weekends of holiday leave from prison.
 c. Disappearances
 Political opponents of the Norwegian government do
 not disappear.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There have been no known cases of arbitrary arrest
 and imprisonment in Norway. The right of habeas
 corpus exists.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial exists in law and is
 honored in practice. The state provides free counsel
 to the defendant and states its charges formally and
 clearly. The civil court is, except for the labor
 court which mediates labor conflicts, Norway's only
 court, and thus it tries military and security cases
 as well. The judiciary is independent of both the
 military and the executive.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Police may conduct searches of the home only: 1)
 with the court's approval; 2) in instances of hot
 pursuit when they fear evidence is being destroyed.

 Under the terms of a 1902 law, wiretapping is
 prohibited, but the courts have allowed the police to
 tap certain phones (including narcotics cases).
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Under Norway's constitution, all individuals have the
 right to freedom of speech, press, assembly, and
 religion, and these rights are respected in practice.
 The Norwegian state film control board must approve
 any film before it can be shown to the Norwegian
 public. The board examines the films for instances
 of violence, pornography, and blasphemy.
 Critics of the government may express themselves
 fully and freely. Journalists have access to sources
 at all levels, inside and outside the government.
 However, journalists may not publish national defense
 information previously unknown and which could prove
 damaging to Norwegian security, even though the
 sources may be public and unclassified.
 Public meetings of every character are common.
 Unions have the right to organize, negotiate and
 strike, and about 70 percent of the work force is
 unionized.
 Approximately 95 percent of the Norwegian people
 belong to the state Evangelical Lutheran church. A
 strong, visible religious minority practices freely.
 Religious affiliation (or lack thereof) plays no role
 in secular life.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Since 1945 the Norwegian authorities have granted
 refuge to more than 8,000 persons. Vietnamese have
 been the largest group (more than 3,000) since 1975.
 In 1981 the Norwegian government granted asylum or
 refugee status to 415 refugees, including 326 Asians,
 82 Latin Americans, 4 Eritreans, 2 Russians, and a
 Romanian. An additional 1,070 Vietnamese have entry
 permits. Three hundred of these are still in Vietnam
 waiting to be reunited with their families already in
 Norway; the remainder are in camps in Southeast Asia.
 Newly arrived refugees receive clothing, a family
 allowance, medical care, education in Norwegian
 language and culture, and assistance in locating jobs
 and housing.
 The government does not impede foreign or domestic
 travel, and Norwegians have full freedom of movement
 inside and outside Norway. The right to voluntary
 repatriation is guaranteed.

 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Citizens participate in their government mainly
 through local and provincial elections held every two
 years and through parliamentary elections held every
 fourth year. All Norwegian citizens aged 18 or older
 have the right to vote. Since 1978, citizens of
 other Scandinavian countries resident in Norway for
 three years or more have been eligible to vote in
 local or provincial elections. More than 80 percent
 of the eligible voters usually participate in the
 elections.
 Norwegians also make their voices heard through
 public meetings, letters to the editor, participation
 in televised debates on the issues of the day and
 sometimes through peaceful demonstrations.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 No human rights group has asserted violations of
 human rights inside Norway or requested visits to
 investigate alleged violations. A small number of
 Norway's Lappish minority attempted to attract
 international attention, over the last year, to their
 protest against the government's plan to build a-dam
 and hydroelectric power plant along the Alta River in
 northern Norway. The Lapps claim that the
 construction of a dam will adversely affect, Inter
 alia, reindeer grazing, and hence the Lappish way of
 life. Lapp activists traveled to the Vatican to
 present a petition to the Pope and to the UN in an
 effort to publicize their cause. They also conducted
 sitdown and hunger strikes in Oslo. As a result of
 the protests, the government decided to delay
 construction of the dam while the ministry of culture
 did a study of the effects the dam would have on
 Lappish life and antiquities.
 Although there is little evidence to support Lappish
 charges of human rights violation, the issue has
 increased Norwegian awareness that the 20,000 Lapps,
 mostly concentrated in Norway's far north, have been
 discriminated against in a variety of ecbnomic,
 social, educational, and cultural ways. Such
 discrimination is subtle in its application and is in
 no way supported or condoned by official policy.
 There is a Norwegian chapter of Amnesty International.
 This group, along with many others including (but not
 limited to) parliamentary committees, individual
 politicians, religious groups, labor unions and other
 concerned citizens groups, takes an active interest
 in monitoring the progress of human rights abroad.

 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 The Norwegians enjoy a per capita GNP of
 approximately $13,800. At birth a Norwegian
 may expect to live to age 75. The infant mortality
 rate is 9 per 1,000 live births. Population grows at
 the average rate of 0.5 percent annually. All
 school-age children have access to free public
 education, and the nation is 99 percent literate.
 The Norwegian diet far exceeds nutritional
 requirements, and pure water is available to all.
 The benefits of the affluent economy are equitably
 distributed among all groups in society. Health care
 and education (largely financed by the public sector)
 are provided free or at a nominal cost to the
 individual.
 Women and Lapps are over-represented in lower income
 groups. However these groups have enjoyed
 above-average pay increases in recent years, due to
 the crafting of wage settlements to give lower income
 workers larger percentage increases. Such wage
 settlements, taken with a complex system of subsidies
 and progressive income taxes, reflect Norway's
 resolve to narrow the gap between the rich and the
 poor. In Norway this gap is already quite small
 compared to that of other societies.
 The government's efforts to ensure its citizens'
 vital needs can work at cross purposes with certain
 other human rights, however. Under Norwegian law,
 the spouse and the dependents of a foreigner working
 legally in Norway are entitled to join the worker,
 provided the worker has housing which health
 authorities regard as "socially responsible.*
 Foreign workers with large families sometimes find
 this standard an obstacle to family reunification,
 since reasonably priced housing is at a minimum in
 Norway's urban areas. Critics argue that the policy
 constitutes more of a problem for workers from less
 developed countries, while North American and West
 European workers do not feel its impact.
 Norwegians have the right to own property, but
 foreign nationals must apply through the ministry of
 agriculture to buy real estate.
 Local and national regulations permit the state to
 determine allowable prices for housing in the
 regulated housing market, which covers roughly 20
 percent of Norway's 1.3 million family dwellings.
