TAJIKISTAN
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Tajikistan’s new role in the global campaign against terrorism drew greater
international concern to the country and created opportunities for some important
human rights reforms. But it also strengthened President Emomali
Rakhmonov’s de facto single-party rule.While the government took some positive
steps in response to international pressure, it also kept the political opposition
under tight rein.Authorities partly used the pretext of the war against terrorism to
marginalize the northern province of Sugd and to increase control over peaceful
religious believers and leaders.
Restrictions on freedom of expression eased in August when authorities granted
operating licenses to three independent radio stations based in the capital,
Dushanbe: Asia-Plus, Asia FM, and Vatan. In June, the procuracy announced that
it would drop criminal charges—including public slander of the president and
sedition—against exiled Charogi Ruz (Light of Day) editor Dodojon Atovullo.
Authorities assured international organizations and Atovullo that he would be permitted
to return safely to Dushanbe and resume publication of his newspaper,
known for its unrelenting criticism of the Rakhmonov government.
Despite these changes, the majority of severe media restrictions remained firmly
in place. The sole state-owned publishing house in Dushanbe conducted pre-publication
censorship, authorities threatened and harassed journalists following publication
of material considered critical of government policy or influential
government figures, and cumbersome licensing procedures for media outlets continued
to be enforced. In September, state television Kuliab correspondent Suhrob
Farrukhshoev was fired after publishing a freelance article on the spread of typhoid
in Kuliab, President Rakhmonov’s home region. Television management told Farrukhshoev
that they were following orders issued to them by the Kuliab local
administration. Journalists also continued to practice consistent self-censorship,
sometimes to an extreme degree. The May 31 edition of the Russian-language
Biznes i Politika, for example, appeared with a blank space when two paragraphs
reportedly critical of the work of law enforcement agents were removed. Newspaper
employees explained that they themselves had expunged the paragraphs to
avoid potential problems with law enforcement.
On October 28, three journalists working for independent television stations
SM-1 and TRK-Asia in Khujand were forcibly conscripted by local military officials
after the airing of a program that claimed that the military employs gangs to fulfill
draft quotas. The journalists were Akram Azizov and Nasim Rahimov, SM-1
employees, and TRK-Asia collaborator Yusuf Yunusov.
Sugd province was a particular target of repression. The government, citing the
war against terrorism,persecuted its opponents, subjected religious leaders to more
intense surveillance, and handed down lengthy prison sentences to members of
Hizb ut-Tahrir, an organization that advocates re-establishment of the Islamic
Caliphate, or state, by peaceful means.
On June 11, former governor of Leninabad (now Sugd) province Abdujalil
Hamidov was sentenced, along with eighteen others, to fifteen years of imprisonment
during a closed trial on charges including embezzlement and attempted
assassination of Rakhmonov.The prosecution linked some of the defendants to the
Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), and the trial was the government’s latest
attempt to eliminate Hamidov’s family as a political force.Hamidov is a relative of
Abdumalik Abdullajonov, former prime minister of Tajikistan and former leader of
the northern-based opposition National Revival Movement (NRM). In exile since
the mid-1990s, Abdullajonov stands accused of masterminding an unsuccessful
1998 rebellion in Sugd; his brother, Abdugani, was unfairly convicted in 1999 on
charges of having participated in the 1998 rebellion, and another brother,
Abdulkhafiz Abdullaev, was sentenced to death in a closed 1998 trial for attempted
assassination of the president, and reportedly executed. Hamidov’s trial was conducted mostly in prison, international observers were denied access to it, and many
sources reported that, stricken with cancer,Hamidov had made a confession under
duress. Death sentences were passed on at least four of Hamidov’s co-defendants,
despite unclear charges surrounding their convictions.Diplomatic and other international
sources reported the death in detention of another of the nineteen defendants
during the trial, although official medical documentation of the cause of
death—allegedly cancer—was unavailable.
Following the lead of other Central Asian governments, Tajik officials in 2002
claimed that Hizb ut-Tahrir had previously been financed by al-Qaeda and the Taliban,
and they referred increasingly to the group as a major security threat.The government
maintained that a majority of Hizb ut-Tahrir members resided in Sugd,
where Tajikistan’s Uzbek minority is primarily based. Media and diplomatic
sources reported increased numbers of arrests of Hizb ut-Tahrir members compared
to previous years, with up to sixty arrests since the beginning of 2002. Local
monitors and journalists alleged that Hizb ut-Tahrir members had unfair trials and
were abused in detention. Trials produced sentences of up to eighteen years of
imprisonment.
More pressure was directed at Sugd in July, when during a visit there
Rakhmonov explicitly noted that three Tajik citizens detained by the United States
(U.S.) at Guantánamo Bay were Sugd residents. He subsequently criticized local
authorities for failing to curb the activities of “extremist” Islamic groups, including
the construction of unsanctioned mosques. He also accused the Islamic Renaissance
Party (IRP) of propagating “religious extremism.” Shortly afterwards, governmental
religious and Islamic councils were for the first time instructed to assess
Islamic leaders’ knowledge of Islam and of state religion laws. By October, the
authorities had shut down at least thirty-three of a reported 152 mosques in Isfara
district in Sugd, and had dismissed numerous imams allegedly on grounds of IRP
membership (the IRP enjoys significant support in Isfara district). Rakhmonov
further announced in July that the law on religion would be revised to require reregistration
of mosques.
Authorities took steps to identify and hold accountable perpetrators of political
killings, but resultant trials mostly led to death sentences. In May, eighty-two members
of the armed band of former United Tajik Opposition (UTO) field commander
Rakhmon Sanginov were brought to trial for murder, hostage taking,
banditry, and robbery. One of the group’s members, Rakhmatullo Tagoev, was on
July 22 sentenced to death during a closed court session. On March 27, four men
charged with the 2001 murder of Deputy Interior Minister Habib Sanginov were
sentenced to death, and three others to prison sentences ranging from sixteen to
twenty-five years.Human Rights Watch obtained eyewitness testimony of the torture
in detention and coerced confessions of three of those convicted, including
Kiomidin Mirzoev. In August, the Supreme Court sentenced to death Umedjon
Davlatov for the 1998 murders of local and international United Nations officials
and of Garm district chairman Sergei Davlatov in 2000; two co-defendants received
respectively sixteen and twenty years of imprisonment.
The government continued to deliver death sentences at an alarming rate, with
an average of at least five per month during the first half of 2002.Amnesty Internacrimitional
charged that death sentences were handed down in unfair and secret trials,
and executions often conducted in secrecy. Local and international organizations
gathered information on the consistent use of torture to extract testimony from
criminal suspects, in particular those charged with capital crimes.
The government maintained political control by obstructing the registration
and activities of opposition political parties,denying registration altogether, and by
refusing to register opposition election candidates. In October, the Democratic
Party of Tajikistan (DPT) announced a boycott of Sugd province by-elections after
the Central Electoral Commission denied an independent candidate, a member of
the DPT, registration on the grounds of faulty registration documents. The DPT
claimed that electoral commissions frequently registered only members of the
presidential People’s Democratic Party of Tajikistan (PDPT).When the PDPT candidate
received an overwhelming majority of the vote against the remaining IRP
candidate, the IRP rejected the results and accused local authorities of obstructing
its candidate’s campaign efforts. The newly-founded Unity Party of Tajikistan submitted
registration documents to the Ministry of Justice in April, but at this writing
was still not registered, and the Social Democratic Party also continued to be
denied registration, for a third year.
On a positive note, in July jurisdiction over penal institutions was transferred
from the Ministry of Internal Affairs to the Ministry of Justice. And in August, the
right to freedom of movement was enhanced when the government abolished the
exit visa requirement for travel abroad.
By September,more than 9,200 displaced Afghans who since late 2000 had been
living on the Pianj river islands on the border with Afghanistan were “returned” to
Afghanistan proper. They had endured harsh and sometimes life-threatening conditions
on the islands, after the Tajik government had denied them entry at the
frontier. Despite protests from the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) and diplomatic missions in Dushanbe, the Tajik authorities
forcibly repatriated nine Afghan men in August and September 2002.Eight of them
were deported on grounds of holding insufficient documentation.
In September, the Tajik government stated its intent to comply fully with its obligations
as a state party to the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty. Its noncompliance hitherto
involved failing to submit annual transparency reports and, most importantly,
acquiescing to the planting of antipersonnel mines inside Tajikistan by Russian
forces. Uzbek-laid antipersonnel mines continued to kill and injure civilians and
livestock in Tajikistan in 2002.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
In March, the government established a national Human Rights Commission,
headed by Deputy Prime Minister Saidamir Zuhurov, a former minister of security.
Zuhurov’s background raised doubts about whether the commission would provide
genuine human rights protection; in September, for example, Zuhurov
asserted that Hizb ut-Tahrir, targeted for severe repression throughout the region,
represented a greater threat to the country than external invasion.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
Tajikistan granted the use of airports in Dushanbe and Kuliab to the international
coalition against terrorism for military operations in Afghanistan; in
response, international aid—including to the military—grew, as did attention to
the country. The U.S. and France deployed troops to Dushanbe and to Kuliab airport,
while the United Kingdom, France, and Japan opened embassies.At the same
time, international attention to human rights problems lessened.When high-level
political leaders and donors made repeated visits to the country, they referred to
Tajikistan’s new political stability, but neglected to highlight torture and ongoing
political and religious persecution. This international policy only served to
embolden the government’s repression.
The European Commission (E.C.) Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth
of Independent States (TACIS) project resumed work in the country after a fouryear
suspension following the 1997 death of a European Union (E.U.) expatriate
employee in a hostage release operation. TACIS was to devote particular resources
to Tajikistan’s eventual ascension to the World Trade Organization.Taken together,
credits promised by the U.S., the E.U., the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development rose from U.S.$51 million
in 2001 to $322 million in 2002. Switzerland also tripled its aid to just under $9
million.
United Nations
The U.N. Office of Peace-Building (UNTOP) brought together government
officials, political parties, journalists, and others in political discussions in fiftyseven
districts and towns. The office’s human rights program included support for
national capacity building and human rights education, but human rights monitoring
continued to be excluded from the human rights officer’s brief. At the time
of writing,UNTOP was to begin police training programs. The office continued to
devote significant resources to attracting international aid for Tajikistan, including
for the reintegration of former combatants into civilian life.
In at least four cases during the year Tajikistan carried out death sentences
despite the U.N.Human Rights Committee having requested a stay of execution. In
addition to facilitating the return of more than 9,200 Afghan displaced persons to
Afghanistan, UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration facilitated
the voluntary repatriation of close to seven hundred Afghan refugees, and the
return of some 250 Tajik refugee students from Pakistan to Tajikistan
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) maintained
offices in Dushanbe, Khujand, Shaartuz, Dusti, Kurgan-Tiube, and Garm. Their
work throughout the year included human rights training for law enforcement personnel,
training on human rights monitoring, conferences on international criminal justice standards and discrimination against women, and a project on human
trafficking. The OSCE conducted limited trial monitoring of cases involving
torture.
United States
With U.S. troops deployed in Dushanbe and Kuliab in support of the counterterrorism
campaign, the U.S. consequently pledged long-term support, and provided
military and military-technical cooperation. On January 9, as a reward for
Tajikistan’s assistance in the war on terrorism, the U.S. State Department
announced the removal of arms sales restrictions imposed on Tajikistan in 1993.
The State Department said it would review requests to buy arms on a “case-by-case
basis.” Numerous high-level governmental officials paid visits to the country, but
avoided references to human rights violations in their public comments. The U.S.
appeared to minimize attention to human rights in Tajikistan, in contrast to other
Central Asian countries.The State Department’s Country Reports on Human Rights
Practices for 2001 gave a generally accurate account of the human rights situation,
however.
The U.S. delivered credits totaling a minimum of just over $29 million in food
aid and agricultural supplies, monies for infrastructure projects in Khatlon
province and the Rasht (formerly Garm) Valley.
International Financial Institutions
Following the delivery of aid tranches in 2001, the International Monetary Fund
in February rebuked Tajikistan for providing incorrect data to the fund on the
country’s external debt, but continued to hold discussions with the government to
increase its support to Tajikistan.The ADB gave U.S.$2.9 million for poverty reduction,
$5.3 million for earthquake disaster recovery, and $5 million for landslide
relief. In May, the E.C., in recognition of Tajikistan’s worst drought in seventy-five
years, gave Û10 million (U.S.$9.85 million) for drought assistance.
