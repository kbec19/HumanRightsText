 SZO TOMTE AND PRINCIPE*
 After some five centuries of colonial rule, Sao Tome and
 Principe was granted independence by the Portuguese in 1975.
 At that time, the Movement for the Liberation of Sao Tome
 and Principe (MLSTP), an already existing political party
 organized abroad, acceded to control of the government, and
 Manuel Pinto da Costa was elected president by the Popular
 Assembly, the supreme organ of the state and the highest
 legislative body. President da Costa was re-elected un-
 opposed in 1980 for a second five-year term. Sao Tome has
 been a one-party state since independence, and the creation,
 operation, and conduct of the organs of the state are based,
 according to the constitution, on the principles of popular
 revolutionary democracy, unity of power, and democratic
 centralism.
 Total population is estimated at 80,000, all of whose
 ancestors migrated to the islands after the year 1485 from
 various ethnic groups, including freed slaves. Over the
 years, Sao Tome has depended primarily on plantation agricul-
 ture with principal emphasis, beginning in the 19th century,
 on cacao and, to a lesser degree, coffee. The highest
 judicial authority is the Supreme Tribunal, whose members
 are proposed by the MLSTP and appointed by the National
 Popular Assembly, to which it is accountable.
 The constitution provides the basis for freedom of speech,
 thought, assembly, religion, and the freedom to demonstrate.
 These freed6ms are subject to conditions specified by law.
 The constitution also establishes that all citizens are
 equal before the law. It states that private property
 shall be protected subject to the economic policy of the
 state, guarantees the inviolability of the domicile and of
 correspondence, and provides for the right of universal
 suffrage and the right to work. It warns citizens not to
 abuse these rights, however, and asserts that the government
 will punish "rumors and all acts of destabilization against
 the security of the state, social stability, or law and
 order."
 Free political activity is limited by the nature of the
 one-party state, the government's control of the media, and
 the government's interpretation of destabilizing acts as
 cited in the constitution.
 1.    Respect for the Integrity of the Person, including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 It is not known whether there is a law which specifically
 prohibits torture. No reports have been received that
 torture is practiced.
 W-Tere is no United States Mission in Sao Tome and Principe
 and the United States has only limited information about
 the human rights situation there.
 
 
 210
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 No reports have been received of cruel or inhuman treatment.
 Prison conditions are not known. It is reported that former
 Prime Minister Trovoada, the major political prisoner, is
 allowed to receive visits from members of his family.
 c.   Disappearances
 No reports have been received indicating that secret
 arrests or clandestine detention by official or quasi-
 official security forces have occurred in the past two
 years.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Sao Tome's constitution prohibits arbitrary imprisonment.
 There is at least one known political prisoner, former Prime
 Minister Trovoada. There may be others whose existence has
 not been reported. In July 1980, some 20 prisoners were
 released, including at least one political prisoner detained
 since 1979.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitution states that 'a citizen may be arrested,
 imprisoned, or convicted only under the law in force at
 the time the alleged act was committed. The right to defense
 counsel shall be granted to any defendant or accused person."
 The constitution does not speak of the right of public trial
 although it is believed the right is observed in practice.
 No charges have been made public against former Prime
 Minister Trovoada, who has been held since October 1979.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 According to limited available information, invasion of
 the home does not occur. In the Trovoada case, however, the
 offices of the United Nations Development Program were
 invaded,and he was removed by uniformed police personnel.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care, and
 Education
 The economy of Sao Tome and Principe is based on plantation
 agriculture producing cash crops (especially cocoa) for
 export. The state's management of the former Portuguese-
 owned plantations is designed to respond directly to the
 needs of those who work on them.
 Per capita Gross Domestic Product is estimated at $275.
 Three-fifths of the population, roughly 15,000 members of
 the labor force, are in agriculture, fisheries, and forestry.
 The Government of Sao Tome and Principe (GSTP) has set goals
 of increasing production of export crops and reducing the
 country's dependence on imported food. In order to reach
 these goals, it must overcome shortages of manpower, of
 capital for investment in plants and equipment for the
 plantations, and of chemical products, such as fertilizers
 and pesticides. In order to increase the general level of
 training in the labor force, the government is olacing an increased
 emphasis in the educational system on the skills needed for
 agriculture.

 Wages and prices are controlled. The mimimum wage was
 raised by 11 percent in early 1980, after four years without
 change, and now stands at roughly $2.60 per day. Reflecting
 the government emphasis on agriculture, the minimum agri-
 cultural wage is now roughly 11 percent higher than the
 lowest salary on the civil service scale.  The prices of
 all basic consumer goods are controlled, with most foreign
 goods being sold through a state-run marketing organization.
 Given authorized rises in prices, inflation in 1979 is
 estimated to have been 5.5 percent, down from roughly 10
 percent in 1978.
 Capital expenditures for development and social welfare
 purposes increased in 1979 and are budgeted to rise again in
 1980. Combined with a drop in foreign assistance, this led
 to an increase in the central budget deficit. Budgets in
 the first years after independence concentrated on expenses
 for the central administration and health and education.
 In 1979, the pattern began to shift towards expenditures on
 agriculture, which now represents almost 70 percent of
 capital expenditures. Basic education and primary school
 facilities are being expanded in the effort to reduce
 illiteracy. Malaria eradication and pre-and post-natal
 clinics are emphasized in capital expenditures for health.
 The government also has seeks a growth in the overall
 level of employment and a reduction in the inequalities of
 income distribution. It hopes to have~a nine percent
 increase in overall employment in the public sector. Recent
 estimates of'population growth indicate that it exceeds 2.5
 percent.
 3.    Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:    I
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution guarantees the basic freedoms of religion
 and assembly, but political expression and participation are
 limited because the country has only one political party.
 The press is government-controlled. Assembly for political
 purposes must have the sanction of the ruling party. Women
 enjoy constitutional guarantees of equality with men; many
 are active in public life and several have attained minister-
 ial rank. All labor organizations are affiliated with Sao
 Tome and Principe's single political party and do not play
 an independent role in the political process. Information
 about strike action is not available.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The requirement of exit visas and the physical isolation of
 the islands are the only known barriers to movement out of
 the country, including emigration. There are no known
 controls on internal travel. Public statements by government
 leaders indicate recognition of the right of repatriation
 (see III,c, below). The government's respect of the right
 of asylum is called into question by the Trovoada case.
 There is no refugee program in Sao Tome and Principe.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 All political activity is controlled by the Movement for the
 Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe (MLSTP), the country's
 
 
 212
 single party, which was established in the late 1950's.
 Following the overthrow of the Caetano government in Lisbon
 in 1974 and the decision to dissolve its colonial regime,
 Sao Tome acquired independence and the MLSTP assumed power
 on July 12, 1975. A new constitution was adopted in November
 of the same year, designating the Popular Assembly as the
 supreme organ of the state, charged Inter alia with the
 election of the president. Legislators themselves are
 elected by district popular assemblies for a period of five
 years. The popular assemblies, in turn, are elected by the
 people for a term of two and one-half years. The first
 post-independence assembly elections took place in 1980.
 There is no known discrimination within the party by reason
 of sex, race, religion, language, or social class. Former
 members of the now-disbanded opposition groups who remain in
 the country appear to suffer no prejudicial treatment at
 the hands of the government. Several political opponents of
 the government are in exile, but President da Costa has
 announced that exiles are free to return whenever they
 wish.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding international
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no local organizations which systematically report
 and contest human rights violations. Amnesty International
 has expressed concern about the Trovoada case and states
 that, despite repeated inquiries, it has received no details
 regarding his detention or possible trial.
