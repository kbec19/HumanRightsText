 PAPUA NEW GUINEA
 Papua New Guinea is the largest independent (since 1975)
 island country in the South Pacific. It is also the most
 diverse with over 700 languages, and local affiliations are
 often far stronger than allegiances to the national govern-
 ment. Papua New Guinea is a parliamentary democracy, with
 a unicameral legislature. Significant powers are delegated
 by the central government to provincial governments which
 are popularly elected. The diverse nature of the population
 and the rapid change in transition from a traditional to a
 modern way of life have presented many challenges to national
 unity. This has, at times, made the extension of government
 to all sectors of the country difficult. Despite these
 pressures, Papua New Guinea has created democratic institu-
 tions and has demonstrated genuine concern for human rights.
 The constitution, a long and comprehensive document, enumer-
 ates an extensive list of personal freedoms, all of which
 are guaranteed and protected. In practice, Papua New Guinea
 has an excellent record of observing and protecting human
 rights. There is a strong commitment to abide by the
 numerous human rights guarantees provided in the constitution.
 Complaints of abuse are rare, and openly and quickly
 investigated.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There is no torture in Papua New Guinea. It is prohibited
 by law (Section 36 of the constitution) and custom.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is
 illegal, and not practiced or condoned. There are no
 executions of any kind in Papua New Guinea. Treatment of
 prisoners if fair and humane. Prison conditions are
 generally good. Most are minimum security facilities.
 There are abuses, but prisoners have the right to complain
 to the Ombudsman Commission with the confidentiality of
 their correspndence guaranteed. Public defenders are
 available. The Papua New Guinea Red Cross has access to
 detainees.
 c. Disappearances
 There are no "disappeared" person in Papua New Guinea.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There are no political prisoners in Papua New Guinea. Habeas
 corpus exists and is honored in practice. Preventive
 detention does not occur. Wrongful arrest is prohibited in
 the constitution (section 58 and 59) and the Arrest Act
 provides a remedy. The time period between arrest and trial
 is generally under 90 days. Accused persons are allowed
 visitors.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair hearing and a fair trial is guaranteed
 by law. Trials are open to the public. Defendants are
 entitled to counsel, and counsels have free access to
 defendents. Consultations between counsel and defendant may
 
 
 674
 
 be held in private. There is no harassment of defense
 counsels by the government. Defendants are quickly made aware
 in court of the charges brought against them, and they and
 their lawyers can inform themselves of the evidence on which
 charges are based.
 Papua New Guinea's courts are independent of executive or
 military control. In 1980, the first Papua New Guinean was
 appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.  (Previously
 the Chief Justiceship has been held by foreigners.)
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Constitution Section 44 ensures sanctity of the home, and
 the Search Act requires a warrant. Courts issue warrants.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 As a developing, newly independent nation, Papua New Guinea
 lacks much of the social welfare infrastructure required to
 meet the basic needs for food, shelter, health care and
 education. Starvation is virtually nonexistent. Papua New
 Guinea has set national priorities focused on basic needs
 and is directing government revenues and foreign assistance
 to these clearly defined goals. There is a strong emphasis
 on rural development and on reducing urban migration. There
 is a strong commitment to the attraction of foreign invest-
 ment. Statistics such as per capita gross national product
 are not meaningful indicators in a country with only 5-6
 percent of the population in the salaried workforce. The
 government is committed to provide adequate shelter, health
 care and education to the extent that its limited resources
 can bear. Its economic development program is designed to
 stimulate economic activities that provide revenues to allow
 the government to provide for these needs. Corruption does
 not significantly affect government programs directed at
 fulfilling human needs. The nutrition program is an example
 of government efforts in the field of diet and food, an& by
 1979, every province had a functioning nutrition program.
 The National Planning Office now has a nutrition planner.
 The Department of Primary Industry has appointed a number of
 officers to do nutrition extension work. The Nutrition Pro-
 gram of the College of Allied Health Sciences has continued
 to grow.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These rights are protected by law. There is a free press
 with two independent newspaper companies. There is only one
 radio station and it is government-owned. It appears un-
 fettered in news reporting and often carries news items un-
 favorable to the government. Australian radio stations can
 easily be picked up on the medium wave broadcast band,
 particularly during evening hours. There is no television
 in Papua New Guinea. The labor movement includin4 public
 service employees is free to strike and has exercised that
 right. Freedom of religion is guaranteedand most major
 Western religious groups have strong adherents here.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Papua New Guineans are free to travel within the country and
 abroad. Passport fees are not excessive. There are few
 
 
 675
 refugees in Papua New Guinea. those refugees that exist
 come principally from the neighboring Indonesian province
 of West Irian. Available information does not reveal any
 governmental restrictions on the right to repatriate to
 Papua New Guinea.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Papua New Guinea's political processes are free and open.
 Elections are fair, party affiliations are less important
 than traditional affiliations, and ideological positions
 are not sharply drawn between parties. The change in
 government in 1980, the first since independence in 1975,
 was orderly and peaceful.
 Although women play a role in the political arena, because
 of traditional social factors they are not yet fully inte-
 grated into the nation's political process. As a matter of
 law, discrimination based on sex is not permissible: nor are
 there restrictions against women participaing in the
 political process. Three of the 109 members of parliament
 are women. One woman is the leader of a political party.
 Until March, 1980, a woman served as Minister of Justice.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding international
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no allegations of violations of human rights
 by the Papua New Guinea government by international or non-
 governmental agencies. Papua New Guineas has not acceded
 to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
