 PERU
 The most significant human rights development in Peru
 over the past year has been the continued progress
 toward the return to democratic government. An assembly
 to write a new national constitution, chosen in June
 1978 in the country's first national elections in 15
 years, completed its work last July. The new Constitution,
 which takes effect in July 1980, incorporates many
 of the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human
 Rights. Peru's military Government, which has been
 in power 11 years, announced that national elections
 will be held on May 18, 1980, and the elected Government
 installed on July 28. The Government has promised
 a free and open campaign. A large number of political
 parties representing a broad spectrum of views are
 registering for the contest.
 Progress toward democracy took place against a backdrop
 of continued social strain and labor unrest as the
 country struggled to overcome.its worst economic crisis
 in decades. Nonitheless, the Government generally
 upheld the basic principles of human rights which have
 increasingly characterized its policies in recent years.
 Instances of government brutality have been rare, and
 Peruvians can in most instances look to the law for
 protection against arbitrary treatment. The judicial
 process is very slow and conditions in most prisons
 are poor. In recognition of these problems and of
 the need to assure judicial independence, the new Constitution
 contains a commitment to increased funding for the
 judiciary.
 The 1933 and 1979 Constitutions permit the Executive,
 when necessary for security reasons, to declare a state
 of emergency and suspend the constitutional guarantees
 of habeas corpus, inviolability of the home, peaceful
 assembly, freedom of movement, and freedom from banishment
 or deportation.
 The concept of equality is gradually being strengthened
 in a society in which the opportunity for a better
 life has long been denied to the large number of Indians
 and other disadvantaged rural poor. Major problems
 remain: poverty, illiteracy, unemployment and underemployment,
 and inadequate participation in national life by the
 millions who live from subsistence agriculture in the
 highlands. Peru's military Government, which took
 power in 1968, proclaimed the need for a revolution
 to end these ancient pr.oblems, remedy social injustice,
 and assure the country's freedom from foreign domination.
 The Government's program led to the expropriation of
 large land holdings and certain extractive and basic
 industries, the formation of agricultural cooperatives,
 the introduction of the concept of worker participation
 in the ownership and management of large enterprises,
 and a substantial expansion of education services.
 Subsidies for food products and other basic human needs
 were a fundamental feature of this program. The military
 Government restricted civil and political rights, dissolved
 the Congress, ruled by decree, reduced the independence
 of the judiciary and, in 1974, took control of the
 
 (391)
 
 
 daily press, television and radio. The country encountered
 severe economic and financial difficulties beginning
 in the mid-1970s. The Government, with the support
 of an International Monetary Fund standby loan, imposed
 a stabilization program in 1978, which it has continued,
 after abandoning similar programs in 1976 and 1977.
 The program has resulted in considerable improvement
 in Peru's external accounts. However, inflation continued
 at an annual rate of around 70% during 1979. Unemployment
 is estimated at 8% overall, but over 12% for non-agricultural
 workers. Underemployment is also high.   After declines
 in aggregate economic output in 1977 and 1978, the
 Peruvian Central Bank expects a growth in real gross
 domestic product of 1.6% in 1979.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 There is no evidence that Government officials condone
 torture or similar abuses against the individual.
 (The 1979 Constitution provides that any prisoner may
 ask for a court order for an immediate examination
 by a physician of his or her choice to determine if
 the prisoner has been physically abused.) The penal
 code provides for punishment of Government officials
 guilty of physically abusing a prisoner. In late 1978,
 six policemen were charged in court with torturing
 and killing a militant student leader. This trial,
 which press reports claim is the first of its kind
 in Peruvian history, resulted, in August 1979, in two-
 year prison sentences for three of the policemen and
 acquittal for the others. Since the prosecutor had
 asked for four-year sentences, he has appealed the
 decision to the Supreme Court. The leftist weeklies
 "La Calle" and "Equis" charged in May and June 1979
 that police tortured a bank worker and several students.
 Police denied both charges, formal charges were not
 brought before a court, and there were no further press
 reports of these alleged acts of torture.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment by police
 and prison authorities is illegal, but does occur occasion-
 ally despite official efforts to curb abuse. Peruvian
 penal facilities are generally primitive, dirty and
 overcrowded and, therefore, prolonged imprisonment
 could itself be considered inhuman or degrading. (The
 1979 Constitution provides that prisoners have the
 right to be held in healthful and adequate penal facilities).
 The International Committee of the Red Cross has full
 access to prisoners. In late 1979 a contingent of
 the Guardia Republicana, approximately 450 strong,
 entered Lurigancho Prison to conduct a massive search.
 The operation was apparently based on reports of a
 large-scale escape plot. During the course of approximately
 
 
 393
 three hours the Guardia employed violence, injuring
 many prisoners. A judge ordered that four Guardia
 officers be held for trial for their involvement in
 the violence. On this and a few other occasions when
 Americans have been physically abused during detention
 or interrogation, the United States Government has
 protested vigorously and has received assurances that
 such treatment is not condoned.
 According to Amnesty International, government forces
 killed three persons and wounded at least 12 others
 during a land tenure dispute in Cajamarca province
 in December 1978. Amnesty also reported that one person
 was killed and 20 people were injured when government
 forces evicted members of peasant cooperatives in two
 communities in Alto Piura province in February 1979.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 During the year a few dozen labor leaders and six Marxist
 politicians were detained temporarily without due process
 during periods of labor strife and/or states of emergency
 declared during the past year. These instances occurred
 in conjunction with general strikes in January and
 July, a miners' strike in March, and a teachers' strike
 June through September. Amnesty International reported
 in August 1979 that 1,700 persons had been detained
 during the teachers' strike. Most detainees were freed
 quickly. The Government late in 1979 released those
 persons still detained in connection with the teachers'
 and other strikes. The Interior Minister stated that
 no political prisoners were held nor are any Peruvians
 deported. The 1933 Constitution and the 1979 Constitution
 guarantee protection against arbitrary arrest, but
 the right of habeas corpus has been suspended during
 most of 1979 under the emergency provisions of the
 1933 Constitution.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There is no evidence that the Government violates,
 as a matter of policy, the guarantee of a fair public
 trial for those accused of crimes. However, the overbur-
 dened but independent legal system is beset with delays
 and, according to legal authorities and the press,
 some of the underpaid and overworked judges and other
 judicial officials have been guilty of corruption.
 Theoretically, free legal assistance is available to
 those unable to pay, but this system often fails to
 function in practice. Thus, the poorest and the socially
 disadvantaged have less than full access to the judicial
 system.
 The Peruvian system, in the tradition of the Napoleonic
 Code, calls for written rather than oral presentations.
 Poorly-educated defendants, especially those who speak
 only Quechua, Aymara, or other indigenous languages,
 can thus find themselves at a disadvantage in proceedings
 which they do not adequately understand.
 The 1979 Constitution provides that the judiciary will
 receive a minimum of 2 percent of the national budget,
 
 
 which would be a substantial increase above the current
 level.
 Capital punishment is rarely used. In January 1979
 a Peruvian Air Force sergeant, convicted of spying
 for Chile, was executed under the Peruvian Code of
 Military Justice after review of the case by the Supreme
 Military Tribunal. Summary executions are nonexistent.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 The 1933 and 1979 Constitutions guarantee the inviolability
 of the home except duting a state of emergency, when
 police are permitted to enter and search homes and
 seize suspects and property without a judicial warrant.
 Such entries and searches occasionally occurred during
 the above-mentioned strikes.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The 1979 Constitution guarantees the provision of these
 vital needs. The reforms instituted by the military
 Government redistributed social and economic power
 in both urban and rural areas. Particularly during
 the earlier years of military administration, industrial
 workers realized substantial gains in real income.
 A strong historic commitment to educational opportunity
 along with recent reforms in the administration and
 content of educational programs benefitted children
 of low-to-middle income families throughout the country.
 About 85 percent of school-age children now have access
 to basic education.
 Government efforts to improve conditions in Peru's
 urban slums have included measures giving juridical
 and administrative structure to slum communities, provi-
 sion of basic services, and recognition of urban squatters'
 title to the land. Despite these achievements, the
 rural majority and a very sizable minority of urban
 inhabitants remain ill-fed, badly-housed and inadequately
 served in health and education.
 Government efforts to deal with basic needs have been
 hampered by a stagnant economy and budgetary restrictions
 as unprofitable state enterprises, defense expenditures
 and slowly-maturing investment projects have claimed
 a large share of national resources. The stabilization
 program begun in 1978 has strengthened Peru's international
 financial position and is intended to lead to a better
 investment climate and a more productive economy, but
 has not yet had time to produce visible improvement
 in terms of basic human needs. Real wages declined
 for all categories of workers during the period 1976-
 
 
 395
 78; unemployment, underemployment and inflation increased
 substantially, and nutritional levels declined among
 the poor, according to a recent U.S. Agency for International
 Development report. In 1979, real income for blue
 collar workers rose slightly. Real income for white
 collar workers declined, but at a slower rate than
 in the previous two years.
 Left- and right-wing newspapers and magazines have
 charged that corruption in Government and Government
 contracting has siphoned off funds which otherwise
 would have been available for development and welfare.
 These charges have not been substantiated. A special
 committee of the Constituent Assembly established to
 investigate "illegal enrichment" did not make any charges
 but referred the results of its hearings to the new
 Congress which will take office in July 1980.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Independent magazines and nondaily newspapers have
 enjoyed substantial freedom of expression. Many have
 frequently and strongly criticized the Government and
 Armed Forces. However, 10 non-dailies were closed
 from January through May 1979 in response to articles
 touching on national security matters, and attacking
 the military. Those which remained open and several
 which began publishing during that period continued
 to criticize the Government. In addition, various
 provincial newspapers and radio stations were closed
 during times of local unrest.
 National circulation daily newspapers, radio and television
 are under direct Government control. The Government's
 central information office controls the content of
 political TV programming and occasionally bars programs
 because of criticism of the Government. In September
 1979, most political programs were limited to broadcasts
 after 10:00 P.M. In July 1978, the Government issued
 a press law which opened the possibility of the return
 to the private sector of Government-controlled daily
 newspapers. In September 1979, President Morales Bermudez
 promised that the dailies would be returned to their
 owners, but that newspaper workers would have an important
 role in their management.
 The November 1978 revision of the Code of Military
 Justice, making civilians liable to prosecution before
 military courts for criticism of military institutions,
 was nullified by an August 1979 decree-law. However,
 the new decree-law also modified the penal code provisions
 for defamation and libel, stiffening the penalties
 for all categories of offenders and imposing heavier
 penalties for libel and defamation against public persons
 and entities.
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of conscience and
 religion, and there have been no instances of persecution
 for religious beliefs in recent times. Freedom of
 
 
 396
 assembly is also guaranteed by the Constitution although,
 as previously noted, that right has been suspended
 under the state of emergency provision during periods
 of civil or labor unrest. During the June-September
 1979 teachers' strike, the Government broke up some
 peaceful assemblies without invoking the state of emergency.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 The 1933 and 1979 Constitutions guarantee the right
 of free movement. There are no political or legal
 restraints on foreign travel or emigration. During
 the current period of austerity the Government has
 imposed heavy travel and passport fees to discourage -
 international travel, but accompanying limits on foreign
 exchange.expenditures were recently liberalized as
 a result of the improved foreign exchange situation.
 Internally, the movement of mine workers was restricted
 for several weeks in five departments in central and
 southern Peru under state of emergency provisions during
 periods of labor unrest in March of 1979.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Universal suffrage for all Peruvians 18 years of age
 and older is provided in the 1979 Constitution.
 The Constituent Assembly elected in 1978 freely carried
 out its deliberations in drafting and approving a new
 Constitution. A few members of the Constituent Assembly
 were briefly detained in connection with their involvement
 in the miners' strike in March 1979, but, in keeping
 with their parliamentary immunity, they were released
 to the custody of the Constituent Assembly which thereupon
 determined that they had been improperly detained.
 The Government has not interfered with political party
 campaign activities for the 1980 election, although
 some parties contend that the Government-controlled
 media have not accorded them equitable coverage.
 Workers in the private sector enjoy the right to unionize
 as a result of interpretations of, and governmental
 decrees founded on, provisions of the 1933 Constitution
 guaranteeing free association. Although this right
 does not officially extend to public sector workers,
 in practice unionization of civil servants is also
 permitted. The right to strike is not guaranteed by
 the 1933 Constitution (the 1979 Constitution guarantees
 this right), but a series of laws, executive decrees
 and ministerial resolutions over the last five decades
 has had the practical effect of assuring this right
 to private sector unions. However, its free exercise
 is suspended during a state of emergency.
 There were two general strike attempts, one in January
 1979 and one in July, neither of which had much impact.
 There was also a major mine strike in March. However,
 the most significant labor problem of the year was
 a four month teachers' strike from June through September.
 Violence surrounding the strike resulted in the death
 of five persons and many injuries and arrests. A large
 
 
 397
 number of demonstrators were detained, but most were
 .released within a few days.
 The 1933 and 1979 Constitutions guarantee the right
 of women to participate in the political process, and
 the 1979 Constitution also guarantees equality in employment.
 A few women occupy prominent positions in the public
 and private sectors. Two women were members of the
 100-member Constituent Assembly; others hold judicial
 and other public offices at the provincial and municipal
 levels. Less change is evident among the poor, however,
 where most women have remained in traditional roles.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There have been no requests to the Government for international
 investigation of alleged human rights abuse.
 Peru has consistently supported efforts by the Organization
 of American States to strengthen inter-American human
 rights activities, and has nominated respected human
 rights advocates to such bodiet as the Inter-American
 Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American Human
 Rights Court. A-Peruvian was elected Vice-President
 of the Court. Another respected Peruvian human rights
 advocate is a member of the committee of experts of
 the United Nations Human Rights Commission.
 Peru ratified the American Convention on Human Rights
 in July 1978 and the United Nations Covenants on Civil
 and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural
 Rights in April 1978, but has not yet ratified the
 Optional Protocol of the Covenant on Civil and Political
 Rights. The new Peruvian Constitution draws heavily
 upon the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and
 the two Covenants. Peru has historically been committed
 to the principle of strict non-intervention in the
 internal affairs of other states but supports multinational
 human rights institutions and machinery.
