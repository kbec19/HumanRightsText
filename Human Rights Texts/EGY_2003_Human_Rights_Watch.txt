EGYPT
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
The government intensified its crackdown on real or suspected political opponents,
tightened its control over civil society institutions, and clamped down on
freedom of speech and expression. Thousands of political suspects remained in
prolonged detention without trial under emergency legislation in force almost continuously
since 1967, and there were a series of grossly unfair trials before military
or state security courts in which defendants had no right of appeal to higher tribunals.
The torture and ill-treatment of political detainees remained common, and
the government continued to impose the death penalty.
The authorities carried out hundreds of arrests during 2002 of suspected government
opponents, targeting principally alleged members of banned Islamist
groups. The arrests were widely perceived as part of a wider crackdown on groups
espousing Islamist ideologies in the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks in New
York and Washington, D.C. Minister of Interior Habib al-‘Adli told journalists in
February: “There should be a clear distinction made between human rights and
crimes. I have no mercy for criminals who give themselves the right to threaten the
nation’s well-being.”Many of those arrested were held under emergency legislation,
in some cases allegedly tortured, and subsequently either released without charge
or referred to trial before special courts that failed to meet international fair trial
standards.
A small number of those arrested allegedly belonged to Talae’ al-Fatah (Vanguards of the Conquest), a banned Islamist group believed to be an offshoot of al-
Gihad al-Islami (Islamic Gihad). The vast majority of the Islamists targeted, however,
were alleged members of the banned al-Ikhwan al-Muslimun (Muslim
Brotherhood), scores of whom were arrested in several operations carried out by
state security personnel. Eight prominent members of the group were arrested on
January 25 after allegedly participating in a secret meeting in the al-‘Agouza district
of Cairo.They included several university professors and doctors as well as an engineer.
They were detained for fifteen days pending further investigation. A further
twenty-eight people reportedly linked to the Muslim Brotherhood were arrested on
July 12 in Cairo and elsewhere.They were charged with planning to stage a demonstration
“allegedly to support the Palestinian cause and to criticize the government’s
policy in handling that issue,” according to Interior Ministry officials. They
were detained for fifteen days pending investigation. On July 21, thirty-four other
alleged Muslim Brotherhood members were also held for fifteen days pending
investigation.They were arrested the previous day near Cairo and accused of membership
of an illegal organization, possessing literature promoting the group’s ideology,
and harming national unity. Among them were students, university
lecturers, doctors, engineers and other professionals. It was not known how many
of them remained in detention at this writing.
Violent clashes erupted in Alexandria on June 28 during parliamentary by-elections,
as security and police personnel reportedly prevented Muslim Brotherhood
supporters from reaching the polling stations to cast their votes. The two seats in
the al-Raml constituency being contested had remained unfilled after the 2000 parliamentary
elections. In the first round of the 2000 election, two Muslim Brotherhood
candidates had defeated candidates representing the ruling National
Democratic Party (NDP); the Ministry of Interior then annulled the results, stating
that voting had been marred by irregularities.The election went ahead in June 2002
following an administrative court ruling and NDP candidates achieved a landslide
victory. Some 150 Muslim Brotherhood supporters were arrested during the election-
related clashes. Many of them were released shortly thereafter, but 101 were
charged and brought to trial.
Scores of demonstrators were also arrested following protests against Israeli and
U.S. government policies toward the Palestinians. On April 9, several thousand
demonstrators,many of them university students, held a demonstration in Alexandria
to coincide with the visit to Egypt of U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell.
Clashes broke out between the demonstrators and riot police,who reportedly used
tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowds. One demonstrator was killed in
the clashes, allegedly after riot police used shotgun pellets, and scores of others were
injured. Some seventy student demonstrators were arrested and held under emergency
legislation for up to ten days, accused of damaging public property and illegal
assembly. They were later released without charge. In mid-May, several activists
affiliated with the Egyptian Popular Committee for Solidarity with the Palestinian
Intifada were also arrested in Cairo’s Tahrir Square. They were reportedly distributing
lists of U.S. goods and products and urging members of the public to boycott
them. The authorities accused them of disrupting public order and held them for
one day before releasing them without charge.
The government continued to refer civilian political suspects to military courts,
the vast majority of them on charges of membership in banned Islamist groups and
related offences. The trial of twenty-two people accused of membership in the
Muslim Brotherhood opened before the Supreme Military Court in Haikstep on
December 24, 2001.Most of the defendants were university professors, engineers,
doctors, and businessmen, arrested the previous month after staging peaceful
protests against U.S. military strikes in Afghanistan. The charges against them
included attempting to recruit members to the Muslim Brotherhood and inciting
the public against the government. On July 30, the court sentenced sixteen defendants
to prison terms of between three and five years and acquitted the remaining
six. In a statement issued after the verdict, the Muslim Brotherhood accused the
government of targeting its members as part of a crackdown on Islamists carried
out under U.S. pressure. In a separate case, noted above, 101 alleged Muslim Brotherhood
members and supporters were brought before the state security court in
Alexandria between September 2-4, charged with illegal assembly, rioting, assaulting
police personnel, and obstructing voting following violent clashes with police
and security forces during parliamentary by-elections in the city. On October 22,
sixty-six of the defendants received three-month prison terms but were released
since they had already served the time; the remainder were acquitted.
Fifty-one alleged members of a previously unknown Islamist group, Tanzim al-
Wa’d (Organization of Promise),were convicted by the Supreme Military Court on
September 9 following a trial that began in December 2001. They were among
ninety-four defendants arrested principally in May 2001, initially accused of illegally
collecting funds for Chechen separatists and the Palestinian group Hamas,
and held for several months without trial. In October 2001, the authorities
announced that the defendants would be referred to trial and charged additionally
with plotting to assassinate senior government officials,Muslim and Christian religious
figures, writers, and others, and plotting to organize military training for
their members in Chechnya with the intention of perpetrating terrorist acts in
Egypt. The defendants included several foreign nationals, among them three Russian
nationals from Dagestan, while the Egyptian defendants included two prominent
mosque preachers and two others who had received flight training in the U.S.
Initially, seven of them were tried in absentia, but the trial was extended following
the extradition of one of the suspects from Azerbaijan in April. Those convicted
received prison terms ranging between two and fifteen years, and the remaining
forty-three were acquitted.During the trial, a number of defendants said that they
had been tortured under interrogation.They had no right of appeal before a higher
tribunal and could only appeal for a review before the Military Appeals Bureau.
On October 20, the trial of twenty-six defendants charged with membership in
the banned Hizb al-Tahrir al-Islami (Islamic Liberation Party) opened before an
Emergency Supreme State Security Court in Cairo. The defendants were among
scores of suspects arrested in early April in Cairo, Giza, and Alexandria governorates,
accused of belonging to a banned group aiming to “obstruct the legal system
and to undermine state institutions” and to establish an Islamic caliphate. The
majority was released following several weeks of incommunicado detention. The
twenty-six referred to trial, among them three Britons—Ian Nisbett,Majid Nawaz, and Reza Pankhurst—also faced additional charges of attempting to recruit new
members to the Islamic Liberation Party and possession of anti-government literature.
During the opening session of the trial, some of the defendants stated that
they had been tortured during interrogation to obtain confessions from them,
including through beating and electric shocks. The trial was ongoing by late
November. If convicted, the defendants faced maximum prison terms of fifteen
years and had no right of appeal to a higher tribunal.
Police and security personnel continued to routinely torture or mistreat
detainees, in some cases leading to death in custody. A number of political suspects
on trial before military or state security courts during 2002 on charges of membership
in banned political groups and related offenses alleged that they had been tortured
during interrogation while in the custody of State Security Intelligence (SSI).
(See below.) Ordinary criminal suspects held in police custody also stated that they
had been tortured to extract confessions from them.At least five deaths in custody
were reported in 2002.According to the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights
(EOHR),at least twelve detainees died under torture at police stations between January
2001 and June 2002. In a report released in May, the EOHR detailed eleven
other cases of torture at the hands of the police during the same period.
In a positive development, the authorities referred a number of police personnel
accused of torturing and causing the death of suspects in their custody to trial
in four separate cases in 2002. For example, the Cairo Criminal Court on July 14
sentenced three police officers to five-year prison terms in connection with the case
of Ahmad Taha Yusuf, who died in February after being tortured at Wayley police
station in the city. On August 8, a Cairo Criminal Court sentenced two police officers
to three-year prison terms each in connection with the death of Sayed Khalifa
‘Isa, arrested on suspicion of car theft on January 26. He died in early March after
being repeatedly beaten and reportedly subjected to electric shocks at a police station
in Madinat Nasr.
Authorities did not investigate the vast majority of allegations of torture, however,
and new cases continued to be reported. In November, two local NGOs
reported the deaths in custody in July of Nabih Muhammad al-Shahin and his
cousin Muhammad Muhammad ‘Abdul-Fattah, who were reportedly tortured at
Zefta police station and Wadi Natrun prison. They were arrested in June in connection
with a street fight. It was not known whether the authorities had opened a
criminal investigation into their deaths.
Egypt’s Child Law gave police broad powers to arrest children found begging,
homeless, or skipping school, and police regularly detained these children for days
without food and bedding in cells with adult criminal suspects and subjected them
to beatings and sexual abuse and violence.
Egyptian courts sentenced at least fifty-eight people to death and the authorities
carried out nineteen executions between November 2001 and November 2002,
according to Amnesty International. All the sentences were imposed for ordinary
criminal offenses, including murder, rape, and drug trafficking.
On June 10, a state security court in Alexandria sentenced Magdi Anwar Tawfiq
to ten years in prison with hard labor after convicting him of spying for Israel’s
intelligence agency,Mossad.He had been arrested in September 2001 and accused of communicating with the Israeli consulate in the city, allegedly with the intent of
offering information related to Egypt’s political and economic interests, and his
trial opened on May 11. He had no right of appeal to a higher tribunal. In a separate
espionage case, Sherif al-Filali, also charged with spying for Mossad, was convicted
by the Emergency Supreme State Security Court in Cairo and sentenced to
fifteen years’imprisonment in late March.He had no right of appeal to a higher tribunal.
The court had previously acquitted Al-Filali of the charge in a first trial in
2001, but a re-trial was ordered in accordance with emergency laws after President
Mubarak’s office refused to endorse the verdict. (See Human Rights Watch World
Report 2002.) His co-defendant, a Russian army officer, was sentenced in absentia
to twenty-five years in prison.
The government continued to prosecute individuals for their exercise of freedom
of expression. A Cairo misdemeanors court sentenced Shohdy Surur, a web
designer for the English language newspaper Al-Ahram Weekly, to a one-year
prison term on June 30 after he was found guilty under Egypt’s publication laws of
violating “public morality.” He was arrested in November 2001 after he posted a
poem on the Internet written by his late father, Naguib Surur, in the early 1970s.
The poem, political in nature, was said by the prosecution to be sexually explicit.
Shohdy Surur was released on bail pending appeal, but on October 14 the appeals
court upheld the sentence, since, according to Egyptian law, Surur was required to
be present at the hearing. Surur was abroad at the time, and had not returned to
Egypt by late November.
The government also prosecuted individuals for exercising their right to freedom
of conscience and religion. On September 28, a Cairo state security court sentenced
Sayed Tolba Abu ‘Ali, an employee of Egypt’s Atomic Energy Authority, to a
three-year prison term with hard labor on charges of blasphemy through the propagation
of “ideas contrary to Islamic principles.” A female co-defendant received a
one-year prison term, and nineteen others, said to be followers of Sayed Tolba,were
given one-year suspended sentences. The authorities arrested Sayed Tolba on
March 21 in Madinat Nasr, seizing letters and a videocassette in which he allegedly
claimed he was a messenger of God. The defendants had no right of appeal before
a higher tribunal.
The government continued to prosecute individuals on grounds of their actual
or perceived sexual orientation. On December 19, the Cairo Juvenile Appeal Court
for Misdemeanors upheld the conviction handed down to a seventeen-year-old for
“habitual debauchery,” but reduced his original three-year prison term to six
months. The boy was one of fifty-three defendants tried in 2001 in the so-called
Queen Boat case, in which the authorities charged the defendants with “debauchery”
under the Combat of Prostitution Law, and had already spent seven months in
detention, including four months held with adult prisoners. (See Human Rights
Watch World Report 2002.) Of the twenty-three adult men convicted by the Emergency
State Security Court for Misdemeanors, twenty-one received prison terms
ranging between one and two years, and two others were sentenced to three and five
year terms. In May, President Mubarak endorsed the verdicts against the latter two
but rescinded those against the twenty-one, who were then released on bail. Their
cases, together with those of their twenty-nine co-defendants who had been acquitted by the court, were referred to prosecutors once again for review. A new trial for
all fifty-two defendants opened on July 27 before an ordinary criminal court, and
was ongoing at this writing. In a separate case, four other alleged homosexuals were
convicted of “debauchery” on February 3 by the Court of Misdemeanors in Cairo
and sentenced to three-year prison terms each. During their trial, some of the
defendants said they had been beaten and otherwise tortured while in police custody.
In the third week of September they were acquitted on appeal and released.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
On June 3, the National Assembly passed a new law regulating the activities of
an estimated sixteen thousand nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Egypt,
and the law was ratified by President Mubarak two days later. Law 84 of 2002 was
intended to replace the controversial Law on Civil Associations and Institutions
(Law 153 of 1999),which was overturned by Egypt’s Supreme Constitutional Court
in June 2000 on procedural grounds. (See Human Rights Watch World Report 2002.)
The new version of the law contained an amendment, welcomed by a number of
local human rights groups, allowing administrative courts to hear cases arising
from disputes between NGOs and the authorities.However, it retained most of the
stringent regulations imposed on the activities of NGOs contained in the original
law. These included obliging NGOs to seek prior approval from the relevant government
authorities for some of their key activities, such as seeking funding from
abroad, becoming affiliated to organizations outside Egypt, and holding elections
for board members. The law also contained new provisions giving the government
even greater powers over NGOs, notably article 42 which authorized the Ministry
of Social Affairs to dissolve NGOs without recourse to a court ruling. Among the
grounds for dissolution were the participation of NGOs in political or trade union
activity deemed prohibited by the authorities and the receipt of foreign funding
without prior approval. The new law was condemned by both local and international
human rights groups, as well as by funding institutions within the European
Union.
On July 29, the Supreme State Security Court sentenced Saadeddin Ibrahim,
director of the Ibn Khaldun Center for Development Studies in Cairo, to a sevenyear
prison term at the end of a second trial that opened on April 27. The trial,
widely perceived as politically motivated and aimed at silencing real or potential
criticism of the Egyptian government (see Human Rights Watch World Report 2002
and 2001), followed a decision by the Court of Cassation overturning previous verdicts
against Ibrahim and twenty-seven co-defendants and ordering a re-trial. The
defendants had been released on February 7, 2002,but a travel ban on Ibrahim,preventing
him from seeking medical treatment abroad, had remained in force pending
the re-trial.
In the second trial, marred by irregularities described below, Ibrahim was once
again found guilty of receiving donations without prior official permission, disseminating
false information designed to undermine Egypt’ stature abroad, and
defrauding the European Union.Nadia ‘Abd al-Nour, the center’s chief accountant was convicted on the fraud charge and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment, as in
the original trial. Two other employees of the center had their two-year prison
terms for fraud reduced to one-year suspended sentences and were released shortly
thereafter. Two other defendants had their five-year prison terms for bribery and
forgery reduced to three years,while the remaining twenty-two sentences remained
unchanged.
The outcome of the second trial was widely condemned by local and international
human rights groups, as well as by member states of the European Union and
the Unites States, and by U.N.human rights mechanisms.The trial was also marked
by serious procedural irregularities, including denying the defense team adequate
time to prepare its case and the failure of the presiding judges to respond to applications
by defense lawyers for leave to challenge the constitutionality of the legislation
under which two of the charges against Ibrahim were brought. The judges
failed to respond to pleas for proceedings to be suspended to enable Ibrahim, diagnosed
as suffering from a degenerative neurological disorder, to travel abroad for
medical treatment. His health was reported to have deteriorated markedly during
his incarceration. The authorities also refused to allow representatives of international
human rights groups to visit Ibrahim and his co-defendants in prison.
In a victory for free expression, the verdict in the second trial was quashed on
appeal on December 3 and a new trial, to be heard before the Court of Cassation,
was scheduled for January 7, 2003. Ibrahim and three co-defendants serving custodial
sentences were released pending the new trial.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
During the year, Egypt’s human rights record was under scrutiny by a number
of the United Nations’ human rights mechanisms. In October, the U.N. Human
Rights Committee considered Egypt’s combined third and fourth periodic reports
on the implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
It welcomed positive developments in improving the status of women, the introduction
of human rights training and awareness programs in educational institutions
and for law-enforcement officials, and the creation of human rights divisions
within certain government ministries.The committee expressed concern about the
continuing state of emergency in the country and called for a review of the necessity
of maintaining it. It also called for a review of the “very large number of
offenses” punishable by death, with a view to abolishing the death penalty. The
committee criticized “the persistence of torture” perpetrated by law-enforcement
personnel and “the general lack of investigations into such practices, punishment
of those responsible, and reparation for the victims.” It also “noted with alarm that
military courts and state security courts had jurisdiction to try civilians accused of
terrorism although there were no guarantees of those courts’ independence and
their decisions were not subject to appeal before a higher court.” Among other
things, the committee called on Egypt to refrain from punishing “private sexual relations between consenting adults” and to review legislation governing the activities
of NGOs to enable them to operate “without obstacles.”
In November, the Committee against Torture considered Egypt’s fourth periodic
report on the implementation of the Convention Against Torture and Other
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Among other things, it
welcomed the enactment of legislation banning flogging in prisons and measures
taken to regulate procedures for unannounced inspections to places of detention.
The committee criticized the absence of mandatory inspections of prisons by an
independent body, the numerous complaints of torture and ill-treatment, including
of minors, and the absence of prompt and impartial investigations into torture
and related deaths in custody. It made a series of recommendations, among them
the abolition of incommunicado detention, enabling victims of torture to obtain
full redress, ensuring that prisons under state security jurisdiction be subjected to
mandatory inspection, and holding minors separately from adult detainees and
protecting them from abuse. The committee also urged Egypt to abolish the use of
administrative detention, to grant those convicted by military courts the right of
appeal before a higher tribunal, to allow human rights NGOs to “pursue their activities
unhindered,” and to agree to a visit by the special rapporteur on torture. In his
March report to the Commission on Human Rights, the special rapporteur had
detailed scores of cases of alleged torture and ill-treatment, including two cases of
death in custody, which he had transmitted to the government between May and
November 2001.
In her February report to the Commission on Human Rights, the secretary-general’s
special representative on human rights defenders,Hina Jilani, expressed concern
about procedural irregularities in the state security trial of Saadeddin Ibrahim
and his co-defendants. She warned that “the conviction of these members of civil
society for their human rights activities will have a chilling effect on the activities of
other human rights defenders in Egypt,” and she expressed concern about the use
of laws to restrict sources of funding for human rights defenders and to impose
related penalties. Jilani said her April 2001 request to visit Egypt remained pending,
and she had received no response from the government by July when Jilani submitted
her report to the General Assembly.
The special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom
of opinion and expression, Abid Hussain, said in his January report to the Commission
on Human Rights that he had received an invitation to visit from the
Egyptian government, but by the end of November the visit had not taken place. In
his report, the special rapporteur detailed several cases transmitted to the government,
among them the referral of twenty-two alleged Muslim Brotherhood members
to a military court. (See above.)
During a visit to Egypt in February, High Commissioner for Human Rights
Mary Robinson met with relevant government officials and representatives of
human rights and other NGOs. Among the issues of concern reportedly raised by
Robinson was the continuing state of emergency and its adverse effect on human
rights protection in the country, particularly in allowing the trial of civilians before
military and state security courts.
On May 6, 2002, Egypt ratified the International Labor Organization’s Convention concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the
Worst Forms of Child Labor (ILO Convention 182).
European Union
On November 29, 2001, the European Parliament passed a legislative resolution
giving its assent to the conclusion of the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement
between Egypt and the E.U., which had been signed in June 2001. On the
same day, the European Parliament passed another resolution expressing concern
about aspects of Egypt’s human rights record. The resolution stated that “despite
substantial efforts, progress still needs to be made . . . with regard to human rights,
freedom of expression and freedom of religious conscience,” and in strengthening
the role of civil society. It called on Egypt to take steps to ensure greater respect for
fundamental rights and to abolish the death penalty. The resolution urged the
European Council and the European Commission “to devise practical arrangements
for regular assessments” to improve “regular and impartial monitoring of
developments in the field of human rights and the extent to which human rights
activists are free to act and speak out in defense of the rights of others.” During a
visit to Egypt by External Affairs Commissioner Chris Patten in October, Foreign
Minister Ahmad Maher announced that the Association Agreement would be forwarded
to the People’s Assembly for ratification during its forthcoming session.
The agreement provided for a budget of 351 million euros for the period 2002-
2004, of which twenty million euros were earmarked for support to social development
and civil society in 2003.
On July 4, the European Parliament passed a resolution expressing concern at
the Egyptian authorities’ decision to retry fifty-two Egyptian men charged with
“debauchery” and related offenses (see above), noting that this contravened article
14 of the ICCPR, since the defendants had already been tried in an earlier trial. The
resolution urged the government to halt “all prosecution of citizens on grounds of
homosexuality and to protect their individual freedoms.”
Commissioner Patten denounced in a July 30 statement the guilty verdict
handed down to Saadeddin Ibrahim and his co-defendants in the Ibn Khaldun case
(see above), and he criticized the continued use of state security courts to hear such
cases. He said that the “questionable procedures used in the conduct of this high
profile trial, the decision to retry these defendants after a successful appeal, the
deteriorating health of the principal defendant, and the harsh outcome of the new
trial must concern those who most support Egypt in its ambitious program of economic,
social and political reform.” An E.U. Presidency statement issued on the
same day also expressed “its surprise at the hurried fashion in which the sentence
was handed down, which can throw doubt on the respect due . . . this trial.”
In a September 5 debate on the human rights situation in Egypt, European Parliament
member states expressed concern about the continued imprisonment of
Saadeddin Ibrahim and some of his co-defendants, as well as the prosecution of
alleged homosexuals on grounds of their sexual orientation, the arrest of suspected
Islamist activists, and the continuing restrictions on NGO activity. Several member
states stressed that respect for human rights was an integral part of the Association Agreement between Egypt and the E.U., and that “the democratic clause in article
2 is not a luxury,nor is it an option.”Commissioner Patten strongly condemned the
government’s handling of the Ibn Khladun case,which he said had caused “evident
damage to Egypt’s international reputation.” He reiterated that the commission
“has no evidence of financial or other wrongdoings by Dr. Ibrahim or his co-defendants
with respect to the two NGO contracts managed by them,”detailed in an affidavit
submitted during the defendants’ appeal. Following the debate, the European
Parliament passed a resolution reiterating its condemnation of the conviction of
Ibrahim and his co-defendants following a second trial in July, urging President
Mubarak “to use his powers to obtain the release of Dr. Ibrahim and his colleagues
pending a fair and final judgment.”
United States
The U.S. remained Egypt’s largest provider of foreign military and economic
assistance, estimated at U.S.$2.1 billion. However, with the noteworthy exception
of a public decision in August not to consider additional aid following the reconviction
of Saadeddin Ibrahim, the Bush administration refrained from making U.S.
assistance in any way conditional on improvements in Egypt’s poor human rights
record.
In January, the U.S. announced an accelerated assistance plan of U.S.$959 million,
which it said was aimed at helping the Egyptian economy’s recovery in the
aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the U.S. An estimated U.S.$202
million was released at the end of June, the bulk of which was aimed at supporting
the Egyptian government’s measures in combating money laundering. In a statement
on July 1, the U.S. ambassador to Egypt, David Welch, said that the U.S. government
supported “the efforts of the Egyptian government in preventing the flow
of money to terrorists and criminal groups.”
On August 15, the Bush administration announced that it would not consider
further aid to Egypt in response to the July 29 conviction of Saadeddin Ibrahim,
who held dual Egyptian-U.S. citizenship, and his co-defendants. Earlier, a State
Department spokesperson said the administration was “deeply disappointed” at
the verdict, and that it would “continue to follow Dr. Ibrahim’s case closely” and
press its concerns with the Egyptian authorities.U.S. officials made clear, however,
that Egypt’s annual $2.1 billion of military and economic assistance was “not in
danger.” The Bush administration also did not comment on the politically motivated
arrests and unfair trials of scores of alleged Islamist opponents of President
Mubarak’s government.
In its Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2001, released in March
2002, the State Department said that Egypt’s record “remained poor with respect to
freedom of expression and its continued referral of citizens to trial in military or
State Security Emergency courts, among other areas.” It criticized the use of emergency
legislation to restrict basic rights, and said, “In combating terrorism, the
security forces continued to mistreat and torture prisoners, arbitrarily arrest and
detain persons, hold detainees in prolonged pre-trial detention, and occasionally
engage in mass arrests. In actions unrelated to the anti-terrorist campaign, local police killed, tortured and otherwise abused both criminal suspects and other persons.”
It also said that prison conditions remained poor.
In its Annual Report on International Religious Freedom for 2002, released in
October, the State Department said that “there was a continued trend toward
improvement in the Government’s respect for religious freedom,” but that certain
abuses and restrictions remained. It said that the government “continued to prosecute
for unorthodox religious beliefs and practices under the charge of ‘insulting
heavenly religions.’”
Secretary of State Colin Powell visited Egypt in early April as part of a wider
Middle East tour. Talks held with President Mubarak and government officials
focused on the revival of the Middle East peace process in the context of the deteriorating
security situation in Israel and the Palestinian Authority areas. The continued
violence between Israelis and Palestinians also dominated talks between
President Mubarak and President Bush when the former visited Washington,D.C.,
in early June.
