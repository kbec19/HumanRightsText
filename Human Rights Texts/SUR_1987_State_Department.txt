 SURINAME
 Surinzme is a country in'transiti'on from authoritarian military
 rule to democracy. "On September 30, over 95 percent of the
 eopld voted in:a referedum'to upptove'a new Constitution.
 On November 25il198'7;'.,in honest 'and -peaceful elections,
 Surinamese'repudi'ated7year' of authoritarian military rule
 by'A&mY Cdmmander Desire D. Boutefse'znd voted overwhelmingly
 to'retun 'to genuine democraoy'under the leadership of the
 Front for Democracy and DeVelopment. The Front won a
 two-thirds majority in the National-Assembly which was more
 than -enough to elect the president and to amend the new
 Constiu6ion. A U.S, Presidential delegation sent to observe
 the elections found them to be free and fair. 'Bouterse has
 promised'-to restect the outcdme'of the elections. While these'
 deve4ropments-hav6.not led to instant democracy'in Suriname,
 there is pfdmisefor the future. On January 12, 1988, the

 sucddssior of appointed civilian'cabinets wds responsible for
 the day-t6-day'govdrning of thelcountry'during this period,
 ultimate political authority'remained ir'the hands of Commander
 Bouterse, officially Head of Government, since 1985.
 Under political pressure from both inside and outside of
 Surifid,"r~inforced by atste4dily declning economy Bouterse
 agreed in November 1985 to a timetable fo- -the-dtafting of a
 new constitution and for a gradual transition to democracy.
 Later that year, Suriname's three major pieCdup-political
 parties agreed to take part in the "democratization" process.

 In July"'986, an ihsurgentrmovement. led by a  disaffected,
 ex-soldier, Robny B'runswijk, allegedly'supported by political
 exiles based in the Netherlands,, arose among the Bush Negroes,
 an ethnit'group made up-of the descendants of escaped African
 slaves. Bush Negroes constitute about 10 percent of Suriname's
 population of 400,000 and live, for the most part, in isolated
 
 
 608
 SURINAME
 villages in the jungles of eastern and central Suriname. The
 outbreak of the insurgency led to a drastic worsening of an
 already poor human rights situation. The army's efforts to
 crush the insurgency resulted in the indiscriminate killing of
 many Bush Negro noncombatants; including women and children,
 and the detention without trial of, scores of suspected
 Brunswijk sympathizers. The state of emergency, in effect for
 the eastern half of the country since December 1986, imposes a
 dusk-to-dawn curfew, prohibits gatherings of any kind, and
 restricts travel in the affected area.
 The approval of the Constitution and holding of free and fair
 elections represents considerable progress towards
 democratization. However, serious human rights problems
 continued in 1987: innocent civilians are stillbeing killed
 by an army intent on wiping out the insurgency and its
 perceived sympathizers; opponents of the regime were held by
 the army under inhuman conditions, without trial and without
 access to legal counsel until released in December 1987; .the
 freedom of the media to collect and disseminate information
 about events in Suriname is limited; and citizens' freedom of
 movement within the country continues to be subject to control
 by the army and insurgents,. Whether the newly elected
 Government will be able to establish civilian control over the
 army, restore the rule of law, and bring an end to serious
 human rights abuses is an open question.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for theIntegrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 According to credible eyewitness reports, the military,
 combating the insurgency in eastern and southern Suriname,
 continues to kill indiscriminately noncombatant Bush Negroes,
 including women and children. Although allegations of
 military death squad activity haye decreased since 1986,
 widespread suspicions persist that the military executes Bush
 Negroes sympathizers of the insurgents. Many of these reports
 implicated the "mobile eenheid", a special volunteer unit
 assigned to police functions in. army operational areas.
 Eyewitnesses say that two residents of the-village of Wanhati
 in the Marowijne district were killed when the village was
 overrun by the army on February 2, 1987; a number of villagers
 were wounded. In April three Bush Negroes were arrested in
 the town of Moengo by soldiers; later their bodies were'found
 in the nearby Cottica River. In June a 32-year old Bush Negro
 suspected of being an insurgent was detained by the army in
 Paranam; he was executed on the spot by an officer, who was
 later convicted of the killing, dismissed from the army and
 given a 10-year prison sentence. In September the army claimed
 to have killed nearly 40 "terrorists" near the village of
 Pokigron in Sipaliwini. However, residents of the area claim
 that not more than 3 of those killed were insurgents; at least
 ,13 innocent civilians were. killed, including 3 children, and
 the death toll may have been higher. Eyewitnesses reported
 that as late as December 31, just before the expiration of a
 unilateral ceasefire declared by the insurgents, soldiers
 opened fire on civilians near Pokignon killing two and
 wounding at least five more. The victims were taken away by
 the soldiers and, according to the one survivor, the others
 were executed by their captors.

 SURINAME
 b.--,Disappearance
 There were few-credible reports of kidnaping.or disappearance
 in 1987, Most of those persons -alleged to have disappeared in
 1986 later proved to have been detained by-the military police,
 and the last group of detainees, numbering about 20, was
 released in December.1987. - . ï¿½
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment "
 According to former detainees released from the military prison
 at Fort Zeelandia. the military police commonly used torture
 in irlterrogating suspects. Methods used include-beatings with
 hard rubber truncheons, slashing with bayonets, and kicks and
 punches. Detainees were often kept handcuffed for days at a
 time,- Were poorly fed and were subjected to inadequate
 sanitary conditions., One released detainee described having
 been-head~for 9 months in a-3-meter-by 3-meter cell with 12
 other men. ,PrisQners were very rarelyallowed to exercise or
 to receive visits, and many were held incommunicado for
 months, .so-thei-5ifamilies wereL.unable to learn whether they'
 were alive or dead. v.
 While s.pqqcted inaurgent-sympathizeTs.-and dollaborators have
 been subjected .to-the worst tireatmefit, thefe have been other
 instances,'of mistreatment; including severe beatings of.
 stident;dejmonstrators ata Paramaribo secondary school in
 February/iwhich.thq.'official.'National Institute-of Human
 Rights (NIM> strongly denounced. Three military policemen
 were given jai-lizentences by a military court as a regult of
 this incident.    t
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Beginning with the outbreak of the insurgency in July 1986,
 over 100 people, mostly Bush Negroes, were detained in Fort
 Zeelandiaj the raval  base and the-beadquarters of the Central
 Intelligence Service (CID), for extended periods'of time.
 Many more were detained, questioned, .and released -after
 periods of-severa-l hours, 'severa-l- days,-or months. In a few -
 cases, ':theindi'viduals detained allegedly were invorlvd in
 so-called antiregime activity:. -for example, ofgani-ing.
 demonstrations a nd.conversing by telephone with Vxiles in the
 Netherlands. However, in most cases suspects'were picked up
 merely bedause they Were related -to insurgents, becaUse they
 traveled between, the city and; the interior, or simply because
 they, -ure-.Bush -Negroes. found in areas 'where the insurgents
 werm;-tbought to be operating. -No-charges wert ever filed in
 any of these cases.. Access to lega'X counsel--was denied in
 most cases. Fifty to sixty detainees were released in
 December 1986, afid an undetermined number were rerelased in
 August and September of 1987, shortly before a visit of Amos
 Wako, the U.N. Special Rapporteur for Summary Ahd Arbitrary
 Executiqrn. :A delegation fXom the Tnter-American Commission
 on HumarrRights z(IACHR)' visited -19 detainees in Fort Zeelandia
 in October 198-. The-army released 20 detainees from Fort
 Zeelandia-on'Decembr. 1. It called- them-the last group of
 "Brunswijk gang members" who were held at the 'fort. Human
 rights organizations in Paramalibo, including the Internatidnar
 Committee-of the Red Cross (ICRC), believe that no victims of
 arbitrary arrest or detention'remain in custody at'this time.
 According to Surinamese. law, a person- suspected of having
 committed a crime for which the-'sentence'is longer than 4
 
 
 610
 SURINAME
 years may be detained for investigation for up to 10 days
 before being brought before a judge to be charged. He may be
 detained longer only if a judge decides there is sufficient
 evidence to support the charge. There is no provision for
 bail during this period.
 There were no reports of forced or compulsory labor in
 Suriname.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary continues to maintain its independence and to
 provide fair public trials when accused persons are turned
 over to it. However, the military police,'who are empowered
 to arrest civilians, frequently did not turn civilian
 detainees over to the courts, particularly when persons
 accused of "destabilizing" or "antirevolutionary" activities
 were involved. In late May, Commander Bouterse told
 journalists that the detainees in Fort Zeelandia were entitled
 to legal counsel, but that.none of them had chosen to exercise
 that right. However, both attorneys and family members of
 detainees stated that very few lawyers were willing to take on
 the cases of the Fort Zeelandia detainees out of fear of being
 marked as opponents of the military. The few lawyers who
 agreed to represent detainees were routinely denied access to
 their clients. The office of the Attorney General is
 responsible for assuring that detainees are charged and tried
 within the time periods prescribed by law, but it did not take
 any action in the cases of persons detained by the military
 police. Judges, attorneys, and officials of the National
 Institute for Human Rights claimed that they have no legal
 basis for filing complaints regarding the army's failure to
 bring charges against the detainees, or to bring them to trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The military police continued to exercise the authority to
 enter any home without a'warrant to conduct searches.
 Telephone conversations, particularly calls to other
 countries, are believed to be monitored by the military
 police.   Members of-the People's Militia and employees of the
 Directorate of People's Mobilization serve as informants,
 helping the military authorities to keep track of the
 whereabouts and activities of suspected opponents. Government
 jamming of the Radio Netherlands Caribbean Service, which
 often carries items from the Dutch press about Suriname, was
 sporadic in 1907. Dutch newspapers and journals have not been
 available to the public since 1982, and publications from the
 Netherlands do not reach subscribers in Suriname.
 g. Violations of Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflicts
 In dealing with the insurgency, the army appears to have
 adopted a strategy of undermining support for the insurgents
 by applying pressure on the civilian population in the areas
 affected by the conflict. The -army repeatedly warded
 civilians to leave the areas where the insurgents operated.
 Thousands of Bush Negroes and hundreds of Amerindians fled
 their homes in the east and south to the relative safety of
 the Paramaribo area and neighboring French Guiana where French
 authorities assist over 9,000 refugees in 5 camps. Those who
 failed to heed these warnings were treated as supporters of
 the insurgents. In what the military described as "clean-up
 actions," army units regularly swept through villages in the
 
 
 611
 SURINAME
 war zone, driving out the civilian population in a purported
 search for insurgents. Eyewitness reports of such raids in
 Wanhati (February), Happyland (April), Marechal and Koffiekamp
 (May), and Pokigron (September)- as well as similar reports of
 incidents in Brownsweg, Witagron, and Suhoza, all reflect a
 pattern, much like that which marked army actions against the
 villages of Morakondre, Mooiwanna and Moengotapoe -in 1986:
 the villages were raked with machine gun fire from helicopters
 or armored vehicles, then homes, stores and public buildings
 were looted and often burned. Villagers frightened by the
 shooting ran into the bush, and anyone seen fleeing was
 presumed to be an insurgent by the soldiers and consequently a
 target. The army also restricted movement of food and medical
 supplies into the interior. As a result, food shortages and
 healfh problems have become serious in the interior.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Surinamese remain circumspect about publicly criticizing the
 military. The press in Suriname is not free and much of the
 media is directly controlled by the Government. The private
 media are subject to both formal and informal restrictions.
 The progovernment bias of the state-owned television stations
 was clearly evident in the weeks leading up to the November
 elections. The progovernment National Democratic Party of
 Suriname (NDP) was given extensive television coverage while
 rival parties, campaigns were slighted or ignored altogether.
 The official Suriname News Agency, which, like the National
 Information Service (NVD), is headed by an army officer,
 openly describes itself as "a child of the revolution," and
 its critics as "spokemen for neocolonial powers."
 Journalists who have dared to-criticize the Government have
 themselves been subjected to criticism and even threats; two
 reporters for De Ware Tijd, the more independent of Suriname's
 two daily private papers, were granted political asylum in the
 Netherlands in April after claiming that threats against them
 had made it too dangerous for them to return to Suriname. De
 Ware Tijd itself was closed for about 3 months in 1987 because
 the Central Bank refused to make available foreign exchange
 for the purchase of newsprint. Paramaribo's other, less
 critical daily paper, De West, had no trouble importing the
 newsprint it needed. Access to information from the war zones
 in the interior remained restricted; journalists were seldom
 allowed to visit those areas, and NVD news releases were the
 only source of information on the fighting. The Government
 was selective in approving visas for Dutch journalists seeking
 to cover the elections, refusing some on the grounds that the
 bias of the Dutch press interferes with the improvement in
 relations between the two countries.
 There are three public and three private radio stations. In
 addition, the Catholic and Moravian Churches publish small
 weekly nlwspapers which often carry articles c6mmenting on
 political and human'rights issues. The Lutheran and Reformed
 Churches also publish a combined monthly journal.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Restrictions on political gatherings were relaxed as the
 November elections approached. Opposition parties held
 rallies in the seven districts not affected by the insurgency,
 although licenses were required before mass meetings could
 
 
 612
 SURINAME
 take place; sometimes there were delays in granting licenses,
 and at other times permission was denied to hold meetings at
 the places or times requested. Student demonstrations in
 February, sparked by the deteriorating economy, were at first
 met by restraint by the military. After 2 or 3 days of unrest,
 however, the military jailed several organizers of the
 demonstrations, and several students were severely beaten,
 apparently with little or no provocation.
 The state of emergency reimposed in December 1986 remains in
 effect; its provisions prohibit gatherings of any kind in the
 area covered under the decree, which includes four districts
 and part of another, impose a dusk-to-dawn curfew in two
 districts, and restrict movement in eastern Suriname. In
 practice, however, gatherings do take place in some of these
 areas, though approval must be obtained from the military.
 Half the labor force is unionized. Labor organizing, union
 elections, wage negotiations, and labor actions, including
 strikes, normally take place freely. However, most labor
 leaders continue to be cautious in their dealings with the
 Government. In October bauxite workers at the Moengo mines
 staged a short wildcat strike to demonstrate solidarity with
 two workers who were allegedly beaten during interrogation by
 the army.
 Two of the labor federations organized a new political party,
 the Surinamese Labor Party, while another is formally allied
 with one of the traditional parties. Three of Suriname's four
 labor federations and two business associations participated
 in the Government's drafting of the new Constitution. Unions
 and business organizations are free to affiliate with
 international bodies.
 In November 1986, the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions suspended the Moederbond Labor Federation because
 of its alleged support for the Bouterse regime.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of worship is respected. No one religion is favored
 over another, nor is there discrimination against members of
 any religious group. Foreign clergy are allowed to minister
 to the needs of both local and expatriate congregations, and
 missionaries are allowed to enter the country to proselytize.
 Religious groups maintain international contacts and freely
 organize trips abroad. Articles and programs sponsored by
 religious groups appear in the newspapers and on radio and
 television, and several churches publish their own periodicals,
 which often have been critical of the military. However, such
 criticism has, on occasion, provoked heated attacks on the
 churches in the official media; for example, the Suriname News
 Agency in October denounced the "deceit and preaching of
 hatred" in certain church-sponsored bulletins, which, it said,
 "distort facts and stir up people." A biweekly television
 program produced by the Roman Catholic Church has, on several
 occasions, been taken off the air because censors from the
 National Information Service objected to the content of the
 broadcasts, which dealt with political topics.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Surinamese may change residences and workplaces freely. They
 generally may travel abroad as they wish; however, travel
 
 
 613
 SURINAME
 within _uripamp is.restricted because of the state of emeigency
 in effect i-easternSuriname. Drivers of motor vehicles in
 areas:u.der;,the state of.emergency must have passes issued by
 theD ir torate of.People'-s Mobilization; and these are ofteh
 arbitrarily Nithheld. ', Vehicles and individuals traveling to
 or frq..the interior are subject to search at army checkpoints.
 Surinamiese may emigrate without interference and may 'return to

 haraasd if~thqy.return-to the.coW, try. However, those exiles'

 spokesman said that the Military-Command would f~nction as the
 political arm and the representative organ of the army.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude.Regarding.International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 . of Himan:Rights,..  -      ï¿½
 During 1987 the government'appointed National Institute for
 Human Rights (NIM) played a somewhat more active role in
 examining human rights abuses.. Under pressure from the
 public, the NI4 investigated the beatings of students by the
 military police during the February student demonstrations,
 and the NIM report led to the sentencing of two military
 police personnel involved in these acts of violence.
 During 1987 the Government invited delegations'from both the
 OAS Inter-American Committee on Human Rights (IACHR) and the
 United Nations Human Rights.Commission (UNHRC) to investigate
 reports of violations of human rights. The UNHRC delegation,
 led by, Amos Wako, visited Suriname in'August and ret with'
 
 
 614
 SURINAM4E
 several witnesses of human rights violations by the military.
 The Wako delegation also visited Fort Zeelandia prison. The
 IACHR, which visited Suriname in October, conducted extensive
 interviews with Government officials and private individuals.
 However, the delegation was unable to travel outside
 Paramaribo. At a press conference at the conclusion of the
 IACHR visit, Dr. Oliver Jackman of Barbados expressed concern
 over the inability of thedelegation to investigate all- the
 various allegations that had-come to-their attention,
 particularly the treatment of Bush Negroes and allegations of
 arbitrary detention and torture.
 Both the U.N. and the OAS delegations voiced serious concern
 over the human rights situation in Suriname-., The IACHR report
 on Suriname described the human rights situation as precarious,
 asserted that there was no freedom of the press, and that
 freedom of association was limited by the state of emergency.
 The ICRC and the EEC/ACP also visited Suriname in 1987. The
 ICRC focused on the refugee problem while the EEC/ACP reviewed
 the human rights situation in the context of possible economic
 aid. In a positive move, the Government -approved -the
 stationing of  n ICRC delegation in Suriname to visit
 detainees- held by both the army and the -insurgents and to
 provkde medical supplies to hospitals and to those people
 isolated by the conflict.
 Amnesty International's 1987 Report, which covered the events
 of 1986,-was highly critical of the human rights'situation in'
 Suriname.. lso in 198.7, the U.S. Committee -on Refugees (a-
 private organization not affiliated with the United- States
 Government) published- a, report critical of the Government's
 policy with regard to Surinamese refugees. Discussions have
 been held between the Government of Suriname,-French
 authorities, the ICRC,the UNHCR, and representatives of the
 refugees regarding their-evehtual voluntary repatriation to
 Suriname onceqconditions permit.
 During 1987 a. group called Organization for-,Justice and Peace
 was formed by religious leaders and private individuals. This
 group urged the Government to stop human rights violations and
 to punish those responsible for such abuses. Another group
 concerned with human rights violations was formed by a leading
 Bush Negro intellectual. Its main aim was to highlight the
 plight of the Bush Negroes and enlist national and
 international support on their behalf.
 SECTION 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Women have equal access to education and employment, although
 social pressures and customs still inhibit women from fully
 exercising these rights. Racial discrimination is prohibited
 and is uncommon in Suriname's multiracial society. However,
 ethnic consciousness remains strong among all groups and has
 been exacerbated by the current fighting between the
 predominantly Creole army and the'Bush Negro insurgents.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 There is no legal minimum wage in Suriname, but wages are
 generally high by regional standards and provide workers an
 adequate standard of living. The workweek in most companies
 is between 39 and 45 hours. The legal minimum age for
 employment of children is 14, except in the fisheries industry
