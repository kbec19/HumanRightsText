 SOMALIA
 Determined to bring about a socialist transformation in
 Somalia's society, the Government of the Somali Democratic
 Republic has subordinated individual liberties to its
 political and economic goals, particularly maintaining
 national unity and bringing about a more equitable distribu-
 tion of Somalia's limited material resources. The Government
 has emphasized the elimination of tribal and clan divisions
 and has greatly improved the status of women, despite opposi-
 tion from traditional sectors of Somali society. Women now
 enjoy full political and economic rights and hold several
 prominent government positions. Major progress has been made
 toward increasing literacy among Somalis. A new constitution
 was overwhelmingly approved in August 1979 in a referendum
 which the Government apparently orchestrated. The Govern-
 ment's security apparatus remains pervasive, although
 since Soviet advisors left in late 1977 there has been
 substantial relaxation in the security-conscious atmosphere.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Torture
 Although exiled dissidents have occasionally claimed that
 torture is used to obtain confessions in security cases, the
 Department of State has no information to confirm these
 reports. The new constitution provides that detained prison-
 ers shall not be subjected to physical or mental torture.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The State Department has no evidence of cruel, inhuman or
 degrading punishment in recent years. The new constitution
 prohibits corporal punishment of prisoners. However,
 Amnesty International in its 1978 report expressed concern
 about alleged "harsh" conditions of detention. The Prisons
 Law of 1971 provides for regulated forced labor, with
 prisoners entitled to remuneration. The law mandates
 adequate food for prisoners. Solitary confinement is legal
 and practiced.
 There are no reports of summary executions in Somalia,
 although there have been a number of executions following
 trial; in October 1978, 17 army officers were tried and
 executed for their involvement in the coup attempt of April
 1978.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrests, detention and imprisonment have been
 used against suspected political opponents of the Government.
 Amnesty International has stated that a major concern in
 Somalia is the indefinite detention without trial of oppo-
 nents of the Government's policies. Many of the officials of
 the previous regime who were detained following President
 Siad's accession to power in 1969 have since been appointed
 to positions of responsibility in the Government. Some,
 however, remain in detention; their number has been estimat-
 ed at about 30, including a former Prime Minister, who is one
 
 (176)
 
 
 177
 of Amnesty International's 13 adopted "prisoners of conscience"
 in Somalia. The State Department lacks reliable figures on
 the total number of political prisoners in Somalia, although
 Somali exiles have alleged that there are at least several
 hundred. The new constitution provides that every person
 deprived of personal liberty "shall forthwith be informed of
 the offense of which he is accused"; and that anyone detained
 on security grounds shall "without delay" be brought before a
 competent judicial authority within the time limit prescribed
 by law.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Political dissidents are not always accorded a public
 trial. The former Prime Minister referred to above is
 being held without trial. A National Security Court has
 jurisdiction over a broad range of crimes, including attacks
 against the state, the public administration, members of the
 government, the military forces, or public order. The Court
 appears to be a political instrument of the Government,
 executing political decisions. Defendants before this Court
 are reportedly given the right of legal counsel. Amnesty
 International has stated that another of its concerns in
 Somalia is "unfair trials" by this court.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Political dissidents and those suspected of political
 dissent are subject to occasional arbitrary searches of
 homes. In these cases, Somali law protecting sanctity
 of the home is superseded by search and seizure authority
 of the National Security Service. The new constitution
 provides for inviolability of the home -- with certain
 exceptions such as those related to security or "pursuant to
 an act of the competent judicial authority" as provided by
 law.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The Somali Government is making serious efforts to fulfill
 the vital needs of the majority of the population through
 economic development, but its resources are limited. Somalia
 contains a largely rural, nomadic society and the country is
 poor in natural resources. The economy is mixed with the
 Government emphasis on the public sector. The Government
 stresses an equitable distribution of income. In practice
 this has meant a policy of leveling incomes, which, together
 with the downgrading of the private sector, has resulted in
 the exodus of a number of the country's managerial and
 skilled personnel to nearby Arab countries, thus exacerbating
 Somalia's economic problems. Somalia's inadequate level of
 trained manpower is a major obstacle to development.
 There is some corruption in Somalia, but Government officials,
 including the President, show considerable austerity in their
 personal lives. There is relatively little difference
 between the life styles of civil servants and ranking Govern-
 ment officials. The Government's nationwide literacy campaign,
 begun in 1972 with the introduction of a written script for
 the Somali language, has achieved impressive results. The
 Government now estimates 60 percent of the population
 is able to read Somali. Major efforts have been made
 to improve health care, diet, housing and job training.
 
 
 178
 However, bureaucratic inefficiency, a doctrinaire approach,
 and the nomadic nature of much of the population have weaken-
 ed the impact of these efforts.
 A large increase in war refugees from nearby regions of
 Ethiopia has been an added burden and has compelled the
 Somali Government to declare a state of emergency.
 Somalia's total of more than 300,000 refugees in camps
 (as of September 1979) is greater than almost any other
 African country. Despite the constant demands on its
 limited resources, the Government, with international
 help, has been effectively meeting the immediate needs
 of these refugees. The problem of permanent resettle-
 ment will remain a long-term challenge.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion, and
 Assembly
 The Somali Government has shown little tolerance for freedom
 of speech or assembly. There is no freedom of the press,
 which is entirely controlled by the Government and the ruling
 party. The press does not air opposition views. The new
 constitution reportedly provides for freedom of assembly,
 press and speech, but adds that the exercise of these freedoms
 shall not contravene "the laws of the land, general morality,
 and public order."
 The Somalis, a Muslim people, are allowed to practice
 their faith freely so long as their religious leaders
 do not challenge the political orientation or legitimacy
 of the government. In 1975, opposition to the Government's
 program of equal rights for women surfaced when ten Muslim
 leaders publicly protested against changes in the inheri-
 tance laws. The ten were arrested and subsequently exe-
 cuted. Christians and other non-Muslims are allowed to
 worship freely but may not proselytize.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Although there are no legal restrictions on movement within
 the country for Somali citizens, the military and police
 monitor movement along main roads, particularly near larger
 urban areas and military emplacements. Complete Government
 control or monitoring is impossible in a country where an
 estimated 70 percent of the population lead nomadic or
 semi-nomadic lives. Air travel on domestic flights is
 monitored and controlled for both Somali citizens and foreign-
 ers. Although there remain restrictions on travel abroad,
 issuance of passports has become far more liberal in the past
 two years. A relatively large number of Somalis travel
 abroad, primarily to Saudi Arabia and other Mid-Eastern
 countries. An estimated 10,000 Somali Moslems each year make
 the pilgramage to Mecca. Movement across the Kenyan, Ethio-
 pian and Djiboutian frontiers cannot be effectively controlled.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Somalia has an authoritarian political system, in which
 the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party (SRSP), appointed by
 President Siad, has been established as the supreme political
 organ. According to Somali officials, the Central Committee
 
 
 179
 of the SRSP debates issues seriously and regularly. President
 Siad has frequently asserted that he requires a party consen-
 -sus to act. Under the present Government there have been no
 elections of local or national Government officials. The
 Government is committed to reducing the influence of "tribal-
 ism". Traditional tribal or clan leadership responsibilities
 or titles have been abolished, but traditional tribal
 elders still maintain an important role and are unofficially
 consulted by Government leaders.
 In August 1979 the Government held a referendum on Somalia's
 first constitution since 1969. Prior to the referendum
 Government and party representatives had visited all areas of
 the country to explain the provisions of the constitution.
 The result was a 99.7 percent "yes" vote. The new constitu-
 tion is not expected to change the system of Government but
 rather to formalize the system that has been in effect
 since 1969. The first major political event under the
 new constitutional system will be the election of the
 National Assembly. The constitution specifies that the
 SRSP is the only legal political organization.
 The Somali Government has made considerable strides in
 advancing the status of women in recent years. The new
 Government explicitly confers legal equality on women.
 The Government has changed laws governing inheritance
 and divorce and has promoted women's causes.  The Government
 has also made considerable effort to insure greater participa-
 tion for women in a variety of areas previously closed to
 them, notably in the education system and the work force.
 The Somali Women's Democratic Organization is in the forefront
 of these programs. The Government has undertaken this policy
 despite strong opposition from many quarters of this essen-
 tially conservative Muslim country, where women traditionally
 have played an inferior role.
 Somalia has no independent labor movement. The General
 Federation of Somali Trade Unions is essentially an arm of
 the party. The right to strike and to bargain collectively
 is not recognized. The Government has, however, implemented
 legislation to protect workers and ensure fair compensation
 for work.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The Department of State is unaware of any visits to Somalia
 by non-governmental organizations concerned with human rights.
 In 1979 Amnesty International sought permission to visit
 Somalia but received no reply from the Somali Government.
