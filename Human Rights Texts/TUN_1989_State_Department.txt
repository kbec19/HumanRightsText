 Tunisia is a republic in which the President and his party
 dominate decisionmaking at all levels. -The President appoints
 the Prime Minister, the Cabinet, and all 23 governbrs. The
 elected Chamber of Deputies has limited power. President
 Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was unopposed in April 1989 elections
 which, at the request of the opposition, he had advanced from
 1991. His ruling Constitutional Democratic Party (RCD) won
 all seats in the Chamber of Deputies after a leading
 opposition party rejected a government-proposed common voting
 list -which would have given the opposition some seats. The
 results were influenced by a winner-take-all voting system,
 the inability of many voters to register, and heavy-handed RCD
 tactics. Moreover, although Islamist candidates running as
 -independents averaged 18 percent of the vote wherever they
 ran, the Islamist party An Nahda continued to be denied legal
 status. Following the elections, President Ben Ali appointed
 some leading opposition figures to his Cabinet.
 Tunisia's internal security is maintained by civilian
 services, backed. by armed forces in times of crisis. Since
 President Ben Ali assumed -power in 1987, these services have
 generally avoided repressive measures,.but reports of police
 harassment and arrests of some opposition activists following
 the April elections suggested a trend toward tighter control,
 especially of the activities of unrecognized parties.
 The Government continued to implement structural adjustment of
 the economy. In addition .to easing requirements for
 investmentland-liberalizing trade, the Government reduced the
 subsidy on staple foods, including bread, by raising prices an
 average of 17 percent. Exports increased despite a decline in
 .petroleum production, and imports of capital goods and raw
 materials also rose. However, the agricultural sector
 continued-to suffer the effects of drought: the Government
 estimated that 50,000 agricultural jobs had been lost because
 of the drought, exacerbating already serious unemployment.
 There were both human rights advances and-setbacks in 1989.
 The Government legalized several new associations,--including
 the independent Democratic Womens' Association, and lifted
 restrictions which had prevented the free functioning of trade
 unions. By pardoning all prisoners who had participated in
 the plot by Islamist radicals to oventhrow ex-president
 Bourguiba, .President Ben Ali emptied thetprisons of virtually
 all political prisoners. The President also initiated a
 general amnesty which tteoretically should restore civil and
 political rights to about 5,500 ex-prisoners. Among areas of
 continuing concern were freedom of speech and press, freedom
 of assembly and association, and the right of citizens to
 change their government. Some Islamists claimed to have lost
 their jobs or to have suffered other forms of harassment.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of such killings in 1989.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance in 1989.
 
 
 1592
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Despite Tunisia's ratification of-the U.N. Convention on
 Torture in 1988, there were isolated reports of torture in
 1989. On June 6, five Islamists were arrested in Tunis, and
 three were tortured. Interior Ministry officials told the
 Tunisian Human Rights League that the torture had been
 committed by irresponsible subordinates. No disciplinary
 action is known to have been taken against those responsible.
 According to Amnesty International (AI), one detainee from the
 1987 coup plot, who was released in -ay, is unable to walk as
 the result of injuries suffered during his detention of 16
 months. Through the sunmrer and fall of 1989, the Human Rights
 League'continued to receive reports of other maltreatment from
 around the country, apparently aimed for the most part at
 those who demonstrated support for opposition parties in the
 April elections. The League reported that 2 of the 6 members
 of the illegal Communist Workers Party (POCT) arrested for
 dissemination of political tracts were severely beaten and
 suffered sleep deprivation during their detention. There were
 also reports of the abuse of nonpolitical prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There were no reported cases of, arbitrary arrest, detention,
 or exile, and President Ben Ali released 72 prisoners detained
 without trial as conspirators in the 198 coup plot.
 Under Tunisian law, arrests can be made without a warrant.
 Under a law adopted in-1987, prearraignment detention is
 limited-to between 4 and 10 days. The accused is told the
 grounds for the arrest and is then questioned. A detainee may
 request an examination by a medical doctor but may otherwise
 be held incommunicado. During-prearraignment detention,
 detainees do not have the right to a -lawyer, but they have the
 right to a -lawyer at their arraignment,- and the Government
 provides legal assistance to indigent detainees. Pretrial
 detention-is limited to 6 months, renewable by an arraignment
 judge for-up to two additional 6-month periods in the case of
 felony indidtments.
 Exile was not used as"a means of political control in 1989.
 With regard.to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. *-Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Tunisia's court system is highly centralized under the Justice
 Ministry. Trials are open to the public, and both domestic
 and foreign observers are able-to attend. No secret trials
 were known to'have been held in 1989.' Having abolished both
 the position of General Prosecutor of the Republic and the
 State Security Court in 1987, President Ben Ali'has also
 advocated a more independent judiciary. However, the
 executive branch's discretion in naming, assigning, and
 granting tenure to judges makes them susceptible to pressure.
 Human rights activists advocate a reduction in executive
 branch control in order to establish more judicial
 independence.
 In September the passport of Bechir Essid, Secretary General
 of the unrecognized pro-Libyan Arab Nationalist Party, was
 confiscated, and he was subsequently arrested for defamation
 
 
 1593
 TUNISIA
 of the President. Essid's trial was postponed in late
 September when Essid began a hunger strike.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the person
 as well as the inviolability of the home and privacy in
 correspondence, "except in exceptional cases defined by law."
 Pdlice must have a search warrant, but this requirement is
 often ignored in cases concerning state security.
 In 1989 the Government again stepped up surveillance of
 opposition groups. This policy seemed directed especially at
 those identified as Islamist (those who believe that Islam
 should be the point of reference for the political, economic,
 and social structures of their country). The Human Rights
 League reported that the home of a member of the Islamist
 movement's An Nahda Party, who also serves in the League, was
 broken into and his papers confiscated. An Nahda members
 claimed that Interior Ministry personnel kept their homes
 under surveillance. Prisoners who were detained but never
 tried for participation in the 1987 coup plot asserted that
 their houses remained under surveillance and that their
 families and friends continued to be harassed. Some
 opposition party members claimed that their telephones were
 tapped. There were also numerous reports of mail being
 opened, including the mail of human rights activists.
 Islamist attorneys claimed that their clients were being
 stopped and interviewed by plainsclothesmen at the entrances
 to their offices, and that local ruling party officials
 interfered with their businesses, causing them financial
 hardship. Visitors to the homes of Islamists reported that
 police recorded their license plate numbers.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Tunisians discuss politics in private with relative freedom,
 both among themselves and with foreigners. However, in August
 Jalloul Azzouna, a professor who attempted to establish a
 rival leadership to the legal Popular Unity Party-(PUP), was
 sentenced to a year in prison for defaming the Head of State
 and publishing communiques without authorization. He was
 released under a presidential pardon in November. His lawyer,
 Radhia Nasraoui of the illegal Communist Workers Party (POCT),
 was herself charged with defamation based on her defense
 statements during Azzouna's trial. She was released on bail,
 pending trial.
 The press continues to operate under the relatively severe
 press code adopted in 1988, which requires the printer to
 deposit copies with the Information, Interior, and Justice
 Ministries of all newspapers and other publications prepared
 in Tunisia. Political tracts must also be submitted for
 approval, and the Tunisian press reported in October that an
 Interior Ministry circular orders the arrest of those who
 possess or circulate illegal tracts. Since 1988 suspensions
 of publications have normally required the approval of a
 judge, and they may apply only to a single issue of a
 newspaper or magazine. The Interior Ministry can order the
 seizure of all copies of a single issue of a journal from the
 newsstands if the Ministry considers that the issue will be
 "of a kind to disturb public order." The ruling on a
 
 
 1594
 TUNlISIA
 publication must be made within 3 days from the time it is
 submitted. Apart from official censorship, this system leads
 to a great deal of self-censorship on the part of publications.
 The Tunisian press offers a wide range of publications in
 Arabic and French. Foreign newspapers are available.
 However, citing a lack of funds, all four of Tunisia's legal
 opposition party newspapers ceased publication after the April
 elections. These included those of the Communist Party (PCT),
 the Movement of Social Democrats (MDS), the Socialist
 Progressive Rally (RSP) and the Popular Unity Party (PUP).
 The M1DS and PUP subsequently announced that they would resume
 publication of their newspapers, and the MDS paper El Mostaqbal
 has reappeared. After a brief reappearance, the independent
 paper Le Phare also ceased publication because of financial
 problems. However, Tunisia's labor federation, the General
 Union of Tunisian Workers (UGTT), resumed publication of its
 newspaper Ash Sha'ab.
 The Government seized no newspapers or magazines in 1989.
 Distribution of the September 29 issue of the independent
 weekly Le Maghreb was slightly delayed, ostensibly because of
 problems with the printing press used by Le Maghreb. The
 press is owned by the ruling party. The issue appeared with a
 section of an article on a government meeting with An Nahda
 blanked out.- Journalists stated that the blanked-out section
 listed the names of those people who had attended the meeting
 and that the names were deleted owing to government
 intervention."
 Islamist and leftist materials such as books, pamphlets, and
 tapes are available at bookstorbs throughout Tunisia.
 Although the Mufti (official religious leader) of Tunisia
 condemned Salman Rushdie's novel "Satanic Verses", several
 independent periodicals criticized the death sentence
 pronounced on Rushdie by the Government bf Iran.
 The State controls Tunisian television, and its coverag6 of
 the Government is highly favorable. In October several
 opposition.party leaders were able to make unprecedented
 appearances on television. The Italian state channel RAI Uno
 has been available in Tunisia for-many years; in 1989 the
 Tunisian Goverfnent agreed to allow relayed broadcasting of
 the French state Channel 2.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly, and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly, but
 associations and-political parties must apply to the interior
 Ministry for legal authorization to function. Any group
 wishing to hold a public meeting must also make a request to
 the Government a days in advance.
 The law onparties stipulates that every political party must
 reject yiolence in all forms, including fanaticism, racism,
 and other discrimination. No party can claim to represent a
 religion, race, sex, or region. No-party can receive funds
 from a foreign-party or material aid directly or indirectly
 from forzeign countries or foreigners. All adherents to a
 party must have been Tunisian citizens for at least 5 years.
 Having registered three new parties in 1988, the Government
 registered no new parties in 1989. As of the end of the year,
 there were seven legal parties (including the Tunisian
 
 
 1595
 TUNlhISIA
 Communist Party--PCT). Approximately 15 other parties aspired
 to recognition.
 The illegal Islamist party An Nahda, whose candidates averaged
 18 percent of the vote when running as independents in the
 April elections, was refused legal status in June on the
 ostensible grounds that its leaders had criminal records. The
 Government did subsequently invite An Nahda to start up its
 own newspaper.
 There is widespread belief that An Nahda receives funding from
 abroad, in contravention of the law on parties. Moreover,
 An Nahda's political agenda came sharply into question in
 October, when party Secretary General Abdelfattah Mourou
 called for the dismissal of Minister of Higher Education
 Mohamed Charfi on the grounds that Charfi's educational reform
 program is "anti-Islamic and anti-Arab." During the fall
 several Tunisian newspapers which had printed articles
 critical of Islamists reportedly received threats of physical
 retaliation.
 Tunisia's numerous unrecognized parties and associations are
 in the position of breaking the law each time they meet.
 During the summer there was a trend toward tighter control
 over these groups. Khelifa Abid, Secretary General of the new
 Labor and Justice Party, was called before the police twice,
 and the entire political bureau of the Popular Unity Movement
 (MUP) was called in for questioning by the Interior Ministry
 during the summer. Several members of unrecognized opposition
 parties were also reported to have been roughed up, put under
 surveillance, threatened, and in some cases arrested by
 government personnel. In June newspapers reported that 40
 members of An Nahda and 40 members of the more radical
 Islamist Liberation Party (ILP) were arrested and fined for
 illegal distribution of pamphlets.
 Other arrests and sentencing followed. Six members of the
 illegal POCT were arrested in Gafsa and Gabes on charges of
 illegal distribution of pamphlets critical of government
 economic policies. Four were sentenced but subsequently
 'pardoned. Islamists claimed that several of their number were
 arrested in Sfax in September. While well over 100 persons
 appear to-�ave been arrested and questioned during the summer,
 it was not known how many were in prison at-year's end.
 The law governing associations is separate from the law
 -governing parties. The Interior Ministry claimed that over
 - �,000 nongovermenhal -associations were operating legally in
 Tunisia. Under the-law, recognized associations must also
 obtain permissiir to hold meetings. During i989.-a number of
 think tanks and-community organizations were-founded. The
 Association of Democratic Women, an organization previously
 denied legal status, was. also approved.
 -.During 1989 the main student organizations were routinely
 granted permission to hold large rallies andwlections on -
 campuses. Student organizers spoke freely on campuses and
 freely pqsted their views. However, security forces were
 conspicuously present on Tunisian campuses, including at some
 high schools, and there were press reports of arrests of
 members of the Islamist-leaning General Tunisian Student Union
 -(UGTE) during the summer. The UGTE played a major role in
 instigating nationwide student strikes during the fall.
 
 
 1596
 TUNMISIA
 c.- Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution establishes Islam as the state religion, but
 allows the free practice of other'religions. Proselytizing
 for religions other than Islam is prohibited, although no
 specific sanctions are prescribed. The Constitution calls on
 all political parties to respect and defend Tunisia's
 Arab-Muslim identity, and the president and his parents and
 grandparents must be Muslim. The current Government has given
 Islam more prominence in public life than its predecessor did.
 The Government controls the mosques. The State pays for the
 salaries of imams (prayer leaders). According to the 1988 Law
 of the Mosques, only goveknment-appointed personnel can lead
 activities in the mosque, except with permission from the
 Prime Minister's office. The Government sponsors television
 talk shows in support of government religious policy.
 Islamists claimed that about 20 government-appointed imams
 were removed from office in 1989 on suspicion of promoting
 Islamist goals.
 An order from the Prime Minister's office which forbids women
 to wear the "hijeb" style veil (issociated with the Islamist
 movement) was seldom enforced-during 1988 and~most of 1989.
 In September the Higher Education Ministry issued instructions
 that the-order should be more rigorously enforced in high
 schools-. Enforcement of the order was among the stated causes
 of at least one strike by'high school students in 1989. The
 order-was latier rescinded, and ptudents are now free to wear
 the hijeb.,
 Jews comprise the largest religious minority among Tunisians,
 with an aging population of about 2,000. The Government
 assures freedom of worship for the Jewish community and
 provides for the community's safety. However, emigration
 continues even among this small group (there were over 100,000
 Jews in Tunisia at independence in 1956). Despite official
 protection 'for the community, instances of civilian aggression.
 against Jews and Eyn'agogues' led to an uneasy atmosphere 'in
 1989.
 Tunisia' ivery sm all%: Christia' cmmunity, made up. largely of
 expatribtbs, freely attends church ber~ices. Under an
 agreement between the Vatican and the Government, several
 Roman Catholic religious orders remain active. The official
 ban on Baha'i religious meetings, imposed in 1984, is still in
 effect.      -    .      "
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Counhry, Foreign
 Travel, Emigratlon,'and Repatriation
 There is frebdom of movemiit in !Tuni:sia, but all citizens must
 carry identity cards. Roadblocks manned by armed members of
 security forces (as well as by customs officials, especially
 near the brderb with'Libya and Algeria) are common in both
 city and dountry. Some Tunisians complained of being stopped
 arbitrarily and 'harbssed. These roadblocks were set up
 ostensibly in- response'to the large foreign presence in
 Tunisia,-incluaing the" headguarters of 'the Palestine
 Liberation Organizationand the Arab League. Islamists
 reported monitoring of their movements inside the country.
 The withholding of passports continued to be a source of
 concern. The Human Rights League reported that it had filed
 over 100 cases involving suspended passports with the Interior
 
 
 1597
 TUNISIA
 Ministry and said it-was continuing to receive new cases. The
 League noted that the Ministry was promptly and carefully
 reviewing the cases filed hy the League. Those who continued
 to have trouble regaining passports included members of the
 1987 coup plot, as well as others with affiliations to
 unrecognized political parties. The Government did renew the
 passport of Islamist leader Rachid Ghannouchi, who was on an
 extended publicity tour abroad during 1989.
 There is no arbitrary restriction on emigration or
 repatriation. The Government estimated that 406,000 Tunisians
 were working overseas in 1988.
 Section 3 Respect-for Political Rights: -The Right of Citizens
 to-Change Their Government
 Given various continuing restrictions on political activity
 and distortions in the 1989 election process, the right of
 citizens to change their government through democratic means
 remains in doubt. The largest opposition party remains
 illegal.  The Constitution provides for a parliamentary
 democracy with separation- of executive, legislative, and
 judicial powers. -However.,-the legislaturezhas,.limited
 authority. The President appoints the Prime Minister, the
 Cabinet, and the 23 governors. The executive is dominated at
 the-national, regional, and local levels bythe President and
 his party. Government and RCD mechanisms are still virtually
 _inseparable. For instance,.government and RCD offices are
 often in the same place.
 In theeyesLofmany observers, the parliamentary elections in
 April were~flawed. The Human Rights League expressed concern
 -at the absence of almost a third of �he voting-age population
 fromelectoral lists. It deplored obstacles to voter
 registration which it said were intended to make impossible
 -the participation of.some-slates of candidates, as well as
 reports of abuses at the voting booths. Voters chose colored
 ballots from a tablezmanned by l1ocal ruling party members.
 While voters could theoretically have selected all ballots and
 then entered the booth to-vote secretly, the arrangement was
 thought to exert pressure on the voter to take only the red
 ballot of the-ruling RCD. The League called for a revision of
 the electoral code-to guarantee-ef-fective pluralist
 representation. In hismpeech on November-7 to-mark the
 second anniversary ofhis accession~to the presidency,
 Ben Ali rejected the possibility of implementing proportional
 representation.
 Electi-onitdebates were relatively unrestricted, and opposition
 parties were able to hold meetings, put up posters, and
 monitorthfpolls. Some opposition-cndidates spoke .on the
 madio.- Although tie Islamist partykztNahda was denied
 official recognition, Islamist candidates were fielded
 nationwide on-independent tickets;nand other newly legalized
 opposition parties participated in the el-ections.
 .The postelection-rpe-riod.uas marred by the arrest and
 harassment of someopposition figures. The Government
 contimued to -deny official status to the Islamist party
 An Nahda despite the strong showing made in the April
 elections by the members of the party running on independent
 tickets (see also Section 2.b.).
 
 
 1598
 TUNiISIA
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Tunisia is home to several active human rights organizations,
 all of which are recognized by the Government. The Tunisian
 League of Human Rights is one of the oldest human rights
 organizations in the Arab world. Two prominent former members
 of the League serve in the current Government as Minister of
 Health and Minister of Higher Education.
 On March 23, at President Ben Ali's instruction, the
 Government permitted the establishment of a new Arab Institute
 of Human Rights. The Institute is a collabor3tive effort of
 the Hurfan Rights League, the Arab Organization for Human
 Rights, and the Union of Arab Lawyers. A Maghreb Human Rights
 League has also been formed in Tunis.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The 1956 Personal Status Code (PSC) establishes in most
 circumstances equal rights for men and women. Women have
 equal rights in-divorce and child custody. Polygamy is
 forbidden. The Government encourages family planning. Women
 have equal access to education, are free to participate in
 commercial and social activities, and have full legal
 competency, from the age of 20.
 However, in practice women continue to occupy a subordinate
 role in society. Under the PSC, daughters receive a smaller
 portion.of an inheritance than sons. The husband is the head
 of the household, and the wife owes him obedience. Parental
 power and authority are in the hands of the father. Moreover,
 custody cases involving marriages betweeh foreign women and
 Tunisian-men are decided in favor of the father regardless of
 legal decisions made in other countries.
 While .arranged-marriages and marriages between cousins are
 still common, toe~trend seems to be toward greater
 opportunities for..women in-other-areas. According to the 1984
 census,.581pergent of females over.the-age of 10 were
 illiterate compared to. 34.6 percent of males. However, 90'
 percent of girls have reportedly been enrolled in primary
 school since 1987 and secondary and university enrollment is
 currently oyer 40 percent female. The number of employed
 women is increasing at a moderate pace, and in 1989 women made
 up an estimated 20 percent of the work force. Women are most
 fully represented in medicine, journalism, and. teaching.
 Psychologists and doctors who have treated victims of-domestic
 violence note that. both men and women are victims. They
 surmise that-yiolence in rural areas stems from difficult
 livingqondpitions and is-not aimed in particular against
 women. It is difficult to estimate the extent.'of Violence
 against woimen since battery of women is not a public issue in
 Tunisia, and there do not appear.to be support groups or other
 avenues of recourse.-
 Members of the small Jewist.community suffer some forms of
 discrimination;- Generally, Jews do not hold public office or'
 serve in the Interior-Ministry or security services. Some
 Jews who receive foreigners in their homes report having been
 questioned by police about the visits.
 
 
 1599
 There were widespread allegations of discrimination based in
 part on religious sympathies when a number of people the
 Government identified as Islamist sympathizers were removed
 from their civil service jobs or transferred to undesirable
 posts. For example, individuals were removed from positions
 with Customs, the Interior Ministry, the security services,
 and the armed forces. Some Islamist schoolteachers were also
 removed from their schools or posted to remote areas. Twice
 during August, first at the Prime Minister's office and later
 at the presidential palace, about 100 Islamists gathered to
 ask reinstatement in the civil service. Twenty-three who had
 lost their jobs entered the Human Rights League office on
 September 8 to announce a hunger strike. They said they
 represented a total of 350 unemployed Islamists; other
 observers estimated that there may be several thousand people
 in this category. The hunger strike was called off when the
 League agreed to mediate with the Government on the strikers'
 behalf. The Government had not answered the League's
 inquiries by the end of the year.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Tunisia's Constitution stipulates the right to organize a
 union and to strike. The roughly 20 percent of Tunisia's work
 force that is unionized includes most public sector workers
 and those in large private establishments.
 In 1989 the General Union of Tunisian Workers (UGTT), whose
 activities were curtailed in recent years, was able to hold
 elections at the shop and regional level which culminated in
 an extraordinary congress in April 1989. The Congress brought
 a new, more independent leadership to power and was followed
 by the election of new leaders for the 50-odd confederations
 making up the UGTT. In September the Government returned to
 the UGTT assets that had been confiscated in the mid-1980's,
 making the UGTT less dependent on the Government. The UGTT is
 a member of the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions (ICFTU).
 Although the UGTT was able to renew its basic structures,
 trade unionists in Tunisia have yet to regain other elements
 of their right to association. For example, regulations
 dating from a confrontation with the Government in 1985 that
 prohibit labor meetings at the workplace are still enforced.
 Another regulation limits the right to strike by- requiring all
 affected member UGTT unions--not just the members in the
 enterprise to be struck--to approve a strike in advance.
 Partly as a consequence, there have been no sector-wide
 strikes since the mid-1980's. Many short, wildcat strikes
 occur, however, without government interference. The 1989
 report of the ILO Committee of Experts (COE) cited this strike
 authorization procedure, as well as broad government authority
 to impose compulsory arbitration and to requisition workers
 during a strike, as incompatible with the right to strike
 protected by ILO Convention 87 on Freedom of Association.
 The same COE report acknowledged steps taken by the Government
 to conform with Convention 87, including: the reinstatement
 of public sector workers dismissed for union activity; an
 amnesty for persons sentenced for offenses committed while
 members of a union; permitting the convening of congresses on
 the premises of public enterprises in connection with the 1989
 extraordinary congress of the UGTT; authorizing public
 
 
 1600
 TUNISIA
 enterprises to deduct union dues for members of the union; and
 resumption of the dialog between the Government and the
 workers.
 b.-The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Tunisian labor code prohibits the firing of workers for
 union activity. Workers who feel they have been fired or
 otherwise discriminated against for legitimate unionism can
 appeal to the Social Affairs Ministry. At present the
 Ministry is adjudicating at least 158 cases concerning workers
 fired for prounion activity. Most of these cases date from
 the confrontation between the Government and UGTT in 1985.
 Tunisian-workers exercise the right to bargain collectively.
 Most trade unions prefer to negotiate wages at the sectoral
 rather than shop level. Many unionists argue, however, that
 the absence of the automatic "check-off" (requiring all
 workers to pay union dues whether they are union members or
 not, a system which was canceled by the Government in 1983)
 has deprived the UGTT of a vital source of financing to help
 it negotiate forcefully.
 Labor law and practice are uniform throughout the country.
 There are no free trade zones as such.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Compulsory labor is prohibited by law and is not practiced.
 Nevertheless, the COE report cited in Section 6.a. called on
 the Government to fulfill its longstanding commitment to bring
 laws requiringwork "rehabilitation" and compulsory work on
 economic and social development projects into conformity with
 Convention.29,on Forced Labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 For manufacturing, the minimum age for employment is 15 years;
 for agriculture it is 13 years. Inspectors from the Social
 Affairs Ministry check the records of employees to verify that
 the employer complies with the minimum age law. Despite this
 law, young-children often perform agricultural work in rural
 areas and sell food-and other items in urban areas. Small
 enterprises in the informal sector reportedly violate the
 minimum age law frequently.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Tunisia has a labor code dating from independence in 1956 that
 sets standards, including a 48-hour workweek and a minimum
 wage, for some 60-percent of the labor force working in the
 civil service, public sector companies, and professions such
 as teaching. The labor code also serves aS an indirect model
 for the larger private sector companies. Regional labor
 inspectors are responsible for enforcing standards. Most
 firms are Inspected about once a year. However, in general
 the Government does not enforce the minimum wage law,
 particularly in the nonunionized sectors of the economy.
 Moreover, a considerable amount of labox takes place in the
 informal economy. Such labor includes both part-time work in
 occupations covered by the-labor code and activities, such as
 residential construction, falling outside the code's purview.
 Work standards in the informal sector are often below
 government norms.
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 1601
 Employees covered by the minimum wage law are entitled to
 receive other benefits, including social security, disability
 and health insurance, transportation and family allowances,
 and paid leave. Some covered employees, however, are deprived
 of these benefits. The labor code requires employers to pay
 overtime, a-might work differential, and holiday pay. In the
 major urban areas, a minimum wage employee with a family of
 four nets between $170 to $210 per month when allowances are
 Ancluded. In agriculture the base wage is about $3.85 per
 -day, although this directly applies only to 37 percent of the
 agricultural work force and does not cover migrant
 agricultural workers. Supplemented by the benefits listed
 above, the minimum wage is adequate to provide a decent living
 for workers and their families. Over the past several years,
 however, inflation has outstripped increases in the minimum
 wage, thereby eroding the standard of living.
 The Social Affairs Ministry has an office with responsibility
 for improving health and safety standards in the workplace.
 In many hazardous jobs--e.g., mining, petroleum engineering,
 and construction--the Government has established new
 regulations. These regulations -are enforced more strictly in
 Tunis than in the rest of the country, where much work,
 especially in construction, is done in the informal sector.
 It is estimated that there were about 200 work-related deaths
 in 1989.
