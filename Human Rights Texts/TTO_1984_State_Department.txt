 TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
 Trinidad and Tobago has a population of about 1.2 million
 inhabitants, of whom 41 percent each are blacks and East
 Indians. It has the third highest per capita income in the
 Western Hemisphere, and social indicators such as longevity
 and infant mortality are closer to those of the first world
 than those of the third world with which the Government of
 Trinidad and Tobago identifies itself politically. The
 economy is mixed, with a high level of government control, but
 also a well-entrenched right to hold private property and
 pursue private interests.
 Politically, Trindad and Tobago is a Republic with a
 British-style parliamentary system of government. The
 People's National Movement (PNM), traditionally backed by
 blacks and some East Indians, has governed the country since
 1956. This party has won a number of general elections since
 that year, but there have almost always been opposition
 parties contesting the elections. The opposition currently
 controls six of seven county councils as well as the House of
 Assembly on the sister island of Tobago.
 There were no substantial changes in 1984 in Trinidad and
 Tobago's generally good record in human rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no politically motivated killings in 1984.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution forbids such treatment or punishment, and the
 law renders inadmissible in court any evidence obtained by
 such means. There are occasional reports in the media and
 charges in the courts that police have mistreated persons
 under arrest. The law permits victims to sue for damages in
 case of mistreatment. A government-appointed commission has
 recommended measures to upgrade the qualifications of police
 officers and to improve procedures for citizen complaints of
 unlawful police behavior.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Any individual who is arrested may apply for a writ of habeas
 corpus. The police usually charge a suspect within 48 hours
 of arrest, but can obtain a court order to hold a person
 longer in order to get further evidence.In 1984 a court
 ordered compensation of a number of persons who had been
 detained in 1970 for security reasons during a turbulent
 period but before a state of emergency had been invoked.
 Although accused persons may generally be freed on bail
 pending trial, persons accused of murder are ineligible for
 bail under current procedures. A number of persons accused of
 murder have been in prison for. several years awaiting trial.

 e. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 In law and in practice, accused persons are accorded a fair
 and public trial by an independent judiciary, from which
 appeals may be made to the Court of Appeals and to the Privy
 Council in London. The judiciary and legal system are
 understaffed and overworked, and there have been long delays
 in bringing some accused persons to trial. There are no
 political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution and laws prohibit such arbitrary
 interference, and these prohibitions are generally respected
 in practice. There is a dispute over whether the State has
 the right to remove commercial or residential structures on
 public lands, but such issues are settled by the courts.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The constitutional right of freedom of expression is protected
 and enhanced by the independent judiciary, by the country's
 democratic and pluralistic system, and by privately owned
 print media. Government-owned Trinidad and Tobago Television
 (TTT) enjoys a monopoly on local television transmission, and
 its coverage tends to support the Government.
 In January 1983 the Director of TTT was fired. The press
 reported that one reason for his dismissal was his refusal to
 fire a reporter who was thought to be opposed to the ruling
 party. But since then, under the new Director, there has been
 an improvement in the objectivity and comprehensiveness of
 TTT's news coverage.
 The Government has failed to act on a long-standing
 application of a number of businessmen to launch a private
 television station. The Government has also taken no action
 on a private application to launch a radio station which was
 submitted several years ago. The applicant in this case has
 taken the Government to court. Of the two radio stations
 currently in operation, one is governmdnt-owned and the other
 is private but government-licensed. The private station's
 license has expired, and the Government is taking no action to
 renew it. Both radio stations are cautious about broadcasting
 calypso songs which are harshly critical of the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are protected by law and are respected in
 practice. Permits for street meetings, marches, or other
 demonstrations are required in advance but are normally
 granted even to critics of the Government.
 The right of workers to organize and bargain collectively is
 protected by law, and about 30 percent of the work force is
 organized into trade unions. The Ministry of Labor acts as an
 impartial conciliator in collective bargaining impasses.
 Unions may strike and employers may respond with a lock-out if
 the Ministry is unsuccessful in resolving the labor dispute
 and so certifies the dispute to the Industrial Court. The
 Industrial Court is empowered to impose a binding settlement
 on the parties; In 1984, union leaders complained that the
 
 
 684
 TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
 Ministry and the Court in effect supported the employers in
 pursuit of the Government's policy of wage restraint. Unions
 and professional associations maintain relations with
 international bodies.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The right to practice one's religion is guaranteed by the
 Constitution and respected in practice. There is no state
 religion. Missionaries and clergy are generally permitted to
 enter Trinidad and Tobago to proselytize or to serve their
 co-religionists. Adherents of both the Hindu and Muslim faith
 occasionally claim that the Government has discriminated in
 favor of missionaries sponsored by the other. There is no
 religious test for public office.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 This freedom is fully respected. Many thousands of citizens
 have emigrated, particularly to the United States, Canada, and
 the United Kingdom, in search of better economic
 opportunities, and many thousands from Caribbean Commonwealth
 countries such as Grenada, St. Vincent, St. Lucia, and Guyana
 have immigrated to Trinidad and Tobago for the same reason.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The people of Trinidad and Tobago choose their government by
 electing a House of Representatives in multi-party elections
 held at least every five years. The leader of the party which
 wins a majority of seats is appointed Prime Minister by the
 President, and then forms a government. The individual able
 to get the support of the majority of members of parliament
 not supporting the Government is named leader of the
 opposition. The leader of the opposition has the right to be
 consulted by the President on appointments, including those to
 the Elections and Boundaries Commission which draws
 constituency boundaries and conducts elections. There are
 credible opposition allegations that the nominally independent
 Commission has actually supported the PNM in the past by
 gerrymandering constituencies in its favor. The PNM has won
 all elections since 1956, but its victories can be principally
 attributed to its political skills and to divisions among the
 opposition. The Constitution permits Commonwealth citizens
 who are legal residents and 18 years of age and older to
 vote. The Government has in the past obtained electoral
 support from Commonwealth Caribbean citizens who have
 immigrated and become legal residents of Trinidad and Tobago.
 The PNM has historically obtained support from lower-middle
 and working-class blacks and Christian and Muslim East
 Indians. The opposition has drawn support from rural Hindus,
 Tobagonians, and middle and upper-class people of various
 ethnic groups.
 In the recent Tobago House of Assembly elections, the
 opposition Democratic Action Congress won 11 of the 12 seats.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Trinidad and Tobago has not been the subject of international
 human rights investigations. In addition to the judiciary,
 where claims of human rights violations are actionable, there
 is'an Ombudsman who can investigate alleged violations of
 citizens' rights in the application of a law or policy and
 report the findings to Parliament. Trinidad and Tobago has a
 local bureau of human rights issues, as well as a local branch
 of Amnesty International. In its 1983 report, Freedom House
 rated the country *free.* Amnesty International Report 1984
 did not comment on Trinidad and Tobago.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Because of its oil revenues, in the past decade Trinidad and
 Tobago attained a per capita gross national product of $6,919
 (1982), highest in the Western Hemisphere after the United
 States and Canada. The population of 1.2 million inhabitants
 has a growth rate of 1.5 percent a year; life expectancy at
 birth is 69.9 years, and infant mortality was 21.5 per
 thousand live births. Education and literacy are nearly
 universal. In 1970, adult literacy was 92.2 percent (male
 94.7, female 89.7) and in 1977 primary school enrollment was
 111.09 percent.
 Further indications of the standard of living are the 93
 percent of the population with access to safe water in 1975
 (urban 79, rural 100), and the 111.6 percent of caloric supply
 available for consumption relative to nutritional requirements
 as of 1977.
 Women enjoy equality under the law. Many have positions in
 the Government, civil service, political party leadership,
 business, and other professions, although their presence in
 these positions is not in proportion to their numbers in the
 population. Women currently serve in Parliament and women's
 groups are quick to speak out on women's rights.
 Within the Indian community, signs of the Hindu caste system
 remain. Blacks believe they are not treated as well as-whites
 and those of mixed blood. Individual Tobagonians enjoy
 equality of treatment but believe that Tobago itself receives
 far less development money than Trinidad. These individuals
 perceive these conditions as limiting social and economic
 opportunities available to them.
 In Trinidad, opposition supporters say that areas which
 historically have supported the ruling party have more and
 better roads, telephones, and schools than those backing
 opposition parties. A government minister drew criticism
 during a local election campaign when he implied that the
 Government would deliberately follow such a policy in the
 future.
