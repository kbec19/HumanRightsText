 SIERRA LEONE
 
 Established at the end of the eighteenth century as a
 private colony for freed slaves, Freetown became a British
 Crown Colony in 1808. Subsequently, in 1896, the British
 Government placed the rest of what is now Sierra Leone under
 its protection. For most of the pre-independence period
 Sierra Leone remained two entities, a colony and a protectorate.
 The colony was endowed with schools, as well as the first
 institution of higher learning in British West Africa (1827)
 and it produced in the nineteenth century a local educated
 elite that included lawyers, doctors, and ministers. The
 protectorate fared less well. It is only since independence
 in 1960 that education has become reasonably available
 throughout the country. Tribal and sectional rivalries have
 been the prime cause of past political difficulties and are
 the rationale for the establishment of the one-party state in
 June 1978. The single party, the All-People's Congress (APC),
 has sought to enlarge its base and to encompass previous
 opposition leaders, some of whom have been given significant-
 government and Party positions.
 Sierra Leone is a poor country with an annual per capita GNP
 of less than $200. The economy has stagnated in recent years,
 the result of declining mineral production and an historic
 neglect of agriculture. In late 1978 and early 1979 adverse
 weather interfered with the production of rice, the country's
 staple food, and much of Sierra Leone's meager foreign exchange
 earnings have had to be used for rice imports. While the
 government's top priority in recent years had been on agricul-
 tural development, it is now concentrating on infrastructure
 development, such as hotels, airports, roads, and the like, in
 preparation for the July 1980 Organization of African Unity
 Heads of State Conference which will be held in Freetown.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 There is no evidence of the use of torture in Sierra Leone.
 It is prohibited by the Constitution.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been no reports of cruel, inhuman or degrading
 treatment or punishment. The Constitution prohibits "any
 punishment or other treatment which is inhuman or degrading."
 As far as is known, health care is acceptable and prisoners
 are allowed family visits and may choose attorneys of their
 choice.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Under the 1978 Constitution the President may take measures
 to detain any person who is, or is reasonably suspected to
 be, dangerous to the well being of the Republic, provided that
 a State of Public Emergency has come into force within 28 days
 after the detention. Otherwise, a detainee not charged with
 
 (172)
 
 
 173
 an offense must be released, unless he is held under the
 President's exceptional unlimited powers. There is no
 available evidence that anyone is so detained at present.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 All persons charged with a criminal offense are entitled
 to a fair hearing within a reasonable time by an independent
 and impartial court established by law. Sierra Leone's
 courts have a good reputation for providing fair public
 trials. Persons detained under the Public Emergency Act
 are not guaranteed a fair hearing unless charged with a
 criminal offense, however, and their acquittal after usual
 constitutional procedures does not ensure release from
 detention.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 There are effective legal safeguards,which are observed,
 against arbitrary invasion of the home.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The 1974-79 National Development Plan calls for improved
 welfare for the broad mass of the population and a more
 equitable distribution of income. In 1978-79 planned
 development spending accounted for 24 percent of the total
 government budget. Few figures are available for 1979-80
 because of the government's concentration on preparations for
 .the 1980 OAU Conference scheduled for Freetown. Corruption
 is widespread in Sierra Leone and has diverted significant
 resources from vital needs and development.
 The income tax is progressive, but export duties are regres-
 sive. In early 1979, however, the 40 percent export tax on
 agricultural crops was reduced to 15 percent in order to
 alleviate the small farmers' burden. In mid 1979, as part of
 the government's new agreement with the International Monetary
 Fund to try to stabilize the faltering economy, Sierra Leone
 was obliged to increase the export tax once again, this time
 to 35 percent.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Freedom of religion is observed and constitutionally guar-
 anteed. The government makes no effort to impose ideological
 conformity or to restrict intellectual inquiry. Freedom of
 speech is legally guaranteed, but under the 1978 Constitution
 this freedom can be abridged if the proper functioning of the
 recognized party (the APC) is deemed in jeopardy. Freedom
 of Assembly is legally protected, but under the Constitution
 this freedom can easily be restricted in the interest of
 party discipline. There is no opposition and thus no
 opposition press per se but there are a few poorly printed
 
 
 174
 newspapers some of which, while treating the government
 respectfully, print stories that do not appear in the govern-
 ment media. In late 1979 the government introduced into
 Parliament a press registration bill that would impose a
 large annual registration fee and would make the Minister of
 Information the sole arbiter of disputes about publication
 without apparent recourse to the courts.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no official restrictions on travel within the
 country, except those to control smuggling in diamond
 mining areas of Kono District. Regulations governing
 foreign travel are liberal, and there are minimal legal
 restrictions on emigration.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Sierra Leone received independence in 1961 as a parliamentary
 democracy, and was at first hailed as an example of a working
 democracy in Africa. Political development was arrested
 after 1967 by a series of military interventions and attempts
 at intervention in the political process. Since then there
 have been no contested elections, and the APC, which was
 given power by the military in 1968, has monopolized political
 activity. In 1978 it declared itself the sole legal political
 party. Participation in the political system is limited to
 the APC Party, but membership is encouraged and open to all.
 There is no legal discrimination based on ethnic, communal,
 racial or caste factors. The status of women varies greatly
 from the modern sector where women occupy such posts as
 Mayor of Freetown and Supreme Court Justice, to a traditional-
 ly subordinate role in remote regions. Increasing attention
 is being paid to the role of women in both political and
 professional activities.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 To the knowledge of the Department of State, there were no
 requests in 1979 for outside investigations.
