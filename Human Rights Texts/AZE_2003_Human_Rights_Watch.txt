AZERBAIJAN
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
The government resumed its practice of attempting to suppress public expression
of social discontent without alienating the Council of Europe and other international
partners. This balancing act broke down on June 4, when police opened
fire on demonstrators in the village ofNardaran, killing one. International criticism of Azerbaijan peaked in September, after the government staged a referendum that
was clearly aimed at ensuring that eighty-year-old President Heidar Aliev could
appoint his son as acting president should he step down.
The government moved forward in adopting reform legislation, such as that
introducing an ombudsman institution and ratifying the European Convention on
Human Rights. But its continued poor human rights practices—the continued
detention of political prisoners, harassment of independent media, and repression
of social and political movements—drew criticism, particularly from the Parliamentary
Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE).A September PACE resolution
stated that it was “disturbed and shocked”by violations of basic freedoms.The government
tried unsuccessfully to bully the PACE by demanding—unsuccessfully—
that one of the PACE Monitoring Committee’s rapporteurs assigned to monitor
Azerbaijan be replaced.
On June 4, police killed one and wounded dozens of others while attempting to
quell demonstrations in Nardaran, about twenty-five kilometers north of Baku, the
capital. The shooting culminated months of public discontent over deteriorating
social and economic conditions in the village. Significantly, protesters had not been
deterred by the example the government had set in 2000 and 2001, when in Baku
and several provincial towns it used force to disperse protesters calling attention to
social issues, and prosecuted individual protesters. In January (shortly after a stinging
PACE resolution), the government responded to public demands by improving
the electricity supply and public transportation, and by promising new jobs. But
public trust crumbled in May, and the town elders led more protests, driving Nardaran’s
Baku-appointed mayor out of office.
On the morning of June 3 the authorities arrested eight Nardaran elders they
had invited to discuss the appointment of a new mayor and simultaneously sent a
large detachment of police and Interior Ministry troops into Nardaran. In the
evening security forces exchanged blows with a large crowd that had gathered on
Nardaran’s main square to protest the detentions. Reportedly, they attacked
demonstrators with truncheons, and the latter threw stones. Security forces fired
automatic weapons as a means of crowd control. One demonstrator was killed, a
dozen sustained serious bullet wounds, and fifty more reportedly suffered minor
bullet injuries. The security forces withdrew, making apparently random arrests as
they quit Nardaran.
Instead of acting to calm the situation, the government issued a statement on
June 5 that blamed all violence on the demonstrators, claiming that they had
opened fire on the police, and failed to acknowledge any use whatsoever of firearms
by the security forces.
In the following weeks, security forces controlled movement to and from the village,
but rarely ventured in. Several waves of further arrests, primarily outside the
town, inhibited Nardaran men from leaving its bounds. On July 29 police allegedly
detained Vasif Aliev as a hostage, to induce his father, a protester, to give himself up.
On September 20, plainclothes officers arrested Nardaran elder Jebrail Alizade and
members of his family.His son alleged that officers secured Alizade’s compliance by
putting a pistol to the temple of his five-year-old grandson. The authorities held
two to three dozen arrested men from Nardaran in incommunicado detention for various periods. Several of them on release claimed they had been tortured. As of
October, fifteen remained in detention.
Nardaran has a reputation for devout religiosity, and the authorities in retrospect
claimed the protests were the first step in a foreign-backed bid by Islamic
“radicals” to take over the country. The government adamantly dismissed social
and economic deprivation as its driving factor.
During the year the government acted against several manifestations of Islam
that fell beyond its control, restricting some independent mosques and impounding
imported religious literature.The Interior Ministry refused identity documents
to Muslim women who insisted on being photographed in headscarves
Nontraditional Christian groups also came under pressure. In October, the head
of the State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations announced his
intention to revoke registration of the Jehovah’s Witnesses.
On November 15, 2001,Baku police beat and detained journalists protesting the
banning of Milletin Sesi (The People’s Voice) and Bakinskii Bulvar (Baku Boulevard)
newspapers. A month later President Aliev held a roundtable with representatives
of the opposition and independent media, and subsequently the
government eased restrictions and pressure on such outlets by allowing some
regional television stations to resume broadcasts and improving economic conditions
for newspapers.
The respite, however, was short-lived. Punitive libel prosecutions of newspapers
and journalists continued. The long-banned magazine Monitor, after briefly
resuming publication in April, was immediately sued by the Defense Ministry and
denied further printing by its printing press. Journalists who investigated alleged
abuses by the customs service risked physical reprisals. The authorities continued
to tear down kiosks run by Gaia, a private newspaper distribution company, eliminating
outlets for independent press in the regions.After protests from newspaper
editors,Aliev softened some provisions of a draconian September decree that made
editors responsible for preserving state secrets,which a flawed 1996 state secrets law
allowed the government to define arbitrarily.
With President Aliev determining to stand in presidential elections slated for the
end of 2003, on August 24 the government staged a referendum on constitutional
changes.The referendum proposed changes that would give President Aliev the discretion
to appoint his son Ilham as acting president should he step down, and that
would scrap parliamentary mandates based on proportional representation in
favor of single mandate constituencies.Few in Azerbaijan or the international community
took at face value government statements that the referendum aimed to
bring the constitution into line with Azerbaijan’s Council of Europe commitments.
The referendum passed,with more than 96 percent approval, as the government
employed massive fraud and intimidation and ignored opposition boycotts and
objections from the international community. Government claims of 88 percent
voter turnout defied both feasibility and the headcounts by independent and opposition
observers, who concluded that less than 30 percent of the electorate participated.
Pressure for a yes vote was applied through the ranks and dependent
relationships of Azerbaijan’s large state sector, particularly the education system.
There were many reports of falsified votes and arrests and intimidation of polling station commission members and opposition observers who refused to acquiesce
in ballot stuffing.
The change in the future distribution of parliamentary seats threatened to
exclude opposition parties from Azerbaijan’s political system. The referendum galvanized
support for a newly united group of opposition parties, which had called
for a boycott of the vote and mustered tens of thousands at protest rallies held in
Baku in September and October.
In October the pro-government parliamentary majority threatened to legislate
new restrictions upon opposition parties and their newspapers, and the education
minister warned teachers and students not to participate in opposition rallies.During
the year, on several occasions police arrested opposition party activists prior to
rallies, securing their detention for five to fifteen days for alleged public order misdemeanors.
In February and April respectively the authorities forcibly broke up rallies in
Sumgait staged by the opposition Azerbaijan Democratic Party and the Musavat
(Equality) party. In September 2001 authorities had detained three local leaders of
the Adalat (Justice) party; on February 9 they released two, shortly after the third
had died in custody.
In September, five supporters of former President Aiaz Mutalibov were handed
prison sentences of five to ten years, for allegedly plotting a coup, a charge for which
the authorities presented little evidence.
As of this writing hundreds of men whom Azerbaijani human rights groups
considered to be political prisoners remained in prison, although several presidential
mass pardons during the year had reduced their numbers.After demands from
the Council of Europe,prominent prisoners Rahim Gaziev, Iskender Hamidov, and
Alikram Gummatov were granted retrials, yet the authorities conducted them
inside prisons, and with procedural violations (the retrials were ongoing at this
writing).
Azerbaijan reported 10 percent growth in gross domestic product, but few benefited
from it, due to extensive official corruption and to monopoly control by the
ruling party of the most profitable sectors of the state economy.
Conscripts were the targets of economic exploitation in the army.Defense Ministry
officials levied informal charges for draft exemptions, deferrals, or deployments
to units in the least risky areas. In some units officers siphoned off supplies
or surreptitiously used conscripts as unpaid laborers on construction projects.
Eight conscripts died in one July week alone, from sunstroke.
In June the government allocated U.S.$75 million from the State Oil Fund to
build housing for the population of five camps for refugees and internally displaced
persons, and began providing microcredit to internally displaced persons from a
World Bank loan. This signaled a welcome change in the government’s treatment
of people displaced since 1993-4 from territories overrun by Karabakh-Armenian
and Republic of Armenia forces.Many observers had criticized the government for
failing to integrate the half million internally displaced into local economies and
communities.
Nonetheless, there were instances when local authorities grossly abused groups
of displaced persons. At the end of May, two hundred riot police and a demolition crew were sent to a settlement near Lake Ganli Gel outside Baku, where, in several
incidents over three days,police beat several women and bulldozed seventeen of the
sixty-two houses built there by internally displaced persons since 1995. In the
exclave of Nakhchivan, the regional authorities reportedly mounted an intimidation
campaign in late 2001 to force displaced persons to return to insecure border
villages near Sadarak, which were now overlooked by Armenian army posts.
The government refused to recognize as refugees up to ten thousand people who
had fled the war in Chechnya. It did not provide for them, admit their children to
schools, or prevent their harassment by police.The government also complied with
Russia’s requests for the extradition of some Chechens,without considering threats
to their life and safety in Chechnya.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
In the absence of an impartial official inquiry a group of human rights nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs) conducted and published their own detailed
investigation into the Nardaran violence of June 3. The authorities responded by
issuing an official warning to the NGO commission’s forensic specialist Ilgar Altai,
on the pretext that the commission was prejudicing the official investigation.
Regressive amendments to the law on grants passed in June spurred protests
from NGOs, international donor organizations, and the diplomatic community.
The amendments made NGOs’ receipt of donor funds contingent on the approval
of local executive authorities, and subject to registration.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
Council of Europe
The Council of Europe became an increasingly effective source of pressure for
human rights improvement. Successive PACE resolutions provided a framework
for legislative and institutional reform,while the PACE also insisted on implementation
of existing legislation, particularly in its strongly-worded September resolution.
The PACE correctly resisted pressure from the Azerbaijani delegation for the
removal of one of its rapporteurs on Azerbaijan’s implementation of its Council of
Europe human rights obligations.
The PACE’s Committee on Migration, Refugees and Demography’s June report
on the situation of refugees and displaced persons in the South Caucasus, and the
comments of Council of Europe Human Rights Commissioner Alvaro Gil-Robles
during his September visit to Azerbaijan conveyed to the government that it had a
responsibility to elaborate and implement durable solutions including integration
for its internally displaced without further delay, and to refrain from using them as
an argument for political aims.
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Office in
Baku organized roundtables and sponsored a series of television and radio broadcasts
on the upcoming August referendum, on human rights themes, and on
reform of the electoral code, thereby creating frameworks and channels for public
engagement and debate, particularly between the government and opposition, that
were otherwise absent.
In a public statement the office declared that the authorities’ conduct of the constitutional
referendum failed the “credibility test,” accused the Central Election
Commission of “creat[ing] obstacles to wider observation and transparency of the
process” and observed that reports of fraud and intimidation were too numerous
and from such a wide variety of sources to be dismissed.
United States
The State Department’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2001,
published in March, stated that the Azerbaijani government’s human rights record
“remained poor,” and that it “continued to restrict citizens’ ability to change their
government peacefully.” In its International Religious Freedom Report 2002, the
State Department noted that the authorities harassed and abused some Muslim
groups due to concern about their possible links to terrorism.
However, the U.S. government allowed the effect of these criticisms to be undercut
as it consolidated partnership with the Azerbaijani government in energy projects
and the war against terrorism.
