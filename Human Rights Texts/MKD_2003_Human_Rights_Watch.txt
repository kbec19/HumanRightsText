MACEDONIA
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Implementation of the August 2001 Framework Agreement for Peace (known as
the Ohrid Agreement) brought Macedonia considerable change, including an
amnesty for the insurgents, emergence of new political parties, and general elections
that replaced the government of Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski.Reforms
required by the peace agreement began in earnest only in late 2001 with Parliament’s
approval of constitutional amendments recognizing Albanian as an official
language and guaranteeing proportional access for ethnic minorities to public sector
jobs, including in the police. Parliament adopted a further set of reforms giving
ethnic Albanians and other minorities the right to use their own languages in state
institutions.However, prior to its departure from office, doubts about the commitment
of Georgievski’s government to the Ohrid process affected overall stability for
much of 2002, and the government’s record was marred by its assaults on press freedom,
harassment of human rights organizations, impunity for abuses committed
during the conflict, and evidence of widespread corruption.
Although generally declining during the year, there was an upsurge in inter-ethnic
and political violence and intimidation in the weeks preceding the mid-September
2002 general elections, underscoring the fragility of the peace deal. The
elections took place with few incidents, however, and resulted in the “Together for
Macedonia” coalition ousting the ruling parties. Led by the Social Democratic
Union’s Branko Crvenkovski, the coalition took 40.4 percent of the national vote,
while the recently established Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), led by former
Albanian rebel leader Ali Ahmeti,won the bulk of the ethnic Albanian vote. In
early November, Parliament approved the new multiethnic government, headed by
Crvenkovski and including five DUI cabinet members.
Mutual distrust still permeated relations in some communities, strained further
by several isolated but serious attacks. Shootings, bombings, and kidnappings took
place during the year, in particular in the northwest. One of the more serious incidents
occurred in late August, when ethnic Albanian extremists kidnapped seven
people, demanding the release of three suspects in the killing of two policemen that
same week. Due to intervention by international mediators, all seven abductees
were freed within a few days.
Macedonia’s record on accountability for rights abuses remained poor,with the
Georgievski government failing to address impunity for abuses committed during
the 2001 conflict. The authorities flatly rejected the possibility that members of the
security forces could be tried for serious violations of international humanitarian
law. Meanwhile, in March, Parliament passed an amnesty law that covered all
“criminal acts related to the 2001 conflict,” including those committed by combatants
of the ethnic Albanian insurgent group, the National Liberation Army (NLA). 
Most ethnic Albanians detained or convicted on charges related to the conflict were either pardoned by President Boris Trajkovski or released under the amnesty. The
international community gave strong support to the amnesty, which they saw as
important for inter-ethnic peace and reconciliation. However, the law barred
domestic courts from trying war crimes committed during the conflict, and therefore
appeared to violate Macedonia’s obligations under the Geneva Conventions.
Human rights groups argued that the law’s prohibition on domestic trials would
ensure impunity for many serious violations, since the International Criminal Tribunal
for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) would be able to pursue only a few high
profile cases.
Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks against the United States, the
Macedonian government repeatedly used anti-terrorist rhetoric, invented threats
to score political points, and raised the specter of Islamic fundamentalism among
Macedonia’s Albanians. After police shot and killed seven foreign men on the outskirts
of Skopje in March, the government cast the incident as a thwarted “terrorist
attack”on Western embassies in the capital.The Ministry of the Interior attempted
to link the men with the NLA and al-Qaeda, and called them “mujahideen” fighters.
Suspicions emerged when official versions of the incident changed, and the
ministry rejected a request for international forensic experts to examine the bodies.
The Wall Street Journal later reported that the victims were Pakistani and Indian
migrants traveling to Greece to seek employment. The government continued,
however, to label them “terrorists.”
During the year, journalists suffered threats and violent attacks, including a September
9 shooting in the Global newspaper’s printing offices and the bombing of
the newspaper editor’s car a day later.Macedonia’s first newspaper printed in both
Macedonian and Albanian, Global had reported on corruption and incompetence
among government officials. No one was injured in either attack, which editor
Ljupco Palevski attributed to members of the Democratic Party of Albanians, an
allegation that was denied by a party spokesman. Also in September, the Ministry
of the Interior filed criminal libel charges against reporter Marjan Djurovski of
Start magazine, which had published an article claiming the government might
start a war in order to delay elections. Earlier that month, Interior Minister Ljube
Boskovski had threatened to detain any editors for “spreading western scenarios in
order to destroy the government.” Other journalists were physically attacked in
what they believed to be attempts to suppress their investigations into shady government
practices. One of the most serious incidents took place in late September
when persons suspected of being members of the “Lions,” a special police force,
attacked journalist Zoran Bozinovski late at night in the Tumba radio station.Bozinovski
sustained a concussion, lacerations to the head, and several broken fingers.
One person was subsequently arrested for his part in the attack. Investigation of the
perpetrators was ongoing at the time of writing.
Police continued to perpetrate racially motivated abuses against Roma with
impunity, and there were several reports of violent attacks against Roma by nonstate
actors. Discrimination against Roma in various fields of public life remained
widespread. Refugee Roma from Kosovo were particularly vulnerable to abuse.
The government took steps against trafficking in human beings by passing a law
criminalizing trafficking and signing an agreement with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) for the pre-screening of female undocumented
migrants to identify victims of trafficking. The Ministry of the Interior opened a
shelter for trafficked women and girls,which reportedly provided good accommodation
but no information to the women on their legal rights. In addition, the shelter
received only those willing to return to their country of origin. Those who did
not participate in the IOM program were liable to deportation and renewed exposure
to the trafficking cycle.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
The Macedonian Helsinki Committee (MHC) and other organizations became
targets of government-orchestrated intimidation campaigns. The publication of
MHC’s 2001 annual report, which included accounts of violations by the Macedonian
police, triggered accusations of treason and lack of patriotism by the government-
controlled media. A statement from the Ministry of the Interior labeled
Mirjana Najcevska, the MHC chairperson,“state enemy no.1” and “anti-Macedonian.”
In September,Najcevska was also verbally attacked by Minister of the Interior
Boskovski following an MHC statement expressing doubts about the political
impartiality of the police.Boskovski launched a similar smear campaign against the
Brussels-based International Crisis Group and the author of its report on official
corruption in Macedonia.
The Civil Society Resource Center (CSRC) provided free legal representation to
150 asylum seekers, including in three cases before the European Court of Human
Rights. It also provided legal aid to victims of torture, police abuse, and other
human rights violations. A network of nongovernmental organizations coordinated
by the CSRC worked with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees to find solutions to the situation of thousands of former
Yugoslav citizens (including many ethnic Albanians) who had not been granted
Macedonian citizenship after independence, despite their established residence in
the country.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
The international community continued to monitor closely and react to threats
to peace and stability in Macedonia. Unfortunately, considering only short-term
security, it repeatedly sacrificed justice and accountability for the serious crimes
committed by both sides in the armed conflict. The international community
should have supported and monitored fair domestic war crimes trials in Macedonia,
as a complement to international justice before the ICTY.
United Nations
In late 2001, the ICTY initiated two separate war crimes investigations into the
Macedonian conflict and in 2002 opened three new investigations. The ICTY had
not issued any public indictments as of this writing.
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) supported
reforms required by the Ohrid Agreement. The organization trained a multiethnic
police force: as of mid-year, over six hundred police cadets had completed basic
training under the program. The OSCE’s Skopje mission was reportedly taking
steps to enhance its limited human rights monitoring capacity. In the largest election
observation mission ever deployed in Europe, the OSCE sent approximately
eight hundred international observers to Macedonia for the September 15 elections.
The observers judged the elections to be largely free and fair.
Council of Europe
The Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) visited Macedonia in July
to assess the treatment of persons detained by law enforcement agencies. The
country also remained subject to the Parliamentary Assembly’s post-monitoring
dialogue and a delegation of parliamentarians visited the country ahead of the September
elections. In contrast to the majority of international bodies, the Council of
Europe expressed reservations about the amnesty law, noting that an amnesty preventing
domestic prosecutions for violations of international humanitarian law
would be counter-productive.As of this writing, the Macedonian government was
almost four years overdue in submitting its initial report under the Framework
Convention for the Protection of National Minorities.
European Union
The E.U. was supportive of the reform process but expressed concern at the preelection
violence. The E.U. warned the Macedonian government that the increased
violence cast doubts on Macedonia’s ability to form closer ties with the E.U. and the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). A Û530,000 (U.S.$520,000) grant
from the European Commission supported a national census sought particularly
by ethnic Albanian political leaders, who claimed government figures understated
the real size of their community. Resolving this long-standing controversy was a
critical element of the Ohrid Agreement, providing for the proportional representation
of minorities in public administration and other areas of public life. Disagreements
between Greece and Turkey continued to delay the establishment of the
E.U.’s European Rapid Reaction Force (ERRF) and thus postponed the ERRF taking
over the Macedonian mission from NATO. An April report on Macedonia’s
implementation of its commitments under the Stabilization and Association
Agreement with the E.U. listed several human rights concerns. Among “key areas
needing attention in the next twelve months,” the report identified improved
implementation of the Ohrid Agreement, including the census; stronger legal and
constitutional guarantees on free expression; intensified police training in human
rights; and promotion of civil society.
United States
The U.S. government supported the reforms enacted pursuant to the Ohrid
Agreement, particularly the return of multiethnic police to former conflict areas
and the passing of a new local government law. The U.S. also resumed its bilateral
multiethnic police training program in the country. In the aftermath of September
11, the U.S. special envoy to Macedonia warned the authorities not to exploit international
anti-terrorism efforts in order to renege on their Ohrid commitments.
The U.S. State Department’s 2002 trafficking in persons report moved the country
from a Tier Two standing to Tier One,denoting general compliance with minimum
standards for the elimination of trafficking.
