 THE NETHERLANDS
 The Netherlands is a parliamentary democracy under a
 constitutional monarchy. Its political system allows the
 maximum expression of diversity of opinion consistent with
 public order. Its socio-economic system is structured to
 provide a relatively high level of health and educational
 benefits and to redistribute national income significantly.
 The Dutch observance of internationally recognized human
 rights is based on deep-seated and widely-shared concepts
 of human dignity and respect for law. The Netherlands has
 a long and consistent tradition of respect for human rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 Killing for political motives by government or domestic
 opposition political groups does not occur in the
 Netherlands. However, incidents involving Irish and
 Moluccan terrorists have taken place in the recent past in
 the Netherlands.
 b. Disappearance
 Abductions, secret arrests, and clandestine detention by
 police or other official security forces do not occur.
 c. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 Prison conditions and places of detention are adequate, and
 no differentiation of treatment of prisoners is made by
 type of conviction, social class, race, sex, or religion.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice. No persons
 presently are detained in disregard of established
 principles. The equivalent of the right of habeas corpus
 exists in practice. Preventive detention is not permitted
 except in time of emergency, which may be declared for a
 limited duration by national or municipal authorities.
 Municipal authorities in the past have declared such
 emergencies in instances when disorderly demonstrations
 have been perceived to threaten the public welfare.
 Normally, however, a suspect can be held without charge no
 more than six hours.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Defendants have the right to
 effective counsel. Charges must be formally and clearly
 
 
 956
 stated. The judiciary is independent of the executive and
 the military. There is a functioning appeals process, with
 final decisions made by the Supreme Court.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. A formal search warrant issued by a
 magistrate is required to enter a private residence. The
 Government does not engage in violations of the home.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are in effect. There is no
 system of censorship. The press is privately-owned and
 independent-. The two domestic television channels are
 government owned and broadcast time is allocated to private
 broadcasting societies. Opposition viewpoints are freely
 aired.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right to public meetings and free assembly is not
 restricted. There is an active trade union movement, with
 nearly a century of tradition, which has the legal right to
 strike. The rights of unions to organize and to bargain
 collectively are well established and protected under law.
 They also lobby effectively in Parliament and with the
 Government.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is full freedom of religion, which is a
 centuries-old, well-established tradition in the
 Netherlands.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is freedom of domestic and foreign travel,
 emigration, and repatriation in the Netherlands.
 Restrictions are not placed on residence. The Netherlands
 also has provided a home for 24,000 exiles and refugees
 since World War II. During 1981, nearly 1,500 refugees
 were admitted, the majority of whom are Vietnamese., A
 well-organized system of welcome, orientation, and
 assistance exists to facilitate their integration into
 Dutch society. The Dutch traditionally have regarded their
 country as a haven for refugees, political exiles, and
 displaced persons.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political life is carried out in a highly democratic
 fashion. The political opposition is alive, well, and
 active. Elections are free. There are over 20 political
 parties, 12 of which are represented in Parliament.
 Political participation in terms of voter turnout is high.
 Women enjoy the same political rights as men and are
 increasingly active participants in political life.

 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The issue of outside investigation has not arisen with
 regard to human rights in the Netherlands. In addition to
 national offices of Amnesty International and the
 International Commission of Jurists, there are in the
 Netherlands approximately a dozen permanent organizations
 monitoring human rights, many of which receive government
 assistance in one form or another. The Netherlands
 Government is active in the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission and in other organs of the United Nations.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The Netherlands enjoys a high per capita income (about
 $10,000) -- and is an affluent country. The Government
 pursues policies designed to ensure a relatively equitable
 distribution of income throughout the economy. There is
 little class distinction. Population growth in the
 Netherlands is less than one percent annually. The total
 fertility rate is 1.6 children per family (1979).
 Extensive welfare programs assure adequate health care and
 shelter for those with low incomes. The life expectancy
 at birth is 75 years, and the infant mortality rate is 8.5
 per 1000 live births. The economy remains strongly
 capitalist, although with substantial intervention by the
 Government for the purpose of redistributing income. A
 common education system serves all economic levels.
 Education is required up to age 16 and is free to age 18.
 The literacy rate in the Netherlands is 99 percent.
 The right to own property alone and in association with
 others is protected. In recent years women have succeeded
 in achieving greater equality with men in terms of
 employment status and promotions. The Government pursues
 equal rights (including special considerations for women,
 for minority groups and for the economically
 disadvantaged) through legislation and effective
 government procedures to ensure compliance. Tens of
 thousands of people from former Dutch colonies and other
 former colonial areas have emigrated to the Netherlands,
 where many have acquired Dutch nationality and thereby
 have become permanent members of Dutch society. These
 ethnic minorities, along with emigrant workers from
 non-western European countries who have become temporary
 residents, face some discrimination in housing,
 employment, education, public accommodations, and social
 acceptance. These problems, which stem from individual
 attitudes and not from official government policy, appear
 to be on the increase. Discrimination because of race,
 color, or religion is prohibited by law. The Government
 is preparing a constitutional change reinforcing these
 prohibitions. In addition, there is currently before the
 Parliament a draft law which would impose specific
 penalties for various forms of discrimination because of
 sex, sexual inclination, or legal status in the fields of
 education, work, and legal treatment.
