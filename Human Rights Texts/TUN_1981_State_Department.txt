 TUNISIA
 Tunisia remains a relatively tolerant and open society with
 the institutions of parliamentary democracy, dominated by
 the personality of President-for-Life Habib Bourguiba.
 It is one of the most socially progressive countries in the
 Arab world, particularly regarding the status of women.
 Gradual political liberalization has taken place in the
 last year or so. Legislative elections, contested largely
 in the one-party framework, took place on November 1.
 President Bourguiba had announced that opposition groups
 would be allowed to participate in the elections and would
 be recognized as legal political parties if they obtained
 at least five percent of the vote. No opposition group
 received the necessary percentage. There were, however,
 some irregularities in the election procedures.
 The government had taken steps toward liberalization before
 the election. It removed a ban on the Communist Party
 imposed in 1963. It freed all of the central labor union
 (UGTT) leaders jailed after demonstrations in 1978. The
 union itself, a federation of over 400,000 workers, is
 again functioning as a free trade union after two years
 of governmental domination. The press remains subject to
 governmental censorship and several opposition publications
 are suspended, but other independent and opposition
 periodicals regularly criticize the government's internal
 policies.
 Last summer, leading Islamic fundamentalists were arrested
 on charges of unauthorized political activity. In the
 fall, 83 of them were sentenced to prison terms--two of
 them suspended--varying from six months to eleven years.
 During the trial, defense lawyers alleged that some of
 those arrested had been physically abused by police
 authorities. The Tunisian Human Rights League protested
 these alleged abuses, which would be violations of Tunisian
 law if proven.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture per se is not prohibited by Tunisian law, but
 article V of the constitution seeks to guarantee the
 "integrity of the person, freedom of conscience and religious
 belief, and equal rights under the law." Although torture
 is not a systematic practice, there are allegations that
 arrested Islamic activists charged with unauthorized political
 activity were physically abused by police authorities during
 their interrogation. Senior Tunisian officials have stated
 that such practices are not officially sanctioned, and have
 indicated that if they took place, they resulted from
 misconduct by individuals. According the Amnesty International,
 two Tunisian newspapers reported in January 1981 that a
 prisoner had died as a result of torture and poor prison
 conditions.

 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Tunisian law does not provide for physical punishment as a
 corrective measure. There were no allegations of such
 punishment in 1981. Summary executions have not occurred
 in Tunisia.
 Conditions in some Tunisian prisons are poor. The prison
 system continues to draw criticism from local legal and
 human rights bodies, and the government reportedly is
 seeking to make improvements.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no charges of abductions, secret arrests or
 clandestine detention by security forces or other elements
 answerable to the government.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Tunisian law provides that anyone suspected of a minor
 offense (punishable by imprisonment for less than one year)
 who has no previous criminal record may be held in pre-
 ventive detention for up to five days. Persons suspected
 of having committed a more serious offense can be detained
 without trial for an unlimited investigation period before
 being charged or released. There are no time limits within
 which an accused person must be brought to trial.
 Law and practice allow for arrest on suspicion alone, but
 formal warrants eventually must be issued if the suspect
 is detained. Despite such broad discretionary powers,. there
 is no pattern of systematic abuse. The whereabouts of a
 suspect must be made known to counsel and family, and in time
 access to prisoners is invariably granted. Many of the
 Islamic activists arrested in June were held for approximately
 one month without access to families or lawyers during their
 interrogation.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitution provides that "each person will be con-
 sidered.innocent until his guilt is proved in court where
 he is guaranteed the necessary conditions for self-defense."
 These prescriptions were generally respected in 1981,
 although in the case of the trial of 91 Islamic activists
 August 27 - September 4, public statements before the trial
 by government officials and a campaign in the official media
 tended to prejudice the outcome. The trial was public and
 held in a criminal court, rather than in a special security
 court. Although defense lawyers were given little time to
 prepare, they were allowed to argue that the charges were
 political in nature, and the proceedings were reported in the
 press.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Privacy of the home and correspondence is respected in Tunisia
 except as authorized by a formal warrant issued through the
 ministry of justice. No allegations of governmental viola-
 tion of these rights were made during 1981.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the constitution and
 
 
 1114
 reaffirmed by Tunisia's ratification of the Universal Declara-
 tion of Human Rights.
 According to the Tunisian press law, no publications can be
 printed or sold in Tunisia without appropriate authorization
 from the government. The same press code also forbids
 direct attacks against the president, senior members of the
 government or the structure of the Tunisian state.
 Opposition and independent newspapers are allowed to publish,
 although they are subject to governmental censorship and
 required to limit their criticism of governmental policies
 and to refrain from all criticism of President Bourguiba
 and senior government officials. Offending publications
 can be summarily suspended, and this was done several times
 during 1981.
 Major Arabic-language and Western periodicals are available
 in Tunisia, but from time to time an individual issue is
 withheld. Tunisian radio and TV are state-owned. There
 were no allegations of interference with academic inquiries
 in the natural or social sciences during 1981.
 The Tunisian trade union movement, which was repressed in
 1978 following violent clashes in the streets with security
 forces, has resumed normal functioning as a free trade
 union. All trade unionists who were removed from office
 and sentenced to prison terms after the January 26, 1978,
 general strike have been released. Habib Achour, the leader
 of the trade union during the strike, was recently released
 from house arrest and has resumed leadership of the union
 in the newly-created post of president.
 The constitution states that Islam is the state religion?
 but it also guarantees freedom of worship. This freedom is
 respected, and there are active Jewish and Christian
 communities in Tunisia. Non-Muslims are not subject to
 economic or employment disadvantages, except that employment
 opportunities with the government are almost entirely
 reserved for Muslims, who comprise over 99 percent of the
 population.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Tunisians are generally free to travel abroad and to return
 without restriction. By law, women are as free to travel
 outside the country as men, but mothers may have difficulty
 obtaining permission to travel abroad with their children
 if the Tunisian father objects. Domestic travel for Tunisian
 citizens is free and unrestricted. The government has
 instituted reforms which make passports easy and inexpensive
 to obtain, but the process sometimes still can be cumbersome.
 In general, it is easy to obtain a passport in Tunisia, but
 the government occasionally denies them to critics of the
 regime for political reasons.
 
 
 1115
 As of late 1981, there were about 60 documented foreign
 refugees living in Tunisia, most of whom were of advanced
 age and permanently settled. Foreigners are not encouraged
 to choose refuge in Tunisia, but the Tunisian government
 cooperates closely with the United Nations High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR), whd hasan office in Tunisia.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The constitution guarantees universal suffrage. Women are
 encouraged to vote, and many are active in political and
 government affairs. In addition to the governing Destourian
 Socialist Party (PSD), the Tunisian Communist Party has been
 legalized in the move toward political liberalization that
 gathered steam during most of 1981. Other opposition groups
 were permitted to carry on political activity in preparation
 for special legislative elections held in November, and
 President Bourguiba promised that any group which received
 five percent of the vote would be legalized. However, no
 opposition groups obtained the necessary five percent. The
 press reported electoral irregularities. The leaders
 of one opposition.group, the Islamic Tendency Movement,
 had been tried and sentenced to prison terms of up to
 eleven years on charges of unauthorized political activity
 before the election campaign officially began in October.
 High government office has generally been restricted to
 members of the ruling Destourian Socialist Party. Exceptions
 include a few provincial governors who are associated
 with the national labor union rather than the Party.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The government has not taken a public position concerning the
 activities of any international human rights organization
 with respect to Tunisia. In past years, Amnesty International
 has criticized Tunisia for the arrest, trial and imprisonment
 of prisoners of conscience irregularities in trial procedures,
 and the tortzre and ill-treatment of prisoners. However,
 Amnesty International in its 1981 report stated that all of
 its adopted prisoners of conscience in Tunisia had been
 released. Its representatives have visited the country
 to observe state security trials. The Tunisian Human Rights
 League has chapters in various Tunisian cities and acdest to
 senior government officials.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Tunisia is a middle income, developing country which has
 made impressive progress in raising real GNP, in distributing
 resulting gains, and in improving real income levels for
 the poorest segments of society. The percentage of the
 population living below the poverty line (as defined by the
 World Bank) decreased from 30 percent in 1970 to approximately
 15 percent in 1980. Real GNP grew by at least 6 percent in
 each of the last five years, with per capita GNP now estimated
 at almost $1,300. This figure masks significant income
 disparities between agricultural and non-agricultural occupa-
 tions and between urban and rural families.
 
 
 1116
 The government places a strong emphasis on social, educational"
 and health programs. This emphasis is apparent in key
 economic and social indicators: an infant mortality rate of
 90 per thousand births, an average life expectancy of 58.4
 years, and an adult literacy rate of 60 percent. Tunisia
 has an extremely active family-planning program and spends
 approximately one-third of its budget on education.
 In its efforts to improve living standards for the disad-
 vantaged sectors of the population, Tunisia nevertheless
 faces difficulties. The development of the agricultural
 sector has not kept pace with industrial development in
 recent years, and unemployment, officially measured at
 15 percent, is probably closer to 25 percent. The most
 recent development plan reflects awareness of the need to
 concentrate additional resources in these areas.
 During the past year the government endeavored to make
 agriculture a more attractive occupation and to slow rural-
 to-urban migration by sponsoring agricultural development
 projects and passing an investment law benefiting small
 farmers. It also moved to channel industrial development
 away from the coast toward the poorer interior of the country
 through investment incentives and job-training programs.
 Tunisian legislation provides for equality of men and
 women before the law. Divorce and child custody laws
 closely parallel those found in Western legal systems.
 Inheritance procedures, however, can be more restrictive,
 especially where non-Muslim women are concerned, and
 traditional practices may prevent women from fully exercising
 their legal rights.
