 PORTUGAL
 After a 48 year dictatorship, the revolution of
 April 26, 1974 in Portugal opened the way for dramatic
 improvements in human rights. Overnight, censorship
 was abolished, the secret police were dismantled, and
 free speech was exercised. Exiled opposition leaders
 returned, and political parties were formed. In the
 turbulent post-revolutionary period 1974-1975, there
 were isolated incidents of human rights violations by
 officials and agencies. Since a far-leftist coup
 attempt was overcome on November 25, 1975, however,
 respect for human rights has been one of the corner-
 stones of the new Portugal. The constitution promul-
 gated April 2, 1976, includes 25 articles spelling
 out "rights, freedoms and safeguards" guaranteed
 Portuguese citizens and residents. Portugal was
 elected in May 1978 to a term on the UN Human Rights
 Conmission ending in December, 1981.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Portugal has been free from torture since the dismant-
 ling of the secret police in 1974. Torture is forbidden
 under article 26 of the constitution and no evidence
 gained by such means may be used in criminal proceedings.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been no documented cases of cruel, inhuman
 or degrading treatment or punishment since November,
 1975. Such treatment or punishment is prohibited by
 the constitution. The death penalty was abolished over
 a century ago for civilian crimes and removed from the
 military penal code in 1977. Portugal's maximum penalty
 now is 28 years imprisonment.
 c.   Disappearances
 Persons are not abducted, secretly arrested or held in
 clandestine detention by police or security forces.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Since November 1975 there have been a few cases in which
 Portuguese citizens were held without specific charges
 longer than the 48-hour period allowed by the constitu-
 tion. In those cases, defense lawyers were able to
 obtain due process for their clients through legal
 efforts and publicity. The right to habeas corpus is
 guaranteed by the constitution.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Portugal allows no secret trials or condemnations, and
 the judicial system is fair. A large backlog of cases
 in the overburdened court system has, however, caused
 delays. Some individuals are held in prison for long
 periods before their cases come to trial. Bail is
 unusual for those accused of serious crimes. The
 government will soon introduce a revision of the penal
 (81)
 
 
 852
 code which is expected to modernize court procedures
 and to allow more efficient processing of cases.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 The inviolability of the home and the privacy of
 correspondence and other means of private communication
 are guaranteed. The constitution requires an "order
 of the competent judicial authority" for searches of
 and entries into homes and specifies that the consent
 of the occupants must be obtained to enter a home at
 night. The provisions are respected in practice, and
 any irregularities would be subject to immediate scru-
 tiny through the press and official institutions.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 These freedoms are guaranteed under the constitution
 and respected in practice, although two provisions
 of law limit the range of permissible political
 activity.
 The national assembly- passed the so-called "Anti-
 Fascist Law" in June 1978, prohibiting fascist organi-
 zations, discussions of corporatism and other activi-
 ties related to "fascism." The law provides penalties
 of from two to eight years imprisonment for violations.
 Because of its vagueness and applicability to only one
 side of the political spectrum, the law has been
 questioned by some Portuguese human rights advocates.
 There have been no prosecutions under the law.
 Portugal's penal code has a prqvision authorizing
 up to eight years imprisonment for those found guilty
 of "insulting" civil or military bodies, the president
 of the republic or members of the Revolutionary Council
 or the legislative assembly. A few journalists have
 been prosecuted under this statute; Manuel Murias,
 editor of the weekly "A Rua," was sentenced in February
 1980 to 14 months imprisonment for "insulting" President
 Eanes and the Revolutionary Council. Murias was released
 in September 1980 for good behavior. This constraint to
 the freedom of the press is not frequently enforced, has
 never resulted in the exaction of the full sentence and
 appears to be an aberration in an otherwise democratic
 system.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement, foreign travel and emigration are
 guaranteed by Article 44 of the constitution. Domes-
 tic travel is not circumscribed. However, currency
 exchange restrictions imposed because of balance of
 payments problems are a minor practical constraint on
 foreign travel by Portuguese citizens.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 The political system is a democratic multi-party
 system in which opposition parties operate freely
 
 
 853
 with access to the media. Only "fascist" organizations
 are outlawed. The government has respected the consti-
 tutional provision for universal, secret and equal
 suffrage for all citizens over 18 years of age.
 The April, 1978 revision of the civil code
 guarantees full legal equality for women in accord
 with the constitution. Portugal was one of the first
 signatories of the UN Convention On the Elimination
 of All Forms Of Discrimination Against Women. Maria
 de Lourdes Pintasilgo served as prime minister for
 five months in 1979, and the Eighth Constitutional
 Government has four women in positions just below the
 cabinet level. Women play an active role in the poli-
 tical parties, but still remain under-represented in
 party and government leadership positions. However,
 this situation has shown considerable improvement since
 the April 1974 revolution.
 Workers have the constitutional right to set up
 trade unions and trade union associations. A law
 prohibiting the establishment of more than one national
 labor confederation (which gave a monopoly to the
 communist-dominated General Confederation of Portuguese
 Workers-Inter-Sindical or CGTP-IN), was revoked in 1976,
 and a new democratic national trade confederation (UGT)
 has been established as an alternative to the CGTP-IN.
 The right to strike is protected by the constitution
 and observed in practice.
 Since early 1980 Portugal has experienced several
 attacks by a local extreme-left terrorist group against
 individuals and property. These attacks have been
 widely repudiated by the media and the political parties.
 The increase in terrorist activity has prompted the
 government to enact new legislation to deal with terror-
 ist offenses including a provision which permits, for
 the first time, reduced sentences for captured terrorists
 who assist law enforcement authorities in countering
 terrorist activity.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Portugal's government has cooperated with independent
 outside investigation of human rights conditions, and
 has brought the issue of the displaced persons of East
 Timor to the U.N.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 With GNP per capita of only $2180 (1979), Portugal is
 the poorest country in Western Europe. Economic condi-
 tions are especially difficult in rural areas of
 continental Portugal and the Azores and Madeira Islands.
 There is no discrimination shown in providing access to
 social or economic resources. Around 1975 the country
 was faced with an influx of more than one-half million
 refugees from its former colonies. The large majority
 of these refugees have been resettled in Portugal and
 integrated into society.

 In allocating public resources, the government of
 Portugal has promoted the construction of low income
 housing, increased pensions and the minimum wage to
 maintain their real value, and improved public access
 to medical care, water, sewage and sanitation facili-
 ties. Due to the severe drought conditions over the
 past year and an inadequate water supply system, there
 are acute water shortages in many parts of the country.
 Providing access to safe water will continue to be one
 of the government's major challenges in meeting the
 basic human needs of Portugal's population.
 Some 22.5 percent (1979) of the national adult population
 is illiterate. Government efforts to address this pro-
 blem have focused on a large school construction program
 with special emphasis on rural areas, and on the creation
 of adult education programs. Education is free through
 secondary school, and primary school education is now
 available in all areas of Portugal. For purposes of
 inter-country comparison, the adjusted primary school
 enrollment ratio (1978), as defined by the IBRD, is:
 Total 117; Male 119; and Female 115.
 Although women are guaranteed equal rights under
 the constitution, they suffer some disadvantages vis-a-
 vis men in seeking employment. One factor is the
 reluctance of some employers to hire women because of
 the cost of'generous mandatory maternity benefits.
 Reflecting the structural problems of the economy,
 unemployment and underemployment (approximately 11
 percent) are serious problems, especially for young
 people. Infant mortality, at 39 per 1000 live births,
 remains high by OECD standards. Life expectancy at
 birth (1979) is 71 years. Portugal's population grew
 from 9.01 million in 1970 to 9.86 million in 1979.
 Farm productivity is low. Portugal currently
 imports about one-half of its food requirements.
 The severe drought which hit Portugal in late 1980
 and early 1981 reduced 1981 crop production substan-
 tially and will further increase food imports.
 However, thanks to these imports and the government's
 policy'of subsidizing the consumer prices of basic
 foodstuffs, Portugal has been able to maintain an
 adequate nutritional standard for its population.
