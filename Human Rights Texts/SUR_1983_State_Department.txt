 SURINAME
 
 Suriname has been dominated by the military since 1980. A
 four-man National Policy Center, headed by the Commander of the
 National Armed Forces, Lieutenant Colonel Desire D. Bouterse, in
 effect rules the country. A Council of Ministers, headed by the
 Prime Minister, is assigned the task of implementing Policy
 Center decisions and running day-to-day government operations.
 The current Cabinet is a coalition of ministers from two former
 political parties, the Progressive Workers and Farmers Union
 (PALU) and the Revolutionary People's Party (RVP), plus four
 politically unaffiliated ministers.
 After Suriname became independent from the Netherlands in 1975,
 governments were elected until military rule began following the
 February 25, 1980, coup by a group of 16 noncommissioned
 officers. On August 13, 1980, the Parliament was dissolved and
 the Constitution was suspended. In December 8-9, 1982, 15
 opposition leaders (all but one were civilian) were killed while
 in government custody. The security forces, which have expanded
 since then, consist of the armed forces (including military
 police), the civil police, the people's militia, youth militia,
 and "anti-intervention committees." The "anti-intervention
 committees" were formed early in 1983 to organize the population
 against the "mercenary threat" which the regime believes is posed
 primarily by the Council for the Liberation of Suriname based in
 the Netherlands. Additionally, "revolutionary mass
 organizations" ("anti-intervention committees," youth militia,
 people's committees, youth organizations, and others) all have
 been assigned a role in mobilizing people to "defend the
 revolution" against its "imperialist and neo-colonialist" enemies
 and to induce citizens to support social and economic goals as
 defined by Bouterse.
 Suriname continues to have a predominantly free market economy,
 with state control or influence exerted principally through
 regulation. There has been a gradual increase in the number of
 industrial firms wholly or partly government controlled. There
 are few restrictions on individual, small-scale enterprises.
 Surinamers no longer have many of the human rights which they
 exercised before the imposition of military rule in 1980.
 Freedoms of speech and press are curtailed. There are no
 political mechanisms to allow all citizens a voice in how the
 Government is conducted or constituted. With no Parliament, laws
 are promulgated by decree. There is periodic invasion of the
 home. A midnight-to-four a.m. curfew is imposed from Monday
 through Friday. The Government has recently interfered in
 internal trade union matters. The expansion of the people's
 militia and "anti-intervention committees" has resulted in
 intimidation of many people.
 On the other hand, nonpolitical assembly and association are
 possible. Trade unions are able to carry out a number of trade
 union functions although they are clearly intimidated by the
 executions of December 1982. There is no attempt by the
 Government to restrict religious practices. Churches,
 synagogues, mosques, and Hindu temples are open and freely
 visited. The Bahai faith is freely practiced as well as African
 and Amerindian cults. Racial, sexist, or other forms of
 discrimination against individuals are not officially condoned by
 the Government.
 A special court, established to try former government officials
 accused of corruption, ended its work in June 1983'. The court
 
 (692)
 
 
 693
 was criticized by Amnesty International in its 1982 human rights
 report, which may have contributed to the Government's decision
 to disband it.
 Surinamers are free to travel within and outside the country.
 The Government has reluctantly allowed some international and
 non-governmental human rights organizations to investigate
 conditions in Suriname but has not allowed the dissemination of
 critical information in their reports within the country. The
 standard of living is comparatively high, despite current
 financial difficulties caused by the cutoff of aid from The
 Netherlands in December 1982.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1  Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom froms
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Surinamers continue to live under a five-day per week nighttime
 curfew from midnight to four a.m. imposed by the military in
 December 1982.  In February 1983, one person who allegedly
 violated the curfew was shot and killed by police. There were
 three reports of isolated curfew-related killings by security
 forces, but they have not been corroborated.
 On February 3, former Deputy Commander of the Army, Roy Horb,
 arrested the previous month with several of his bodyguards and
 two former ministers in connection with an alleged plot to
 assassinate Bouterse, was found dead in his cell.
 According to the official version of events, Horb was found
 hanging in his cell. The report released by the coroner, and
 investigation by police experts, agreed with the government's
 statement that there was no evidence of foul play, and that Horb
 had committed suicide. The government-controlled newspaper
 reported later that a medical laboratory in Holland found no
 evidence of drugs. However, other sources are skeptical and
 believe that the Government's account of Horb's death in his cell
 lacks credibility because it was allegedly done by using the
 waist-string from his gym shorts.
 b. Disappearance
 There were several unconfirmed reports that two of the bodyguards
 of the late Major Roy Horb who were arrested January 30th in
 connection with an alleged assasination plot were found dead in a
 river. The authorities have not publicly commented on those
 reports.
 As best as can be determined, the Government has not sponsored
 abductions or kidnappings by governmental or non-governmental
 forces. There are occasional unconfirmed reports of politically
 related disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 According to press reports, an investigator from the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) who visited
 Suriname in February said that prison conditions for political
 detainees in the alleged Horb conspiracy were poor.
 
 
 694
 Dutch nationals arrested and interrogated by military police
 received degrading treatment. On February 8, two Dutch sisters
 (one a Suriname resident) were arrested at the airport by
 military police and charged with sending seditious information
 (by telephone) out of the country. They were taken into custody
 for two days. They were subsequently obliged to appear on
 television where they were "interrogated" by an official of the
 government's national information service, and forced to confess
 their "crimes." One sister, who was expelled from the country,
 later reported that Bouterse told her that if she revealed
 anything of her treatment, her sister who remained in Suriname
 would be harmed. She also said she had been threatened and
 roughed up by military police officers. Suriname authorities
 maintained that the two sisters were assisting overseas enemies
 who wanted to "destabilize" the country's leadership. There was
 no official response to the allegations of mistreatment and
 threats.
 On August 23, a Dutch journalist and another Dutch citizen
 resident in French Guiana were arrested in Paramaribo for
 allegedly "photographing military objects." The journalist said
 after his expulsion from Suriname that he had been threatened
 with physical harm by the military police chief.
 Amnesty International in its 1983 report expressed concern about
 reported torture which had taken place in 1982.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There were approximately 13 reports of arbitrary arrest or
 detention since December 3, 1982, but they remain unconfirmed and
 the authorities have not admitted to such occurrences. According
 to the unconfirmed reports, those arrested were questioned for
 their alleged involvement in plots to invade Suriname by
 expatriate "mercenaries" of the Netherlands-based Council for the
 Liberation of Suriname. The detainees were reportedly released
 after one to three days of questioning without significant duress.
 On July 27, military police across Suriname deported 2,000 or
 more aliens, 80 percent of whom were illegal, undocumented
 workers from neighboring Guyana. Some of these were forced out
 of their beds without warning and put on buses for the border if
 they lacked proper documentation. The Guyanese ambassador in
 Paramaribo expressed the view that the Suriname Government was
 within its rights to deport these illegal immigrants.
 In the case of the late Major Horb and those implicated in his
 alleged assassination conspiracy, arrests were carried out by
 military police operating without court warrants.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The October 1983 report of the Inter-American Human Rights
 Commission on the human rights situation in Suriname, which
 focused primarily on events in the pre-1983 period, concluded
 that serious violations of important human rights have-occurred
 in Suriname.
 In the area of denial of fair-public trial, the Commission stated
 that independent judicial power in Suriname has been abridged
 since judges now serve at the pleasure of the Policy Center.
 Additionally, the report states "the climate of fear which
 pervades the legal profession," results in lawyers being
 
 
 695
 unwilling to defend people accused of political crimes. The
 report also stated that the judiciary cannot successfully assume
 jurisdiction over cases involving alleged threats to state
 security.
 Nevertheless, one minister accused of involvement in the alleged
 assassination conspiracy plot along with the late Major Horb was
 brought to trial in civil court where he was represented by legal
 counsel. Four of Horb's several bodyguards were court
 martialed. The bodyguards were acquitted for insufficient
 evidence. In both cases the civilian judge appeared to act
 independently, throwing out major charges against the accused,
 citing insufficient proof of guilt by the Government. The
 minister was found guilty of being in possession of a rifle and
 ammunition which he knew would be used in an assassination plot.
 The court recommended that eight months of his two year prison
 sentence be commuted due to time spent in pretrial detention.
 On November 29, the Government announced that it had arrested
 11 people in connection with arson and an alleged plot to
 destabilize the Government. The Government has stated that all
 would be turned over to civilian authorities for trial after the
 military police concluded their investigation.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There have been about 20 unconfirmed reports in 1983 that the
 Government engages in systematic telephonic surveillance to
 ferret out persons it perceives to be politically dangerous. The
 two Dutch sisters arrested for sedition may have been apprehended
 through information which the police gained via telephone taps.
 There are also 10-12 uncorroborated reports of mail openings by
 the post office. In addition, customs agents at the airport have
 on at least two occasions seized, opened, and read stamped mail
 which had been handed over by residents to travelers for posting
 outside Suriname. During maneuvers the army has also infringed
 on individual rights of privacy when vehicles were stopped and
 searched without advance warning, and homes in the maneuver areas
 were reportedly entered without notice or warrant. A
 m idnight-to-four a.m. curfew is imposed from Monday to Friday.
 The expansion of various "revolutionary mass organizations" which
 support the revolution has resulted in intimidation of many
 people. The people's militia and "anti-intervention committees"
 are urged by the Government to report any "suspicious" persons or
 actions by individuals in neighborhoods, and some units work
 closely with military police to "defend the revolution" against
 enemies.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Since December 8, 1982, Surinamers have become increasingly
 afraid to criticize their government. The establishment of
 "anti-intervention committees" within most public organizations
 and institutions has caused many citizens to fear that even one
 inadvertent critical comment about the country or its leaders may
 result in loss of jobs, or worse.
 Suriname has no independent press. In May 1983, the Government
 stated that when a committee now at work develops a code which
 journalists will have to adhere to, the private media which were
 closed or physically destroyed on December 8, 1982, will be
 permitted to reopen.
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 45
 
 
 696
 The only domestic news sources available to Surinamers are
 government-controlled facilities: one daily newspaper, one
 mimeographed news bulletin, one army newspaper, one political
 party newspaper, one television service, and one radio station
 with both AM and FM bands. In order to hear uncensored news
 about Suriname or the rest of the world, many Surinamers tune in
 to shortwave broadcasts of Radio Netherlands, the BBC, Voice of
 America, and Radio Guyana. The Government apparently attempted
 on one occasion to jam a broadcast by Radio Netherlands, which it
 accused of spreading antigovernment information disseminated by
 the Council for the Liberation of Suriname. The Government
 sporadically attempted to hinder newsstand distribution of
 international news magazines which it judges contain items
 detrimental to Suriname.
 The Inter-American Human Rights Commission report on Suriname
 also says that the people's right to free opinion has been
 jeopardized by a 1983 government decree which bans the
 possession, distribution, sale, and importation of any work that
 might be considered threatening to national security or public
 morals.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 In mid-1983 the Government withdrew the December 1982 decree
 which restricted public gatherings to no more than three
 persons.
 Labor organizations have resumed activities such as renegotiating
 wage agreements. There have been a few strikes. The Government
 has intervened in labor disputes to increase its influence in the
 labor movement. In one case, the Government imposed a referendum
 to resolve an internal union conflict at a lumber company. The
 moderate incumbent union board lost to a leadership slate backed
 by radical supporters of one government faction. The losing
 board has, however, initiated a law suit which, in part, alleges
 that the Government supervisors of the referendum allowed
 nonunion employees to vote. In another labor dispute, the
 National Policy Center appointed a military officer to
 investigate and report back to it on internal disagreements in a
 union at the Paramaribo docks. In a major strike at the end of
 1983 the Government chose to deal with the dispute through the
 trade union structure.
 The AFL-CIO issued a statement in October 1983 condemning
 Bouterse for his "continuing repression and abuse of trade union
 organizations" and in particular "Bouterse's wanton murder on
 December 8, 1982, of Cyrill Daal, Chairman of the Moederbond
 Labor Federation." The AFL-CIO pledged to work together with the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions to have trade
 union rights restored in Suriname.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no infringement on freedom of religion. Religious
 organizations have resumed normal activities following the
 December 1982 events. Articles and programs sponsored by
 churches and sects appear in the daily newspaper and on
 television and radio spots. In November 1983, two church
 organizations issued pamphlets criticizing Bouterse'e plan to
 create a new political structure in the country.
 
 
 697
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Surinamers are not restricted from traveling within the country,
 changing jobs, or moving residences. Many continue to emigrate
 abroad without interference from the Government. The Government
 does not prevent persons from returning to Suriname after long
 residence abroad. However, those Surinamers overseas whom the
 Government has characterized as "mercenaries," "traitors," and
 "threats to national security" (these include former President
 Chin a Sen and others supporting opposition leaders who were
 executed in December 1982) fear for their safety if they were to
 return to Suriname.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Surinamers do not have the right to change their government.
 There have been no elections in the country since the military
 coup of February 25, 1980, and none are scheduled. Political
 parties remain banned. Political organization is limited to
 supporters of the revolution through officially sanctioned
 organizations, such as "anti-intervention committees." Bouterse
 has said several times since 1982 that parliamentary democracy is
 dead in Suriname.
 On May 1, 1983, the Government said that it plans to establish
 procedures and structures which will lead to selection by the
 people of a representative commission to draft a constitution.
 This pledge was renewed in a draft political document circulated
 by the Government which could lead to creation of a one party
 system and a "statute of basic rights and duties" but no date for
 the constitution or for application of the statute has been
 announced.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no independent domestic organizations concerned with
 human rights. Local organizations which address individual
 issues, such as women's rights and the press, are officially
 sanctioned in order to further the Government's political
 objectives.
 The Government reluctantly has allowed international and
 non-governmental investigations of human rights in Suriname. The
 Government attempts to control the activities of visiting
 investigative teams, to limit public knowledge of critical
 reports and exaggerates any investigation or report which
 contains positive comments.
 In February 1983, following a visit by the representative of the
 .ICRC to investigate prison conditions, the Government issued a
 statement intended to show itself as sensitive to human rights
 issues. In a report about the ICRC team visiting Suriname in
 October 1983, the Government-controlled newspaper made the
 charges that  "destabilizing" elements overseas attempted to use
 ICRC findings against Suriname. In March 1983, the International
 Commission of Jurists sent a mission to Suriname to investigate
 the December 8-9, 1982, killings. The Government publicly
 interpreted the visit as supportive of its human rights policies
 and did not publish any of the Commission's critical findings.
 
 
 698
 The April 1983 visit by the Inter-American Human Rights
 Commission received sparse press coverage. Commission officials
 were shown in the press and on television meeting with government
 officials, but no government statement regarding the visit was
 issued. A July 1983 visit by a Caribbean Congress of Labor team
 investigating the status of trade unions received local media
 coverage highlighting the Government's labor policies. A visit
 by the Special Rapporteur of the U.N. Human Rights Commission has
 been indefinitely postponed.
 The Surinamese Government is not itself actively involved in
 international or regional human rights bodies dealing with
 violations in other countries. It is passive except when the
 Government itself stands accused, as before the U.N. Human Rights
 Commission in Geneva in February 1983. At that time, in protest
 against Dutch Government criticism of Suriname before the
 U.N.H.R.C., the Suriname Government publicly'attacked the
 Netherlands and accused it of political motives.
 In 1983, Amnesty International's main concern in Suriname was the
 summary or extrajudicial executions of alleged opponents of the
 Government by the armed forces in 1982. Freedom House rated
 Suriname "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Despite the Government's tendency steadily to increase state
 control of the economy, no nationalizations of firms or
 industries have taken place this year. Instead, the Government
 tightened regulatory control over the country's still vigorous
 private sector.
 Suriname has an estimated population of 363,000 and its
 population growth rate is 1.80 percent. Per capita Gross
 National Product (GNP), according to World Bank data, was
 $3,032.40 in 1981, but the most recent Government of Suriname GNP
 figure was $2,860 in 1982. Life expectancy at birth is 68.28
 years. the infant mortality rate is 23.70 per 1,000 live births,
 and adult literacy is 65 percent. The adjusted primary school
 enrollment ratio in 1978 was 103. In 1977 the caloric supply as
 a percentage of requirements was 123.35.
 Economic stagnation continues due to a combination of political
 and economic factors. The Government has not succeeded in
 convincing local and foreign investors that the climate for
 economic activity has improved. The economy remains highly
 dependent on exports of bauxite and aluminum from the two
 bauxite-producing companies. The bauxite levy has provided a
 significant percentage of Suriname's budget revenues. Overall
 unemployment is estimated at about 20 percent, and unemployment
 of the young is much higher.
 Despite this decline in economic activity, the Government has
 declared its commitment to bring free schooling to more children,
 including those in remote areas, and to free medical care and
 increased retirement benefits. However, given the lack of
 success to date in the search for financial aid to replace the
 former Dutch development funds, the Government has begun
 emphasizing construction of a self-sustaining economy and has
 said that citizens can expect taxes to be raised in the near
 future.
 Several women's organizations in Suriname are sponsored by the
 Ministry of People's Mobilization and Culture. Their main goals
 are to mobilize women to support the revolution, but they also
 help bring women into the labor force, try to insure equal
 treatment in employment and sponsor the establishment of day care
 centers. Women have traditionally been active politically
 through various civic organizations. Women do hold positions in
 various government ministries, although none is currently serving
 in the Cabinet.
