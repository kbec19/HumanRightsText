 PALAU
 Formerly a United Nations trusteeship administered by the United States, Palau
 became an independent nation in free association with the United States on October
 1, 1994. Under the Compact of Free Association, the United States is responsible
 for the Republic of Palau's defense. An archipelago of more than 300 islands in the
 Western Pacific, Palau has a total land area of 188 square miles and is organized
 politically into 16 states. More than two-thirds of its approximately 18,000 popu-
 ation resides in or near the temporary capital, Koror.
 The democratically elected Government is modeled after that of the United States.
 The Constitution, which took effect in 1981, provides for free and fair elections, ex-
 ecutive and legislative branches, and an independent judiciary. The legislature, the
 Olbil Era Kelulau, is composed of two equal houses, the 14-member Senate and the
 16-member House of Delegates. The judiciary is independent.
 Palau has no security forces, other than local police and civilian law enforcement
 personnel, all of whom are under the firm control of civil authorities. Palau also has
 a Marine Law Enforcement Division that patrols its borders with assistance from
 the Australian Government.
 With a household median income of over $12,000, Palau is a medium income
 country with a small, market-based economy largely sustained by transfer payments
 from the United States. The Government employs nearly half of the work force.
 Tourism and other service sectors account for most other paid employment. Tuna,
 harvested by foreign operated fleets, is the dominant export. Several small-scale op-
 erations, employing foreign workers, assemble clothing from imported materials for
 export. Traditional subsistence agriculture and fishing is diminishing as people
 move to the city in search of employment. There is also an increasing number of
 Chinese farmers who operate vegetable farms that compete with indigenous farm-
 ers; most of the indigenous farmers are individual growers who work and sell what
 they produce from their own land.
 Traditional customs sustain a value system that distinguishes between people on
 the basis of social status and sex. The loosening ties of the extended family and the
 increasing abuse of alcohol and other drugs are major contributing factors that lead
 to instances of domestic violence and child neglect. Societal discrimination against
 certain foreign workers, who account for nearly 30 percent of the population and 46
 percent of the paid work force, is also a serious problem.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.

 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution, prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials

 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention,' or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 �e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government xespects this provision in practice. The judiciary com-
 rises the Sulreme Court, the National Court, and the Court of Common Pleas. The
 President a ppoints judges .to the Supreme Court and National Court from a list rec-
 ommended-by the Judicial Nominating Commission. Appointments are for life.
 The Government includes an-independent special prosecutor and an independent
 public defender system. The Constitution provides for the right to a fair trial, and
 an independent judiciary vigorously enforces this right.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.                           ,�
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, flame, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An inde-
 pendent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system
 combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.

 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re -
 spects them -in practice.
 The Government has not formulated a policy regarding refugees, asylees, or first
 asylum and government practice remains undefined. However, there were no reports
 of forced expulsion of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 There are no legal impediments to women participating in government and poli-
 tics. As a result of the 1996 general elections, a woman gained a Senate seat for
 the first time. Women hold office in 10 of the 16 state legislatures where they con-
 stitute 7 percent of the membership.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Palau has a history of openness to a variety of human rights groups without gov-
 ernment restriction. Government officials have met with representatives of these
 groups and foreign officials regarding the civil rights of foreign minority workers.
 Government officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views. The
 Palau Red Cross Society opened its office in 1996; having satisfied all requirements,
 the Society has applications pending for full membership in the International Fed-
 eration of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, race, place of origin,
 language, religion or belief, social status or clan affiliation, and the Government
 generally respects these provisions.
 Women.-There are occasional allegations of violence against women, mainly re-
 lated to domestic abuse. Alcohol and other drug abuse increasingly contribute to this
 
 
 1025
 problem. According to the Attorney General's office, the Government's Public Health
 Office, and women's groups, only a few such cases are reported to the authorities
 every year, but many more are believed to go unreported. Although assault is a
 criminal offense, women are reluctant to prosecute their spouses.
 Inheritance of property and of traditional rank is matrilineal, with women occupy-
 ing positions of importance within the traditional system. Women serve by presi-
 dential appointment as bureau directors for women's interests, human resources,
 and clinical services. No instances of unequal pay for equal work or sex-related job
 discrimination were reported to the office of the Attorney General.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care. There is no societal pattern of abuse directed against children. Child prostitu-
 tion is neither accepted within the culture nor practiced. There is no difference in
 the treatment of girls and boys in educational opportunities offered in Palau, or in
 availability of scholarships to attend postsecondary education abroad. Girls and boys
 receive equal treatment in health-care services.
 Child abuse is thought to be uncommon, and there have been few child abuse
 prosecutions. While children's rights are generally respected, there were reports of
 several instances of child neglect, a byproduct of the breakdown of the extended
 family.
 People With Disabilities.-The National Code includes a Disabled Persons Anti-
 discrimination Act and a Handicapped Children Act. There were no reported in-
 stances of discrimination against the disabled. There are no building codes or legis-
 lation requiring access for the disabled. The public schools have established special
 education programs to address problems encountered by those with disabilities.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Non-Palauans are prohibited from purchas-
 ing land or obtaining citizenship. The rapid increase in the number of foreign work-
 ers, who now constitute nearly 30 percent of the population and 46 percent of the
 work force, is viewed negatively by a majority of citizens. Foreign residents can be
 subject to some forms of discrimination and are targets of petty, and sometimes vio-
 lent, crimes, as well as other random acts against person and property. There have
 been credible complaints by foreign residents that crimes against non-Palauans are
 not pursued or persecuted by authorities with the same vigor as crimes against
 Palauan nationals. Certain nationalities experience generalized discrimination in
 employment, pay, housing, education, and access to social services, although such
 discrimination is prohibited by law. While precise data are lacking, there continue
 to be anecdotal reports about instances of abuse of workers' civil rights perpetrated
 against domestic helpers, bar girls, construction laborers, and other semiskilled
 workers, the majority of whom are from the Philippines, China, and Bangladesh.
 The most common abuses identified are misrepresentation of contract terms and
 conditions of employment, withholding of pay or benefits, and, sometimes, physical
 abuse. In a number of instances, local authorities have taken corrective action when
 alerted by social service and religious organizations to whom foreign workers have
 turned for assistance. Nonetheless, foreign workers often are reluctant to seek legal
 redress for fear of losing their employment and, thus, permission to remain in the
 country.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of all persons
 to assemble peacefully or to associate with others for any lawful purpose, including
 the right to organize and to bargain collectively. There are no active employee orga-
 nizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution does not
 provide for the right to strike, and the Government has not addressed this issue.
 There is no legislation concerning collective bargaining or trade union organizations,
 although there are no legal impediments to either. Wages in the cash economy are
 determined by market factors.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits slavery
 or involuntary servitude except to punish crime. The law does not specifically pro-
 hibit forced and bonded labor by children, but such practices are not known to occur.
 There were reported instances of foreign workers, especially domestic helpers and
 unskilled laborers, being forced to do jobs different from those for which they were
 recruited. Freedom of foreign workers to leave employment situations not to their
 liking may be hindered by physical barriers or the withholding of passports and re-
 turn tickets to their country of recruitment.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Con-
 stitution states that the Government shall protect children from exploitation, and
 
 
 10M6
 children are protected by the general constitutional prohibition against forced and
 bonded labor (see Section 6.c.). There is no minimum age for employment. Children
 tyically are not employed in the wage economy, but some assist their families with
 fishg, agriculture, and other small-scale family enterprises. The law-requires com-
 pulsory education for children between 6 to 14 years of age, and the Government
 generally enforces this law. By regulation no foreigner under the age of 21 may be
 admitted int Palau for employment purposes.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In July Palau passed its first minimum wage
 law. The law sets the minimum wage at $2.50 per hour, effective January 1, 1999;
 foreign workers are exempt from the minimum wage law. This amount appears to
 be sufficient, given the level of economic development, to provide a worker and his
 family with a decent standard of living. Anecdotal evidence indicates that unskilled
 workers for commercial firms are paid only $1.50 to $2.00 per hour.-However, for-
 eign workers are usually provide , in addition to their wages, with basic accom-
 modations and food at no or nominal cost. Although these wages are low, Palau con-
 tinues to attract large numbers of foreign workers from the Philippines, China, and
 Bangladesh. There are more than 5,000 foreign nationals with work permits. How-
 ever, as the number of foreign workers increases, there continue to be increasing
 numbers of reports of mistreatment of such workers by their employers. These inci-
 dents of alleged mistreatment are common knowledge among the general public but
 rarely are reported to law enforcement authorities by the foreign workers them-
 selves due to fear of their employers. Some types of mistreatment that foreign work-
 ers consistently complain about are: physical and verbal abuse; working overtime
 'and on days off without pay, withholding monthly salary; deductions from salary for
 the amount of, airfare; and substandard housing. Some workers also have com-
 plained that they are not given enough food. The foreign workers most likely to be
 abused are those whor work under contracts and earn between $100 and $300 a
 month as domestic helpers, construction workers, farmers, waitresses, beauticians,
 and hostesses in karaoke bars and massage parlors. Under the terms of their con-
 tracts, -they are also supposed to be provided'room and board and air travel from
 their home country to Palau and back after the termination of their contracts. It
 generally is assumed that legislators specifically exempted contract workers in the
 July minimum wage bill to ensure a continued supply of low cost labor in industries
 that the legislators often control.
 There is no legislation concerning maximum hours of work, although most busi-
 nesses are closed on either Saturday or Sunday. The Division of Labor has prepared
 some regulations regarding conditions of employment for nonresident workers. The
 Division may inspect the conditions of the workplace and employer-provided housing
 on specific complaint of the employees, but actual enforcement is sporadic; working
 conditions vary in practice. There is no legislation specifically giving workers the
 right to remove themselves from situations that endanger their health or safety
 without jeopardy to their continued employment, and there is no legislation protect-
 ing workers who fie complaints about such conditions.
