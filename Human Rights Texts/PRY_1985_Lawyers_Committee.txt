PARAGUAY
The Reagan Administration has played an exemplary role in attempting to promote human rights in Paraguay and this is an exemplary Report. It is accurate, balanced, clear and reflects a thorough familiarity with the human rights situation. Particular cases of abuses — such as cases of torture; the nine month detention without trial of human rights lawyer Heriberto Alegre; the harassment of the leaders of the MOPOCO political faction; the continuing exile of political leaders Domingo Laino, Luis Resck and of Novelist Agosto Roa Bastos; the continuing shut-down of the country's leading newspaper, ABC Color; the harassment of Radio Nanduti; etc. — are discussed knowledgeably and forthrightly.
According to the Report, "There continue to be violations of civil and political liberties, though the number of serious incidents has declined significantly since the mid-1970's." In the case of Paraguay, the State Department would have been entitled to add that its efforts since the mid-1970*s are probably responsible for that decline. A fine Report such as this one is just the sort of effort that makes a difference.
