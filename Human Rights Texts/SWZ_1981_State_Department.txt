 SWAZILAND
 The Kingdom of Swaziland, a former British High Commis-
 sion territory, acceded to independence in 1968 with a
 constitution that provided for a popularly elected
 parliament and for the protection of fundamental rights
 and freedoms of the individual. On the grounds that the
 constitution had permitted the introduction of political
 practices incompatible with the traditional Swazi way
 of reaching decisions, King Sobhuza II decreed its
 repeal in 1973. He assumed supreme power, governmental
 decisions thereafter being made by king-in-council; the
 council comprised cabinet members appointed by him.
 A royal commission was appointed in 1973 to inquire into
 the fundamental principles upon which to base a new
 constitution that would harmonize the customary Swazi
 way of life with modern principles of constitutional
 and international law. There has been no public
 report on the commission's progress.
 Parliament was reopened in January 1979 with some
 members chosen through indirect election and others
 nominated by the king.
 King Sobhuza continues to be vested with the country's
 executive authority. He rules through a cabinet
 appointed by him, and he retains the right to withhold
 assent to bills passed by the parliament. The king's
 authority is limited in practice by a complex system of
 traditional rights and responsibilities.which requires
 that it be exercised in accordance with Swazi custom.
 The judiciary is independent. Despite the absence of
 a constitution or other written legal safeguards, there
 has been no systematic disregard by the government for
 the rights of the person.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There is no law which prohibits torture but there have
 been no allegations that torture is countenanced or
 practiced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There is no evidence that persons in Swaziland have been
 subjected to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment. Capital punishment is legal in Swaziland.
 In 1981 eight persons were executed; all had been convic-
 ted through due process of committing ritual murders. The
 country's main prison includes facilitiqs for teaching
 manual trades. The health care and diet in the prisons
 are approximately the same as those available to the
 general population. Prisoners are allowed visits from
 family members and from attorneys of their choice.
 c. Disappearances
 A 1978 law authorizing detention provides that it shall
 be made public. Generally speaking, persons are not
 abducted or secretly arrested and are held clandestinely
 only in rare instances in which they are believed to be
 
 (272)
 
 
 273
 material witnesses in cases under police investigation.
 Persons do not "disappear" in Swaziland for protracted
 periods.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Under a 1938 law, persons can be arrested and held with-
 out charge for a *reasonable" period, the 1978 law
 permits the government to detain any individual for
 renewable periods of sixty days without being charged.
 Although the law provides that the fact of such deten-
 tion shall be made public, no instance of detention
 under that law has been officially acknowledged until
 after the detained individuals have been released.
 Detention is not subject to appeal to the courts,
 although it may be appealed directly to the king.
 The right to habeas corpus is provided in Swazi courts
 for all other prisoners. Swaziland has no known pol-
 itical prisoners.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is provided for by law
 and is honored in practice. In "national" (traditional)
 courts, legal counsel is not allowed, but defendants can
 adequately represent themselves.   However, in magis-
 trates' courts, which operate under Roman-Dutch law,
 a defendant is entitled to counsel at his own expense;
 the crown will provide a pro deo defense in capital
 cases. Counsel has free access to defendants within the
 limits of prison regulations. Harassment of defense
 counsel by the government does not occur. Except for
 detainees under the 1978 law, defendants are made fully
 aware of the charges against them. They and their lawyers
 are generally able to inform themselves of the evidence
 on which the charges are based. The courts are independ-
 ent of executive or military control. There are no
 special courts to deal with security or political
 offenses. Civilians are not tried by military courts.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home is safeguarded by custom and
 is honored in practice. Swaziland law requires a warrant
 for the search of a home, or other premises, except when
 the purpose of the search would be defeated by delay in
 obtaining the warrant. Allegations that government
 officers have illegally entered homes are very infrequent;
 none came to public attention in 1981. There have been
 no allegations that the government practices *bugging",
 demolition, or the sealing of doors and windows of homes.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion, and Assembly
 Freedom of speech is not guaranteed by law. Comment
 critical of the government is permitted in parliament,
 in traditional Swazi councils and to some degree in the
 media, which practices self-censorship. During the
 last year, parliament has been increasingly willing to
 serve as a forum for examination and criticism of govern-
 ment policies. The government proscribes publications
 it deems to be prejudicial to the interests of defense,
 public safety and order, public morality, and public
 health. In practice, except for material that is obscene
 or communist oriented, the local and international press
 circulate freely in Swaziland.
 
 
 274
 The king's proclamation of April 12, 1973, provides that
 no meetings of a political nature and no processions or
 demonstrations shall be held in any public place except
 with the written consent, not always granted, of the
 commissioner of police. Except for the prohibition on
 political activity, there are no impediments to the
 freedom of association. There are seven registered trade
 unions in Swaziland; however, only one is active.
 The Swaziland National Association of Teachers remains
 dissolved following a government determination in 1977
 that it was engaging in political activity. Writers and
 journalists who were denied permission in late 1979 to
 meet and discuss the formation of a social association
 have made no further attempt to form an association.
 The Industrial Relations Act of 1980, a modern and
 detailed piece of legislation, guarantees the right to
 organize to employees and employers. It also establishes
 negotiating machinery and a disputes procedure. Employers
 may not discriminate against union members. Employees may
 strike and picket. Although yet to be implemented the
 Industrial Relations Act will provide a framework for
 labor unions to become more active.
 Although there is no law on the subject, Swaziland is
 traditionally hospitable to all religious beliefs. There
 is no state religion and religious groups are not persecuted
 or harassed.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Internal travel is guaranteed by custom and is respected
 in practice. External travel outside of southern Africa
 requires a passport which the government denies if it
 deems the applicant's proposed travel to be prejudicial
 to its interests or if the applicant has no apparent
 means of support for the proposed period of absence
 from Swaziland. Passport fees are not excessive.
 The right of return is granted to all Swazi passport
 holders but is almost universally-denied to refugees who
 leave Swaziland on United Nations travel documents.
 A new immigration bill which consolidates and revises
 existing legislation was published in late 1981. When
 enacted, this legislation will provide a modern framework
 for dealing with immigration matters. The section on
 prohibited immigrants will improve the procedures for
 refugee status.
 Refugee and asylum policy is governed by the Refugee
 Control Order of 1978. Sections of this order conflict
 with the UN Refugee Convention and Protocol, of which
 Swaziland is a signator. There are about 5,500 refugees
 from the Republic of South Africa in Swaziland and less
 than fifty from Mozambique. The majority of these have
 been resettled in rural areas, but a small percentage are
 living in the country's two urban areas. Small numbers
 of South African refugees transit Swaziland on their way
 to third countries. Few Swazis flee their own country.
 In general, refugees are adequately treated by local
 standards.
 In 1980,Swaziland signed an agreement with Mozambique
 on the repatriation of refugees which is not in accord
 
 
 275
 with the UN Refugee Convention because it provides for
 forcible repatriation. Shortly after the agreement
 was signed, 68 Mozambican refugees were repatriated and
 three refugees were sent back to Swaziland. The latter
 three were convicted of contravening the Immigration Act
 and given light sentences. No repatriations are known
 to have taken place in 1981. A South African refugee
 employed as a teacher and reportedly associated with a
 national liberation movement was kidnap?ed in February.
 He was returned to Swaziland by South African authorities
 approximately three weeks later after considerable
 representation was made by Swaziland authorities. Four
 persons were indicted for the kidnapping and subsequently
 granted bail. They have not yet been brought to trial.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Swaziland is a traditional monarchy. Political parties
 are outlawed. There is no organized opposition to the
 government. All citizens may vote in indirect contested
 elections for members of parliament and may participate
 in meetings of their respective Itinkhundla" (geograph-
 ically-based councils). During 1981 the first elections
 under this system were held to fill two vacant seats in
 the House of Assembly. Serious problems of nationality,
 citizenship, and statelessness do not exist; however,
 there are reports that some persons, especially of mized
 ethnic background, have encountered difficulties in proving
 citizenship and thus obtaining passports.
 The ability of Swazi women to deal with the problems
 of a developing society is hampered by both legal and
 cultural constraints. Traditional values are a major
 influence on the role of women in Swazi society. Women
 are not legally equal to men and a married woman is
 virtually a legal minor. She is not responsible for
 contracts she signs, she cannot own real property or
 inherit property under normal circumstances. She must
 obtain her husband's permission to borrow money, to leave
 the country and often to take a job. In situations of
 divorce, a woman has no right to the custody of her
 children, although she may have to care for them with
 no support from their father. A small and slowly growing
 number of women are participating in social, economic, and
 political life outside their traditional fields of
 teaching, nursing and clerical work.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government of Swaziland does not normally respond
 substantively to inquiries of representatives of
 amnesty groups concerning the welfare and whereabouts
 of individual political detainees. There are no organi-
 zations based within the country that observe, report or
 contest human rights violations. In 1981 no outside
 person or team is known to have sought the government's
 permission to undertake an investigation of alleged vio-
 lations of human rights.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Swaziland has a free-enterprise economy characterized
 by a division between the modern sector, dominated by non-
 Swazis, which produces most of the country's wealth, and
 the traditional sector, which comprises over 80 percent
 
 
 276
 of the population. Gross national product per capita in
 1979 was estimated to be $650. Nearly 85 percent of the
 population lives in the rural areas and practices sub-
 sistence agriculture. Two recent studies have estimated
 that the total value of on-farm production was under
 $60 per capita in 1978. For approximately 80 percent of
 homesteads, this was supplemented by modern sector work
 remittances which raised the per capita income for these
 homesteads to $210 per year. According to World Bank
 figures, approximately 50 percent of the population is
 below the absolute poverty level. Agriculture employs
 about seventy-five percent of the resident labor force.
 Visible unemployment is estimated at 5-10 percent of the
 labor force and is rising. The inflation rate is esti-
 mated to be 15-17 percent annually. Swaziland's popula-
 tion growth rate of approximately 2.8 percent per year is
 placing strains on limited land resources and is contrib-
 uting to the rising unemployment rate.
 About 60 percent of the land is held in trust by the
 King for the Swazi nation; this land is occupied largely
 by traditional farmers. The other 40 percent is privately
 owned. The right to own property is guaranteed by law.
 The tax system is progressive, with the burden falling
 primarily on the small, modern sector; there is no sales
 tax, and the traditional subsistence sector is largely
 untaxed.
 The Employment Act of 1980 forbids employers from dis-
 criminating between employees based on race, religion,
 sex, marital status, or political affiliation. It re-
 quires equal pay for equal work. There are provisions
 covering the employment of children, providing maternity
 leave for women employees and special provisions for
 domestic employees. Minimum wage legislation does not
 discriminate between men and women. Legally, women are
 not discriminated against in the job market, but in
 practice discrimination does take place.
 Swaziland's development strategy has, until recently,
 emphasized industrialization and has thus contributed to
 the dichotomous nature of the economy; however, attention
 is increasingly being paid to equity. The third national
 development plan (1978/79 - 1982/83) assigns high prior-
 ity to the following: increasing agricultural production
 by 6 percent annually and extension of the rural develop-
 ment areas program to cover 60 percent of Swazi nation
 farmers; expanding education and training programs to meet
 the country's manpower and employment needs; increasing
 the quality, quantity and distribution of preventive
 health services; and expanding coverage of family planning
 services to reduce the population growth rate. The
 1981/82 budget devotes approximately the same percentage
 of total resources to ministries concerned with basic
 human needs as the previous year's budget. Housing
 policies have tended to stress quality over quantity,
 leaving large unmet shelter needs in both rural and urban
 areas.
 Swaziland's adult literacy rate is 65 percent and its
 primary school enrollment ratio of 75 percent compares
 very favorably with other developing countries with
 similar income levels. Standards are low and are declin-
 
 
 277
 irg because emphasis is on quantity at the expense of
 quality. The education system does not discriminate
 against women, and men and women have roughly the same
 educational levels, except in the higher age/education
 brackets. This is because women have only recently
 (in the last ten years) been afforded equal access at
 primary and secondary levels. Today, women students out-
 number men at the university. The government's goal
 of universal primary education by 1985 will probably not
 be met until later in the decade.
 Indicators of the health status of the population are
 below average for countries of similar income levels.
 Life expectancy is only 47 years and infant mortality
 is 156 per 1,000. Swaziland has 58 doctors and 467
 registered nurses or one doctor per 9,500 people and one
 nurse per 1,200 persons. Health care is provided through
 a system of government hospitals and clinics and by med-
 ical installations operated by private companies and
 religious missions. The government is striving toward a
 goal of adequate medical care for at least 75 percent of
 the population. Only 25 percent of the rural population
 has access to safe water, while 99 percent of the urban
 population has potable water. About 37 percent of the
 total population has access to some type of toilet
 facility.
