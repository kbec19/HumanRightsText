 NEPAL
 During 1979, a combination of social forces, political
 agitation and initiative by the King resulted in departure
 by Nepal from its traditionally authoritarian form of
 government, and embarkation upon a new process of political
 evolution. On May 24 King Birendra called for a national
 referendum (the first national vote since 1959; the second
 in the nation's history) on whether to continue Nepal's
 present form of government, which bans political parties,
 or to opt for an alternative (as yet incompletely defined)
 based on political parties. In preparation for this refer-
 endum, which is expected to be held in May or June 1980,
 the King has adopted a neutral political stance and the
 government has suspended the administration of many laws
 and constitutional provisions which, in the past, restric-
 ted political activity and freedom of expression. The
 outcome of the referendum process is still unclear, but for
 the present. the people of Nepal are playing a significantly
 greater role in freely determining their political future.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law in Nepal. There have been
 occasional allegations of abuses in Nepalese police stations
 and prisons. To the extent that abuses do occur, the
 Department of State does not believe them to be widespread
 or a matter of routine. While the authorities do not con-
 done torture, they do not closely supervise police and
 prison activities, nor are they known to have punished any
 officials for alleged acts of brutality toward prisoners.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Capital punishment is seldom imposed in Nepal and only in
 cases involying treason and crimes against the Monarchy. There
 were two executions in 1979, the first in well over a decade.
 Cruel or inhuman treatment of those arrested is not general
 practice. The infrequent abuses happen at the time of arrest
 or during the first day or two of detention. There are
 occasional rumors of alleged disappearances of those in
 custody, but no confirmed cases of summary execution. Though
 Nepalese prison conditions reflect the standard of livinq in one
 of the world's poorer countries, prisoners receive traditional
 Nepalese food (or an allowance to purchase their own food),
 have access to a hospital, doctor, and medicine, and may have
 regular visitors as well as an attorney. Political prisoners
 have generally received better-treatment--in terms of visitors,
 reading and writing material, and luxuries from the outside--
 than those convicted of criminal acts.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Public Security Act of 1971 provides for preventive
 detention and "other measures" as may be required to
 .maintain peace and security." Opponents of the monarchy
 
 (801)
 
 
 802
 have in the past been jailed for long periods of time with-
 out charge or access to the courts; at present there are
 probably fewer than 20 people held under the Security Act.
 Nepalese opposition figures estimate that 75 to 150
 prisoners currently held under criminal statutes may have
 been arrested for political reasons. In any case, the
 number has fluctuated considerably in 1979, because of
 the practice of detaining briefly (for a few days) some
 participants in demonstrations. The legal remedy of
 habeas corpus is provided for by law, but in practice its
 application is infrequent.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Nepal has a well-organized system of courts (including
 special courts which are convened occasionally to handle
 specific cases). Judges are appointed by the government,
 and it is not unusual in practice for them to seek at least
 tacit government approval of their rulings in cases involving
 political considerations, or appeals for the release of
 prisoners detained without specific charges. The law provides
 the right to a fair public trial in most cases (some security
 and customs cases excepted), and this right is generally
 honored in practice. Defendants are entitled to counsel
 (though not always their first choice) and can talk in
 reasonably private circumstances. Charges are expl ined
 to defendants, and the general (though not always the
 detailed) evidence on which the charges are based is presented
 in court. Military courts do not try civilians. In early
 1979 the government, acting in accordance with court sentences
 imposed under the Treason Act for "raising arms against the
 State", suddenly executed two men who had been sentenced to
 death three and four years earlier respectively.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home is safeguarded by law and custom.
 Arrest and search warrants are generally required prior
 to search and seizure, except in a few situations prescribed
 by law, such as narcotics control. There have been a few
 confirmed accounts of illegal entry.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Two-thirds of Nepal's land is mountainous, the remainder
 a drought-prone but relatively fertile plain. Aside from
 hydroelectric potential, other natural resources are limited.
 Nepal has the world's lowest per capita energy consumption
 and one of the highest proportions of labor force in
 agriculture (91 perpent). The economic system consists
 largely of traditional agriculture. Land ownership and
 income are unevenly distributed. Shelter and health care
 are rudimentary. Elementary education is free for three
 years. School attendance is not high, and the literacy rate
 is approximately 20 percent.
 The Government of Nepal-has emphasized efforts to increase
 the economic growth rate and to build the communications
 and transportation networks required to integrate and
 develop isolated areas of the country. Nepalese decision
 makers in the past few years have reoriented their development
 
 
 803
 programs to deal more directly with rural poverty. This
 goal is given particular emphasis in the current budget,
 with projected expenditure increases of over 50 percent in
 fields such as agriculture, health, rural water and local
 government which tend to benefit the individual.
 The King has assumed the leadership of the economic develop-
 ment effort. His insistence that programs be spread among
 the four development regions, rather than concentrated in
 Kathmandu and the lowlands, tends to benefit the poorer
 areas of the country. Performance has been mixed, generally
 falling short of budget projections. In terms of the level
 and direction of actual expenditures, and also in the con-
 tinuing attention to issues such as land reform and anti-
 corruption measures, the government has established institu-
 tions to implement its policies and plans.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 The Monarchy as an institution and the Royal Family in
 their persons are considered to be above criticism. The
 Press and Publication Act permits the government to ban
 summarily any newspaper for overstepping this line. While
 this power is used infrequently, it does serve as a check
 on the local press, as does the dependence of newspapers on
 government advertising. The two principal daily papers--one
 Nepali, the other English--continue to be government organs.
 However, since May 1979, they have reported regularly on
 opposition activities and positions. In addition, numerous
 other newspapers carry on a spirited critique of government
 (as distinguished from Palace) actions. Foreign publica-
 tions may be banned in Nepal (but seldom are currently)
 if they publish articles that the government regards as
 offensive.
 The Nepalese take pride in their long tradition of religious
 tolerance, exemplified by Hindus and Buddhists worshipping
 in each others' shrines. Conversion from Hinduism or
 Buddhism is against the law. Castes are still recognized
 in Nepal, but under the law all persons are to be treated
 as equals regardless of caste. Social barriers, as distinct
 from legal ones, remain but the government is attempting to
 dismantle these as well.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no general restrictions on movement within the
 country or abroad, but the government exercises tight
 control over the issuance of passports, often restricts
 their validity to specified countries, and sometimes refuses
 to issue them.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The political system has been in flux since the May 24 Royal
 proclamation announcing a nationwide referendum on the
 basis of universal adult suffrage to decide whether to retain
 
 
 804
 a reformed version of the partyless Panchayat System or
 to adopt a multi-party system. While the ban on political
 parties remains in effect, the government is permitting
 politicians to campaign actively not only on the referendum
 issues but also on other political issues. A few political
 exiles have returned to Nepal without arrest, and opposition
 groups have publicized their views in a variety of fora,
 including the press and mass rallies. Finally, King
 Birendra announced December 16 that, even if the Panchayat
 system is upheld in the referendum, it will henceforth
 involve direct election of the National Legislature and
 selection of the Prime Minister by the Legislature.
 The advocacy and protection of the interests of special
 groups--e.g., women and labor--is the responsibility of
 the Class Organizations established under the Constitution.
 In general, these organizations appear ineffective, with
 little if any authority to act on behalf of their members.
 There are a number of restrictions on women's rights, both
 legal and traditional, and, women a=e underrepresented in economic
 and political life. The government made a number of
 changes in favor of women's rights in the legal code in
 1975 during International Women's Year, but implementation
 of these changes in the face of social resistance has been
 slow.
 While labor has few rights bk law, and trade unionism is
 technically ille~al, union-like activity is on the increase
 as workers in one trade after another have collectively
 pressed their demands. Moreover, the government in the
 context of the current political situation, is negotiating
 such union-like groups of workers. In 1979 the workers in
 the jute industry and other parts of the private sector
 staged successful strikes; in the most notable strike the
 government limited its role to that of honest broker.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The Department of State is aware of no request by a non-
 governmental human rights organization to visit since late
 1977, when Amnesty International representatives went to
 Nepal. In the past, Amnesty International has expressed
 concern about the human rights situation and the arrest of
 specific individuals. Some of these indivduals subsequently
 were released.
