 NE ZEALAND
 New Zealand has an exemplary record in the human rights
 field and is continuing to improve and broaden respect
 for human rights. New Zealand enjoys a firm tradition
 of democracy dating back to its founding in the 19th
 century. Universal suffrage, personal freedom,
 respect for minority rights, rule by law, humane
 treatment of prisoners, concern for the economically
 deprived, freedom of the press, free trade union
 affiliation, and freedom of religion are deeply
 ingrained principles of the society and are fundamental,
 unquestioned tenets in its governance.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is illegal under a long tradition of common law
 and case precedents. It is not practiced in New Zealand.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 All are illegal and not practiced. Capital punishment is
 illegal, and summary executions are unknown. Abuse of
 prisoners and use of excessive force by police are
 not condoned and the government has adequate procedures
 to deal with.them. Prison and detention facilities
 provide adequate shelter, food, and medical care.
 Prisoners' relatives and lawyers are allowed to visit
 them. There are no differences of treatment of prisoners
 based on type of conviction, social class, race, sex,
 or religion.
 c.. Disappearances
 Secret arrests, clandestine detentions, and abductions
 are unknown in New Zealand.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There are no political prisoners in New Zealand. Habeas
 corpus exists and is honored in practice. Preventive
 detention does not exist. Following arrest, persons
 must be charged promptly.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The law, which guarantees the right to a fair, public
 trial, is respected. Defendants are entitled to counsel,
 and have free access to him. Consultation between
 defendants and counsel may be held in private. The
 government does not harass defense counsel. Defendants
 are charged promptly after arrest and charges are stated
 formally and clearly.   Under New Zealand's legal system,
 defendants are able to call witnesses, present evidence,
 and cross-examine prosecution witnesses at trials and are
 
 
 669
 not subject to double jeopardy. The law of evidence
 protects the accused against self-incrimination. Courts
 are independent of executive or military control. There
 are no special courts to deal with political or security
 offenses. Civilians are not tried by military courts.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Private property can only be searched in conformity with
 the law, which requires a warrant issued by a magistrate.
 Forced entries have not been alleged credibly and no
 other violations of the home have occurred.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 New Zealand has a mixed economy, based mainly on pastoral
 farming. Meat and dairy and forest products are the
 principal exports. Light manufacturing, food processing,
 and services are the primary non-farm occupations.
 New Zealand has developed a highly effective system of
 social welfare that ensures that no person lacks adequate
 food, health care, or housing for any reason. Dependent
 children, old-age pensioners, university students, and
 the unemployed receive special financial assistance.
 There is no destitution in the country. Public education
 is compulsory to age 15 and is free through the secondary
 level. Fees for university education are very low and
 scholarships are widely available.
 Rights to private property are respected.
 New Zealand's society is one of the most egalitarian in
 the world. There is little social class distinction.
 Wealth and income are distributed very evenly. The
 majority of the population lives at a middle-income
 level. Workers earn wages sufficient to provide
 for human needs and a social security system ensures a
 minimum standard of living in post-employment years.
 Conditions in work places meet basic safety standards.
 Discrimination affecting enjoyment of basic
 economic rights does not exist. The New Zealand
 Human Rights Commission Act of 1977 prohibited
 discrimination on the basis of sex or marital status
 in the areas of employment, accommodation, education,
 the provision of goods or services, and access
 to public facilities. The Equal Pay Act of 1972 provided
 that a woman must receive wages equal to those of a man
 doing the same or substantially similar work for the same
 employer. The New Zealand Race Relations Act of 1971
 states that it is unlawful to discriminate against any
 person, or any relative or associate of any person,
 because of that person's color, race, ethnic, or national
 origin. The Act covers discrimination in the provision
 of goods and services, employment, provision of land,
 housing and other accommodation, and access to public
 places, vehicles and facilities. The Maoris, the
 original inhabitants of New Zealand, traditionally
 
 
 670
 have enjoyed fair and equal treatment under the law
 and from society at large.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These rights are guaranteed by a long tradition of common
 law cases. There is no censorship or control of the media
 by the government apart from legislated exceptions
 relating to pornographic and similar materials and laws
 against defamation. Opposition viewpoints are freely
 discussed in the media. Journalists and academics
 work unhindered. Public meetings are free of restrictions
 and no one is denied the right to assemble freely.
 Trade union rights are respected. Public sector
 employees generally are not prohibited from
 collective bargaining and striking but there are some
 limited exceptions. Professional groups are not
 harassed. All religions are practiced freely.
 There is no state religion, nor is advantage given
 to the adherents of any particular faith.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The right of voluntary repatriation is guaranteed.
 New Zealand has been responsive, within the limits of
 its resources, to the resettlement needs of refugees
 and has practiced a liberal asylum policy. All of the
 refugees admitted in the past year have arrived under
 the Indochina Refugee Program. Under that program, records
 by nationality are not kept. Arrivals by August 1, 1980
 from Indochina were 1,099 and a total of 1800 were expected
 for the year. The New Zealand government and private
 organizations have been generous in assisting the
 resettlement of refugees.
 There is complete freedom of internal and external
 travel, emigration, and repatriation to New Zealand.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The country has a multi-party parliamentary system.
 Suffrage is universal for persons 18 years of age and
 older. Voting rates are high and participation in
 political groups and organizations is common. Opposition
 groups have every opportunity to voice their opinions
 and no groups are denied political participation or
 suffrage. Problems of nationality, citizenship, or
 statelessness do not exist. Women have legal equality
 with men and participate freely in all phases of
 New Zealand life. Discrimination on the basis of sex is
 illegal and the government has taken positive steps
 described above to ensure that the rights of women
 are respected.

 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-goven ental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 There have been no requests for such investigations.
 New Zealand's commitment to protecting human rights
 and opposing discrimination is exemplified by its
 adherence to a number of United Nations conventions
 including:  (a) the International Covenant on
 Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; (b) the
 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;
 and Cc) the International Convention on the Elimination
 of All Forms of Discrimination.
 Numerous organizations exist in New Zealand to protect
 human rights and oppose various forms of discrimination.
 Prominent among these ere the New Zealand Council
 for Civil Liberties, the Citizens' Association for
 Racial Equality, the New Zealand Chapter of the
 International Commission of Jurists, and the
 National Organization of Women.
