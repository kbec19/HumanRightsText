 NEPAL
 Nepal is the world's only Hindu Kingdom. Its Constitution
 stipulates that the King (chief of state) is the sole source
 of authority for all government institutions. There are
 traditional and constitutional restraints on the King's powers,
 but he effectively rules as well as reigns. Political parties
 are formally banned, and elections are officially contested on
 an individual basis. Nevertheless, parties do exist and
 function more or less openly.
 The National Panchayat (legislature) consists of 112
 representatives elected directly on the basis of universal
 adult suffrage, and 28 appointed by the King. Legislation
 passed by the National Panchayat is sent to the King for his
 approval, without which it cannot become law. The Supreme
 Court can invalidate laws which it finds to be inconsistent
 with the Constitution. The National Panchayat selects the
 Prime Minister from its ranks. In turn, he appoints the
 Council of Ministers (cabinet). The Council, answerable to
 both the National Panchayat and the King, manages day-to-day
 government operations and advises the King. In 1983, for the
 first time, the Prime Minister was changed by a vote of no
 confidence.
 Internal security is maintained in the first instance by the
 national police and as necessary by the army. Owing to Nepal's
 meager communications facilities, local officials have a large
 degree of autonomy and exercise wide discretion in dealing
 with law and order issues.
 Nepal is one of the world's poorest countries. Over 90
 percent of its traditional and rural population is engaged in
 subsistence agriculture. Nepal maintained a self-imposed
 isolation until 1951, and economic development and the
 broadening of political participation have been government
 objectives only since that time. Nepal's limited
 communications facilitie  are an important constraint on its
 development.
 The human rights situation in Nepal in 1987 was essentially
 unchanged from 1986. The 1987 local elections were relatively
 peaceful and fair. The irregularities and disturbances
 reported appeared to be attributable to individuals involved
 in specific campaigns and not to any organized effort by the
 Government. The major concerns were over continued
 restrictions on freedom of the press and reports of severe
 mistreatment of prisoners. The number of political prisoners
 dropped considerably, as a large number of persons, imprisoned
 during the rash of bombings and the teachers' strike in 1985,
 were released in 1987. Prosecution of persons charged with
 proselytiza.iQn or conversion continued at about the same rate
 as in 1986. /
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no political killings reported. Three persons were
 arrested in 1987 in connection with the attempted assassination
 in 1986 of a journalist who was an outspoken critic both of
 the Government and of those involved in drug trafficking. One
 of the suspects was convicted of attempting to murder the
 
 
 1258
 NEPAL
 journalist, and although the trial was secret, it was widely
 speculated that the attempt was prompted by the suspects' ties
 to the drug trade, The other two are still on trial.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no-allegations of disappearances in 1987. Amnesty
 International's (AI) November 1987 Report on Nepal documents
 the disappearance of four men arrested in mid-1985. Despite
 efforts by their families to obtain writs of habeas corpus,
 the Government has not accounted for the missing men and has
 denied that they remained in custody.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 .  Treatment or Punishment
 There were continued persistent reports, particularly from
 remote areas, that police regularly use brutal methods to
 interrogate or intimidate prisoners, both criminal and
 political. In its November 1987 Report, Al expressed concern
 that the torture of criminal suspects is widespread and
 routine and that in -recent years two suspects are reported to
 have died in police custody as a result of torture. They were
 also concerned that the use of fetters, prohibited under the
 United Nations' standard minimum rules for the treatment of
 prisoners, is even more widespread in Nepal than is permitted
 legally under Nepal's Prison Act. The Government rarely has
 conducted active investigations into allegations of police
 brutality or acknowledged public concerns about its
 prevalence, and some officials privately admit that they are
 unable to control police excesses.
 Places of ,detention reflect the country's low standard of
 living. Jail conditions vary according to the crime committed
 and the person's status, but all prisoners have access to
 medical attention and to-the traditional Nepalese diet. They
 are usually permitted visitors and goods from the outside.
 Generally, political prisoners have fared better than those
 convicted of criminal acts. Separate facilities are
 maintained for women and for the criminally insane.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Public Security Act permits 9 months of preventive
 detention before charges must be filed if the detention order
 is issued~by a Zonal Commissioner or Chief District Officer,
 and up to 18,months' detention if the order is imposed by the
 central Government. It is alleged that some prisoners are
 released, and immediately rearrested for another 9 months
 without charges being filed. There are also reports that some
 people are held in prison after completion of their sentences
 and, in some cases, in defiance of Supreme Court orders. Some
 prisoners went on hunger strikes in 1987 to protest the
 failure to release them on time.
 Six leaders of the Tibetan community in Nepal were held under
 the Public Security Act during late October and early November,
 apparently as a preventive security measure during the summit
 meeting in Kathmandu of the South Asian Association for
 Regional Cooperation. All were released without charges
 having been filed. Approximately 20 Nepalis of Sikh origin
 were reported to have been similarly detained.
 Two National Panchayat members were arrested in 1987 in
 connection with their political activities. Both were
 
 
 1259
 NEPAL
 released after a short period of detention without charges
 having been filed or a trial held.
 For common crimes, a suspect must be brought before a court
 within 24 hours and must be informed of the general grounds
 for the arrest or be released. A 7-day extension may be
 granted for the completion of the police investigation. These
 rules are not strictly observed.
 Neither official exile nor forced labor is practiced in Nepal.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The law provides for the right to a public trial in most cases
 (some security and customs cases excepted), and this right is
 usually honored. Except for those held in preventive
 detention, the Constitution provides for the right to counsel
 and protection from double jeopardy and retroactive
 application of the law. These rights are not always
 respected. A number of defendants were convicted in 1987
 under the Destructive Crimes Act of 1985, which was
 promulgated after the bombings for which they were tried.
 There was also controversy over the fact that several of the
 defendants were tried in absentia.
 There are separate military and civilian courts. Military
 courts generally deal only with military personnel, but
 civilians may be tried in these courts for crimes involving
 the military. Lower court judges are appointed by the
 Goverment on the recommendation of the Judicial Service
 Commission, and higher court judges are appointed by the King
 on the recommendation of the Chief Justice of the Supreme
 Court. The Destructive Crimes Act and the State Offenses and
 Punishment Act provide for closed trials before specially
 constituted tribunals in cases of terrorism or treason.
 The judiciary is legally independent but-generally not
 assertive in challenging the executive. All lower court
 decisions (including acquittals) are subject to appeal, and
 the Supreme Court is the court of last appeal. The King may
 grant pardons and set aside judgments.
 The Government has acknowledged holding "political prisoners,"
 but there is no agreement in Nepal on the definition of the
 term, which in opposition usage may include editors, student
 activists, and convicted murderers. Current estimates of the
 number of political prisoners in Nepal's jails range from 58
 to more than 140. This is a considerable drop from the 1986
 totals, reflecting the release during 1987 of a large number
 of persons who had been in prison since the wave-of bombings
 and the teachers' strike in 1985.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government generally respects the privacy of the home and
 family, principles which are bolstered by Nepalese law and
 tradition. Except for those suspected of narcotics or
 security violations, search warrants issued by Chief District
 Officers are required before search and seizure. The
 correspondence of some foreigners and domestic nonconformists
 is opened with little attempt at concealment.

 NEPAL
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Under the Constitution, freedom of speech and of the press may
 not be exercised in support of a political party or "to the
 detriment of the common good," the monarch, or members of the
 royal family. In practice, this rule is widely interpreted to
 permit criticism of the Government but not of the monarch or
 of the royal family. Journals and newspapers deemed to have
 overstepped these guidelines have been closed down, and their
 employees have been detained under the Public Security Act or
 even the Treason Act. Journalists' groups complain of the
 uncertainty surrounding what may be found objectionable at any
 given time.
 In 1987 the Government closed 19 papers for printing
 objectionable material and arrested 9 editors and reporters
 for material they had written. All but one of these
 journalists were later released, as were several arrested in
 1986. Some newspapers challenged their closure in court 6nd
 were allowed to reopen, and at least one resumed publication
 under a new name.. Late in 1987, the Supreme Court ruled that
 under the amended Press and Publications Act the Government
 cannot suspend publication of newspapers, as it has frequently
 done in the past, but can only stop providing facilities to
 them. However, the Government's power to withdraw a
 newspaper's license remains unchanged, and an earlier court
 decision that paralleled the Supreme Court's ruling did not
 result in any fundamental change in the Government's treatment
 of the press.
 In August the editor, distributor, and print compositors of a
 widely read newspaper were arrested after the paper published
 an interview with a Hindu scholar who is a strong critic of
 the Nepalese system of government (the "partyless Panchayat"
 system). The paper was closed for violating the Press Act by
 publishing..objectionable material. The editor remains in jail
 on a charge of sedition, while the others arrested have been
 released on bail pending trial on charges of violating the
 Press and Publications Act. The scholar himself was never
 arrested.
 The two dailies with the largest circulation are government
 organs, but they carry some reports of opposition activities
 and criticism of the Government, as well as extensive coverage
 of the debates in the National Panchayat. A major complaint
 of the independent newspapers is that government advertising
 (and most private advertising) goes only to the two
 semiofficial papers. Nevertheless, the independent press
 continues to be fairly vigorous and candid in its criticism of
 government policies and motives.
 Foreign publications are seized or banned.when deemed to carry
 articles unfavorable to the Government or the monarchy.
 Several I-Ddian newspapers were banned for varying periods
 during 1986 and 1987, but the bans were lifted in October
 1987, just prior to the summit meeting in Kathmandu of the
 South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.
 The single radio service in Nepal, and the sole television
 station in Kathmandu (which began broadcasting in 1986), are
 run by quasi-public boards and avoid controversial topics.
 
 
 1261
 NEPAL
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Regulations permit local authorities to prohibit meetings,
 speeches, and posters if they are found not to be "for the
 convenience or good of the general public." These regulations
 are frequently invoked. The law forbids activities detrimental
 to the monarchy, to relations among the people, or to national
 security. All political parties are banned under the partyless
 Panchayat system, although in practice political party members
 are generally permitted to assemble privately and to express
 their views in the independent press.
 Regulations governing political activities are interpreted
 differently by loc l authorities in different areas of the
 country, and the decision whether to permit a political meeting
 is made on an ad hoc basis. Student groups, including those
 openly affiliated with the banned political parties, are
 allowed to contest campus elections. However, they are
 usually prevented from holding meetings or demonstrations off
 campus, and a number of student leaders are usually in jail at
 any given time.
 In its special report on Nepal issued in November, AI
 expressed its concern about the cases of journalists, trade
 union members, and students who have been jailed in Nepal for
 the nonviolent exercise of their right to freedom of
 expression And association.
 The Government banned trade unions in 1960. The Nepal Labor
 Organization (NLO), established by the Government, is the only
 organization officially permitted to perform trade union-like
 functions. There are some independent workers' associations
 which tend to be repressed by the Government when they become
 too active. The Government has continued to withhold
 recognition of the National Teachers' Association and has
 countered domestic and interpational pressures for its
 recognition by forming two separate secondary and primary
 school teachers' associAtions whose constitutions are
 structured in such a way as to minimize their political
 activities.
 There is a legal right to strike, provided that the strike is
 authorized by the NLO. In practice, the few strikes which are
 held are illegal wildcat actions. The NLO has not dalled a
 legal strike within the last 3 years. The NLO, however, often
 becomes'involved in mediating between strkers and employers
 after illegal strikes have begun.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The vast ,iajority of Nepalese are Hindus, though ther6is a
 sizeable.minority of Buddhlists. Religious iolerance is
 traditional, and the Constitution provides that "every person,
 having regard to the traditions, may pr6fess and practice his
 own re igibn -as handed down from ancient times." However, the
 Constitution also provides that "no person .sball be entitled
 -to convert another person from one religion to another." The
 legal code provides a maximum penalty of 1 year in'prisdn for
 any Hindu who converts to another religion and 3 to 6 years
 for any person who seeks to proselytize a Hindu. In 1987 5
 new 'cases were registered in which 9 people wexe charged with
 proselytization and 11 with conversion. One person was
 detained under the Public Security Act. Including cases
 initiated in prior years, approximately 120 persons remain
 under indictment in more than 40 separate cases. More than 70
 
 
 1262
 NEPAL
 defendants have been convicted but remain free on bail pending
 appeal. No one is currently serving a sentence for either
 offense.
 There have-been occasional allegations from some members of
 Nepal's small Christian minority of harassment which inhibited
 the free'practice of their religdon, even when they were not
 engaged in proselytizing. -In October police disrupted a
 Christian worship-service in a private home when they intruded
 to see who was pafticip~tihg. After the-service'.s conclusion
 they took all attending Nepalese citizen to the police
 station, where all Put eight were quickly released. The
 remaining eight were.eventually released on bail, after three
 were chiarged'withproselyti-zing'and five with conversion.
 d. Freedom Of-Movement Within the Cobntry, Foreign
 Travel,.Emigration,.and Repatriation
 There Iare- no restrictions on travel within the country for
 Nepalese citizens,'although foreigners are .restricted from
 traveling to several border areas. Nepalese-abroad are free
 to return home. There are no known cases of revocation of
 citizenship for political reasons.
 -Nepar has no state d repigee policy. In the past it has
 accepted and assimilated approximately 12,000 Tibetan refugees
 and, according to immigration officials, no refugee has ever
 -been forced to return to Tibet.
 Section 3 Respect f,.Pol Piti'cal  ights: The Right of Citizens
 "  to ChangeTheir Government
 Politicl legitimacy in Nepal flows from the King, not from
 the people, ,since the ConStituttQn'is bebtowed by the monarch
 rather than,..dopted by'the citizenry. Accordingly, the
 Constitution 'does not afford a mechanism through which
 citi-zens 466id legally change the governmental system in which
 the King plajs ar dntral 'role..
 Most Nepalese accept and support a central role for the
 monarch, either for religious reasons (the King is regarded
 as a relbcarnation of the Hindu god yishnu) or out of respect
 for brditd .' Many Nepalese als-o view the monarchy as the
 symbol o '4palese nationalism and a force that' unifies a
 nationof �isarate� thkic and linguistic communities. At the
 same ti'me, there'is s6listantial public support for the view
 that Nepal's future political development should follow
 democratic lines.
 The 1980 consti.tutional reforms restrgctured the nation's
 formal golftltial T'ramewdr to make officials more 'answerable
 to the voting' Oubfic.  Diredt 'election by universal adult
 suffr'age was intqnded to make National Panchayat members more
 sensitive t'o the need to be seen as representing the interests
 of'their 6dstituents in relationto the Government. The
 Governmeht was'made acdbuntible to the National Panchayat as
 well Vs to the King, and'in-1983, for the first time, the'
 Prime Minister Was changed by a vote of ho confidence.
 Within the National Panchayat, there is lively debate on many
 issues. However, the ban on political parties makes it
 difficult for public opinion to be represented and mobilized
 systematically. In the absence of political parties, the
 palace still effectively dominates the legislature.
 
 
 1263
 NEPAL
 The local elections held in 1987 were relatively peaceful and
 fair, and the reported-irregularities and disturbances"
 appeared to be attributable to individuals involved in
 specific campaigns, and not to any organized effort by the
 Government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are several human rights organizations in Nepal which
 work with AI and with regional human rights groups. Human
 rights activists disseminate their views in public meetings,
 newspapers, and pamphlets. There have been no reports of
 attempts to suppress them. Kdmbers of AI :visited Nepal in
 August, 1987, to conduct research-for their report 'on Nepal,
 which was issued in-November. Entitled -Nepal: A Pattern of
 Human Rights Violations," the report-expressed concern about
 the disappearance of several persons while in police custody,
 reports of torture of political and diminal detainees, the -
 continuing imprisonment of' person's without formal charge or
 trial, and the poor conditions-in the'prisons. .There has been
 no indication of any officia-l,or unofficial response-by the
 Government. The Government's normal practice is to ignore
 foreign-:references- to-human rights in Nepal and-avoid public
 statements on the subject.     -"
 Section:5 -Discrimination Based-on Race, Sex, Religion,   - -
 Language, or Soc-ial-Status
 Women in Nepal have the right to vote and to-hold property in
 their own name. Women's property rights have been enforced by
 the courts when cases are brought-to them, especially in the*
 Kathmandu area. However, women have yet-to enjoy their rights
 fully in-manyrural areas, where lack of knowledge or
 understanding of' the law is common and the weight of
 traditional~practiceand attitudes is'great.: A women's legal
 project'begun-in-1987 is attempting to address this problem.
 As a Hindu nation which began the development and
 modernization process barely 35 years ago, Nepalese society is
 suffused and shaped by the traditional caste system. Howevir,
 public discrimination on the basis of caste, and particularly
 the practice of untouchability, has been outlawed"nd is �
 officially discouraged. The spread of education is slowly
 reducing caste distinctions and increasing opportunities for
 lower socioeconomic groups. Politics,-as-reflected bythe
 national election results, continues to be dominated by the
 traditional- higher castes -Brahmins,zChetris, Newars), but the'
 representation of other castes is increasing.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The industrial sector is small, accounting for little more
 than 1 percent of Nepal's gross domestic product. The Nepal
 Factories and Factory Workers Act-of 1959, as amended, sets
 -minimum wage rates and working conditions, including special
 rules for women and.a minimum age of 14 years. Enforcement is
 spotty, however, and'there have been reports of child labor in
 match and cigarette factories.-The law establishes a standard
 workweek-of 44 hours and extensivestandards for occupational
 health and safety.
