 TURKEY
 Following a major escalation of political violence in the sum-
 mer of 1980 and amid prolonged paralysis, the Turkish armed
 forces took over the government on September 12. General
 Kenan Evren, Chief of the Turkish General Staff, and the heads
 of the armed services dissolved the Parliament (Grand National
 Assembly). Evren became head of state, and along with the
 four chiefs of the armed forces (Army, Navy, Air Force and
 Gendarmerie), acting as the National Security Council (NSC);
 assumed all legislative functions. On September 21, 1980, the
 NSC appointed Admiral (retired) Bulend Ulusu Prime Minister,
 and a cabinet consisting primarily of civilian technicians and
 a few retired military officers to administer the executive func-
 tions of the state. The September 12 action and subsequent
 moves by the military received broad approval among the citizens
 of Turkey, who had been growing increasingly insecure and fear-
 ful of terrorism.
 The new government extended martial law throughout the country
 (martial law had previously been in force in 20 of Turkey's 67
 provinces). On September 20, the Martial Law Act of 1971 was
 amended to provide martial law commanders with wide-ranging
 powers of control over the right to assemble, trade unions, and
 the press and other media.
 The new government emphasized that the armed forces took power
 only after it had become clear that the existing state mechanism
 was unable to cope with the increasing terrorism which had
 claimed more than 5,000 lives during the previous two years.
 The government also stated that its tenure in office would be
 temporary and transitional in nature. General Evren said that
 the main purpose of the military takeover is the reestablish-
 ment of a "secular republic, based on social justice, individual
 rights and freedoms, and human rights." The NSC has announced
 plans to call a constituent assembly to draft a new constitu-
 tion and make legal changes to correct the abuses that had
 occurred under the 1961 constitution. No date has been set for
 the convening of this assembly.
 The Turkish military, traditionally viewed by Turks as the
 guarantor of the constitution, intervened twice before (1960
 and 1971). In both cases, hormal civilian rule was restored in
 about two years.
 On October 27, 1980, the NSC promulgated a "Law on the Constitu-
 tional Order" stipulating that the 1961 constitution will remain
 in force, except that the legislative and executive functions
 are to be exercised by the NSC and General Evren, respectively,
 until the new constitution is approved. No date has been set.
 1.   Respect for the integrity of the Person, Including Freedom
 from:
 a. Torture
 Article 243 of the Turkish Criminal Code and Article 4 of the
 1961 constitution forbid torture and provide severe punishments
 for offenders. There have been allegations that police offi-
 cials have violated these provisions on several occasions both
 before and after the military takeover on September 12. On
 June 9, 1980, Amnesty International (AI) issued a news release
 stating that torture in Turkey was "widespread and systematic"
 and included a listing of specific methods used. The government
 immediately expressed its regret at the charges, and undertook to
 investigate them.

 Since September 12, there have been reports of police brutality.
 Some instances of torture are alleged to have occurred during
 and subsequent to the mass arrests which followed the military
 takeover. There is no evidence that brutality and torture are
 widespread or systematic, or condoned as a matter of policy.
 Such activities are opposed by the government. A few police
 and penal officials have been arrested by the new government on
 charges of mistreatment which resulted in the death of suspects.
 The most prominent recent case involved Ilhan Erdost, a pub-
 lisher who was reportedly beaten and died while in military cus-
 tody. The government has stated its willingness to investigate
 all cases of alleged prisoner abuse.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Article 11 of the 1961 constitution states: "No punishment in-
 compatible with human dignity shall be inflicted." There have
 been no sunary executions.
 Prisons in Turkey are often overcrowded and inadequate. There
 appears to be no different treatment accorded prisoners on the
 basis of the type of convictions handed down or on the basis of
 social class, race, sex, or religion.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no reports of unexplained disappearances. Mar-
 tial law provisions allow persons to be held up to 30 days with
 a possibility of extension to 90 days before they are released
 or formal charges made. Turkish law does not provide for noti-
 fication of a detainee's next of kin until that person is for-
 mally charged. However, it has been common practice since Sep-
 tember 12 that not only the next of kin but also the press are
 made aware of persons arrested under the martial law provisions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Under martial law, a person may be detained without charge for
 30 days and that period may be extended to 90 days.
 There is no provision for habeas corpus in Turkish law but,
 according to Article 30 of the constitution, those wrongfully
 detained by the authorities "shall be indemnified by the State
 according to law." Preventive detention (Article 30) is allowed
 for "individuals against whom there exists a strong indication
 for indictment" in order to prevent "escape, destruction of or
 alteration of evidence." Under martial law a person can be held
 in this manner for 90 days without charges being brought.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials in civil and military courts generally are conducted
 under the same procedural rules. Trials are open, and defen-
 dants are allowed to have lawyers of their own choosing. There
 are appeals procedures in both instances. Appeals from martial
 law court verdicts go to the military court of appeals, while
 civil courts of appeal review the findings of lower courts.
 Since September 12, all accused terrorists are tried in martial
 law courts, including those accused of terrorism committed three
 months prior to the proclamation of martial law.
 The 1961 constitution guarantees the independence of the Turkish
 judiciary. Thus far, the new government has not curtailed that
 independence, except for limiting the constitutional review
 functions of the higher courts pending the approval of a new
 constitution.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 . The declaration of martial law throughout Turkey after Sep-
 tember 12 authorizes the search of private property without a
 warrant in the interest of national security. There have been
 no reports of widespread use of this authority.

 2. Government    Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 In the late 1970's, Turkey's economy, which had enjoyed impres-
 sive growth rates, ran into serious difficulties. The result
 was a series of enormous deficits in the balance of payments,
 a cessation of bank loans from abroad, severely curtailed im-
 ports, scarcities, three-digit inflation, plummeting produc-
 tion and 25 percent unemployment by 1980. In January 1980,
 the government launched a stabilization program designed to
 deal with these problems, and to begin a process of structural
 reform to move the economy toward a more open and competitive
 system. By late summer, the inflation rate was down to an
 annual rate of about 40-45 percent. The present government has
 pledged to continue the stabilization program.
 The threats to the economic rights of the Turkish people in
 recent years have been a runaway inflation which has had a
 heavy impact on wage earners and salaried white-collar workers,
 an inequitable tax system, and the terrorist violence and ex-
 tortion which have threatened worker and manager alike.
 However, even under the worst economic conditions of the past
 few years, Turks have enjoyed the right to ownership of prop-
 erty and have had a standard of living generally adequate to
 meet basic needs of nutrition, health, and education. Turkey
 generally has maintained its self-sufficiency in food. The popu-
 lation is adequately fed. The government is attempting to
 achieve a better rural-urban balance by decentralizing industry
 and providing better social infrastructure in remote areas to
 stem the flood of young people to the big cities. With annual
 population growth in the neighborhood of 2.5 percent, almost
 one million new workers may be entering the active labor force
 annually.
 In 1979, the rate of real growth in the gross national product
 (GNP) continued the decline begun in 1976. At 0.2 percent,
 real 1979 economic growth was considerably less than Turkey's
 annual rate of population increase.
 According to unofficial estimates, about 15 percent of the total
 population gets 50 percent of the national income while the
 remaining 85 percent gets the other 50 percent. There has re-
 portedly been little or no change over the years in the respec-
 tive shares of national income received by the upper 20 percent/
 lower 20 percent of the population.
 The education share in the 1980 national budget law was 11.7
 percent, up from 11.3 in 1979. Health was 4.2 percent in the
 1980 budget, down from 4.3 percent in 1979. According to a
 1977 figure, there is a national average of one doctor for 1,759
 persons in Turkey. The number of doctors (specialists and prac-
 titioners) increased 100 percent from 1967 to 1977, while the
 number of registered nurses more than tripled. Primary schooling
 is compulsory and all levels of education, including the uni-
 versity, are free. However,there are entrance examinations for
 universities since the number of university applications great-
 ly exceeds the present capacity of these institutions of higher
 learning, which now number 18. From 1965 to 1975, the percen-
 tage of persons (6 yedrs and older) considered literate increas-
 ed from 48 percent to 61.7 percent. There is no known discrim-
 ination which would prevent Turks of whatever background from
 gaining the fruits of their labors.
 Under the law, women and men have equal rights. Women are found
 in the medical, legal, journalistic, engineering, dental, bank-
 ing, architectural, and other professions. They have access to
 the universities. Nevertheless, women are subject to social and
 cultural restraints which keep them from full equality. Such
 restraints are more pronounced in rural rather than urban areas.

 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The existence of martial law has inhibited the exercise of
 free speech, press and assembly. The September amendments
 to the 1971 Martial Law Act authorize martial law commanders
 to control all publications and communications carried out
 orally, in writing, in pictures, recordings, letters, tele-
 grams, and all other postal material.
 Under martial law, prior censorship is not imposed, but the
 press is required to exercise self-censorship. The new
 government has suspended the publication of two newspapers.
 The government is working to "depoliticize" the education
 system whose institutions, prior to September 12, had
 become battlegrounds for contending ideologies from both the
 extreme right and the extreme left. The Martial Law Act per-
 mits the dismissal of public servants and workers, including
 teachers, whose activities are considered detrimental to law
 and order. No universities have been closed, but some stu-
 dents have been expelled for alleged involvement in radical
 political activities.
 On September 12, a temporary ban on the activities and meet-
 ings of all associations--including political parties and pro-
 fessional groups and social-service clubs like Rotary--was
 imposed. On October 8, the government partially lifted this
 ban, permitting those associations "which work within their
 statutes and those which are for the good of the community"
 to continue their activities, upon application to and approval
 by the local martial law commanders. The Martial Law Act also
 requires permission for rallies and marches to be held.
 The September 20 Amendments to the Martial Law Act empower
 martial law commanders to prohibit strikes or impose a permit
 requirement for unions to strike. The amendments also give
 the commanders the power to prevent worker boycotts, slowdowns,
 or employee lockouts. DISK, Turkey's leftist labor federation,
 and the rightist labor federation MISK have had their assets
 blocked and activities suspended since September 12. TURK-IS,
 Turkey's largest labor federation, has for the most part been
 allowed to continue its activities. Many labor leaders were
 taken into custody on September 12. Some have been released.
 Under legislation passed by the NSC, federations and unions
 whose activities have been suspended will have trustees appoint-
 ed to handle their financial and other affairs under the sur-
 veillance of martial law commanders.
 Turkey is a secular state, although Islam commands the alle-
 giance of the overwhelming majority of its population. Article
 19 of the 1961 constitution specifically provides that every
 individual has "freedom of religious faith." In the case of
 non-Muslim minorities--Armenians, Greek Orthodox, and Jews--
 that freedom is further guaranteed by the 1923 Treaty of Lau-
 sanne.
 Cases of petty and official discrimination undoubtedly exist in
 Turkey, particularly with respect to access to certain military
 and civil service jobs. Some minorities complain of instances
 of failure of lower level government officials to provide basic
 services to their schools or community institutions. Allega-
 tions of persecution of non-Turkish minorities do not appear
 to be supported by the available evidence.
 Women in Turkish society are subject to a certain amount of
 social and economic discrimination but have the same political
 rights as men. Prior to September 12 a few women held minis-
 terial positions or seats in the parliament. No woman is a
 member of Turkey's present cabinet, although one is a member of
 the Supreme Court. Since the adoption in 1926 of the Turkish
 
 
 891
 Civil Code, Turkish males may have only one wife at a time.
 Divorce is permitted, with women acting as plaintiffs as often
 as men.
 While women have made great strides in Turkey, certain anoma-
 lies persist. According to one estimate, twenty percent of
 adult Turkish males are classified as illiterate while about
 half of all Turkish women fall into that category.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration and Repatriation
 Turkey has accepted many refugees from Iran and Afghanistan and
 provided them with temporary non-immigrant status in Turkey for
 renewable periods of three months.
 Turkey permits the voluntary repatriation of Turkish residents
 from abroad, such as returning "guest workers" from West Germany
 and other Western European countries. There is freedom of in-
 ternal movement, subject only to martial law restrictions. Free-
 dom of emigration is permitted but due to severe foreign exchange
 shortages, foreign travel for the purpose of tourism has been
 limited to one trip abroad every three years and one trip each
 year to the northern area of Cyprus.
 In all of the above categories, there are no indications that
 women or other groups are subjected to different rules.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 This freedom has been suspended since September 12, pending
 further steps to restore civilian rule. Prior to September 12,
 there was active and free participation in the political pro-
 cess. Promptly after the September 12 takeover, Prime Minister
 Suleyman Demirel of the Justice Party (JP), Bulent Ecevit, lead-
 er of the Republican People's Party (RPP), Necmettin Erbakan,
 leader of the National Salvation Party (NSP), and Alpaslan
 Turkes, head of the Nationalist Action Party (NAP), were taken
 into custody by the new military government. In addition, near-
 ly 100 former members of the parliament were held for varying
 periods of time for investigations into past activities. On
 October 11, after the 30 days detention then permitted by mar-
 tial law, Demirel and Ecevit, the leaders of the two main poli-
 tical parties, were released. Erbakan and Turkes, however,
 along with many of their parliamentary and party colleagues,
 were indicted on charges that they sought to undermine the
 foundations of the Turkish state, and, in the case of Turkes
 and his followers, promoted acts of violence. Of the other
 parliamentarians who were in custody, most have been released.
 Some are being tried for prior minor offenses and individual
 criminal activities for which they could not be tried when
 parliamentary immunity was still in force prior to September 12.
 Some of these former parliamentarians have been convicted but
 thus far most have been acquitted. Non-Turkish minorities and
 all Turks of diverse ethnic backgrounds have been allowed equal
 participation in the political process.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 The new military-installed government has not yet established a
 record in this respect. Prior to September 12, there were no
 nationwide organizations that monitored the human rights situa-
 tion in Turkey, although Amnesty International still has a
 national section in Turkey. An Amnesty International mission
 visited Turkey from May 19-30, 1980, and apparently did not
 encounter any interference from the Turkish government then in
 power. In October, the Chairman of the North Atlantic Assembly
 Political Committee visited Ankara. He met with officials of
 
 
 892
 the government and with RPP leader Ecevit and JP leader
 Demirel. As a result of deliberations at the Council of
 Europe in October 1980, the Turkish government has indicated
 that Council "fact finding teams" will be welcome to visit
 Turkey.
 In light of the Turkish military intervention in 1974 and the
 continued presence of Turkish armed forces in northern Cyprus,
 Turkey shares responsibility for the human rights situation on
 the island. The report relating to Cyprus addresses this ques-
 tion.
