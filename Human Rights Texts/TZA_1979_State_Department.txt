 TANZANIA
 Tanzania continues to be a major spokesman against abuses of
 human rights internationally and especially in Africa.
 President Nyerere was one of the few African leaders to
 condemn publicly the gross human rights violations per-
 petrated by former Ugandan President Idi Amin, former
 Central African Emperor Bokassa and former Equatorial
 Guinea President Macias. He has also been a major advocate
 of majority rule in southern Africa. It is noteworthy in
 human rights terms that people generally flee into Tanzania,
 not out of it, and there are now more than 170,000 refugees
 in Tanzania.
 The emphasis in Tanzania's domestic policy is on social and
 economic egalitarianism rather than freedom for the indi-
 vidual. This has resulted in human rights abuses in the
 past, but there are indications that the record has improved
 in recent years. The country is a one-party parliamentary
 republic which adheres to a national policy of socialism and
 self-reliance. The single party and the government restrain
 political debate, and stress is placed on the people's
 economic rather than political rights. When policy differ-
 ences arise, they are expressed within the party or govern-
 ment organs rather than publicly.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture has been used on occasion in the past to extract
 information but it is not a routine police practice. The
 Department of State has no information either alleging or
 confirming the use of torture during 1979. According to
 Tanzanian law, a person accused of a crime may confess only
 to a magistrate, and confessions obtained from an accused in
 any other manner must be restated before a magistrate. In
 recent years the government has sought to restrain investi-
 gative officials who used torture and to punish violators.
 Two ministers and several other officials were forced to
 resign in January 1977 on the grounds that police under
 their supervision (but without their knowledge) had tortured
 suspects. In mid-1978 two police officers were convicted of
 having tortured a suspect in their custody.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Prisons are seriously overcrowded and often have inade-
 quate facilities. This was somewhat alleviated in April
 when Tanzania granted amnesty on humanitarian grounds
 to more than 6400 convicted prisoners. With the release
 in December of 14 Zanzibaris, all those charged with par-
 ticipation in the 1972 attempt to overthrow the President
 of Zanzibar have been freed. The death penalty has rarely
 been implemented. The government often has failed to
 provide notice to relatives or foreign governments in case
 of arrest of foreign citizens. Although the government
 acknowledges its responsibility for notifying foreign
 embassies, it needs to exert stronger, more rapid enforce-
 ment of this responsibility on the bureaucracy.

 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 National security laws empower the government to detain
 indefinitely, without trial or public hearing, any individ-
 uals considered dangerous to the safety, good order, or
 interest of the country. Precise figures on the number of
 detainees are unavailable and sufficient information is
 lacking upon which to make a firm estimate. In its 1978
 annual report, Amnesty International guessed the number of
 detainees to be "some hundreds."
 The Department of State agrees with Amnesty International
 that most detainees are imprisoned for criminal rather than
 political reasons. Amnesty International stated that among
 the small number of detainees known to it, only two could be
 categorized as political prisoners. One of them, Gray
 Mattaka, was released early in 1979.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Prosecution and the threat of prosecution are reportedly
 used against some opponents of the government. Occasionally
 such cases are kept pending for long periods, even when
 the government might have realized the likelihood of an
 eventual acquittal. In non-political cases the right to a
 fair, public trial is respected.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Suspected government opponents are subject to arbitrary
 search of their homes, but this is not a common occur-
 rence. Anti-corruption squads also have the right of
 search.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The government attaches a high priority to its expansion
 of public services to better meet the basic human needs
 of its large rural population. To this end the government
 has engaged in a rapid and costly expansion of primary
 education, constructed and staffed rural dispensaries, and
 devoted a major effort to improving village water supplies.
 Tanzania also has given priority to expanded food production
 and, with favorable weather, has recently made substantial
 gains in its harvests of maize and other food crops.
 Enrollment in primary schools has increased from 765,000
 students in 1968 to nearly three million students in 1978.
 Secondary school enrollment increased from 28,000 to 42,000
 students during the same period. Rural health center beds
 were nearly doubled between 1972 and 1978 to the level
 of 4,170 beds. Hospital dispensary beds were increased
 during the same period by some 4,000 beds to reach a total
 of nearly 30,000 beds country-wide. The projected central
 government development budget for 1979/80 is $777 million of
 which nearly one-fourth is to be allocated to social infra-
 structure (e.g., health, education and public administra-
 tion). The government has moved people from widely dis-
 persed housing locations into village centers where better
 health care, education and water supply can be provided.
 This movement, in many instances by force, caused some
 suffering, resentment and economic dislocation in rural
 
 
 areas. In recent years, the government has tempered its
 approach to such relocation and taken a more pragmatic
 attitude toward private farming. Corruption, although petty
 by standards in some countries, is widespread and contri-
 butes to the difficulties which the government faces in
 attempting to achieve rapid economic development on egali-
 tarian terms.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Tanzania carefully observes freedom of religion, but other
 civil and political.liberties are subordinated to the
 attempt to achieve socialist goals and national "self-
 reliance." Political assembly is authorized only when
 the purpose is consistent with party and government poli-
 cies. Circulation of foreign books and magazines is per-
 mitted, but local media and educational institutions present
 a single point of view on major policy questions. Public
 dissent from basic policies and ideology is strongly dis-
 couraged outside the framework of the competition for views
 within the ruling party. There is, however, criticism in
 "Letters to the Editor" columns and elsewhere of government
 shortcomings such as bureaucratic inefficiencies.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on internal travel, although
 occasionally the urban unemployed are forcefully relocated
 to agricultural employment. Passports for foreign travel
 are issued only when the government is satisfied that the
 purpose of travel is not detrimental to national interests.
 Emigration is not obstructed by government regulation.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 In Tanzania's one-party socialist system, opposition par-
 ties are not permitted. Freedom to participate in the
 political- process is limited to activity within the official
 party organization. About half of Parliament is directly
 elected by universal suffrage. The remaining members are ex
 officio, appointed by the President, or elected indirectly-
 bylPar iament. Candidates for Parliament or elected party
 office must be approved by senior party officials. Member-
 ship in the party, the only avenue to political participa-
 tion, is open only to ideological adherents and is currently
 held by less than half of those eligible.
 The Tanzanian government recognizes the principle of equal
 rights for women. In the present cabinet two ministers are
 women, one regional commissioner (equivalent to a governor)
 is a woman, and last year the first Tanzanian woman was
 appointed ambassador. The role of women in the party is
 influential (five on the central committee) although not in
 proportion to their numbers. The government's policy of
 promoting the equality of women must overcome historical
 and religious traditions of much of the population.
 The Union of Tanzania Workers (JUWATA) is the sole legal
 trade union in the country. It is essentially controlled
 by the government; President Nyerere appoints the Secretary
 
 
 208
 General and his two deputies. However, JUWATA carries on
 active and vigorous negotiations with employers, both
 government and private, in such areas as working conditions
 and grievances. JUWATA has the legal right to strike but
 only after a number of conditions are met. Legal strikes
 are, therefore, extremely rare.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 Representatives of the International Committee of the
 Red Cross visited Tanzania in 1978. We understand that
 ICRC representatives in 1979 had some initial difficul-
 ties in gaining access to POWs incarcerated in Tanzania
 as a result of the Uganda war. All 57 Libyan soldiers
 captured by the Tanzanian army during the 1978-79 Uganda-
 Tanzanian conflict were repatriated to Libya in 1979. The
 release of a number of detainees and the release of all
 prisoners held in the Zanzibar treason case subsequent to an
 ICRC visit seem to indicate that Tanzania is not insensitive
 to the scrutiny of such organizations. The Department of
 State is not aware of any recent requests by international
 or non-governmental organizations to investigate the human
 rights situation in Tanzania.
