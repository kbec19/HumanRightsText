CAMBODIA
Cambodia’s human rights record during 2001 included progress on some
issues as well as several disappointing setbacks. By mid-November, Cambodia
was close to becoming the first Southeast Asian country to ratify the Rome
Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), but the government continued
its efforts to dilute the power of a tribunal to bring the Khmer Rouge to justice.
While advocacy organizations benefited from relaxed policies on freedom of association,
political violence increased. The government risked angering its long-time
ally Vietnam by affording temporary asylum to ethnic minority asylum seekers
from Vietnam, thereby meeting its obligations as a signatory to the 1951 Refugee
Convention. At the same time, provincial Cambodian officials periodically
deported dozens of asylum seekers back to Vietnam, violating the fundamental
principle of non-refoulement. Prison conditions remained poor and torture continued
to be used by police and prison officials with impunity. Social and environmental
rights increasingly emerged as an issue.Hundreds of villagers organized to
protect community fisheries, forests, and other natural resources from abusive
exploitation by government agencies or officially sanctioned companies.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Political violence increased and preparations began for long overdue local elections,
scheduled for February 2002 in Cambodia’s 1,600 communes,or subdistricts.
In the elections, existing commune chiefs, mostly appointed by the ruling Cambodian
People’s Party (CPP), were to be replaced with popularly elected commune
councils. In September, the Cambodian Human Rights Action Committee, a coalition
of eighteen nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), documented eighty-two
cases of political threats and violence since the beginning of the year, most of them
directed at the opposition Sam Rainsy Party (SRP).
By November, at least four likely commune candidates had been shot dead and
two others wounded. SRP commune candidate Uch Horn was killed on June 30 in
Kompong Speu.He had previously complained to two local human rights organizations
and the U.N. that he had received death threats. On July 1, Soeung Sem, a
commune candidate for the royalist Funcinpec Party, survived a shooting in Pursat,
but Funcinpec candidate Meas Soy was shot and killed on July 17 in Kompong
Chhnang. SRP activist Toch Savoeun was shot and killed on August 23 by two
unidentified gunmen at his home in Siem Reap. On November 5, SRP candidate
Sam Sophear was beaten to death by five unknown assailants in Battambang.While
Cambodian human rights groups and the Cambodia Office of the U.N.High Commissioner
for Human Rights (COHCHR) determined that at least three of the
killings were politically motivated, local officials attributed the murders to personal
disputes.
In August, after a barrage of criticism from donor countries, human rights
groups and the U.N., the government established a Central Security Office comprising
representatives from the interior and defense ministries, national police,
military, and the National Election Commission (NEC), to address electoral violence.
By mid-November, the office was still inactive.
There were reports of vote buying as early as August. The Committee for Free
and Fair Elections (Comfrel), a Cambodian NGO, reported that CPP activists in
Takeo and Banteay Meanchey provinces were promising gifts to voters in exchange
for pledges of loyalty to the CPP. In September, Comfrel reported widespread confiscation
of voter registration cards by CPP officials and accused the CPP of pressuring
people in many provinces to sign documents pledging to vote for the CPP.
Local authorities and in some cases uniformed police officers carried out voter
opinion surveys on behalf of the CPP, distributing forms with lists of names and
photographs of possible candidates. Election monitoring NGOs charged that this
was in violation of the Commune Election Law, which calls for government institutions
to be politically neutral.
Moves Toward a Khmer Rouge Tribunal
Progress toward establishing a tribunal to bring former members of the Khmer
Rouge to justice was slow. In July 2000, the government had agreed on legislation
with the U.N. that would establish a “mixed tribunal” presided over by both Cambodian
and international judges and co-prosecutors.However, the legislation sent
to the Cambodian National Assembly in January 2001 differed markedly from what
had been agreed on, most notably deleting the provision that prior amnesties
would not be a bar to prosecution. This had been designed to ensure that key
people, such as former Khmer Rouge Foreign Minister Ieng Sary, granted a royal
pardon in 1996, could still be brought to justice.
The U.N.’s Office of Legal Affairs sent a strongly worded letter to the Cambodian
government in January, calling for clarifications or changes to seventeen of the
forty-eight articles in the draft law. In June, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
stressed that the Cambodian law should accord with the previous agreements, but
Prime Minister Hun Sen’s response was that Cambodia would conduct its own tribunal
if the U.N. refused to participate.
In August, the National Assembly passed the tribunal legislation as proposed by
the government.By October, the U.N. had still to agree and sign a Memorandum of
Understanding with the Cambodian government, one of the final steps toward
actually establishing the court. It was clear, however, that former members of the
Khmer Rouge were becoming apprehensive. In August, the Democratic National
Union Movement (DNUM), a group loyal to Ieng Sary, urged the government not
to prosecute their leader, and former Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan issued
a seven-page public letter in which he offered an unusual apology to the Cambodian
people.
Cambodia’s judicial system remained weak and far from independent, with
numerous court decisions influenced by corruption or apparent political influence.
The high-profile trials in June and October of sixty alleged members of the Cambodian Freedom Fighters (CFF) fell short of international standards for fairness.
Most of the defendants were arrested without warrants and had little or no access
to their lawyers while in pre-trial detention, which exceeded the legal limit of six
months. After the first day of the trial of the first thirty-two defendants in June,
most of the lawyers for the accused boycotted the proceedings, citing breaches of
proper procedures. Five lawyers subsequently received anonymous threats of violence
against them if they did not return to the courtroom. The judge appointed
two new lawyers to act for all of the accused, and refused to delay the hearing, leaving
these lawyers with no opportunity to meet their clients or prepare an adequate
defense. On June 22, all but two of the first group of accused were convicted of terrorism
and membership in an illegal armed group, and given sentences ranging
from three years to life in prison.Another twenty-six defendants were convicted in
the October trial.
In September 2001,more than fifty additional CFF suspects were arrested in the
provinces and Phnom Penh.Human rights groups expressed concern that the government’s
response to the CFF’s November 2000 attack in Phnom Penh could be
used as a pretext to intimidate opposition party members, particularly as the commune
election campaign began to get underway.
Two political killings resulted in trials. On March 15, the Kampot provincial
court found commune chief Im Nan, a CPP member, and three accomplices guilty
of the murder of Funcinpec commune candidate Pak Choeun in June 2000. On
October 12, a former soldier, Sang Rin, and another accused were convicted of the
murder of SRP member Uch Horn at a trial in the Kompong Speu provincial court.
In both cases rights groups held that the murders were politically motivated; the
courts, however, attributed both murders to retaliation for the victims’ alleged use
of “black magic.”
Refugee Influx
Beginning in March, a slow but steady stream of refugees from Vietnam entered
Cambodia’s eastern Mondolkiri and Ratanakiri provinces. They were indigenous
minority people from Vietnam’s Central Highlands, known collectively as Montagnards,
who were displaced by a Vietnamese government crackdown in February.
(See Vietnam.) On March 23, Cambodian police arrested twenty-four
Montagnards in Mondolkiri and took them to the municipal Gendarmerie headquarters
in Phnom Penh,where they detained them for several weeks. Prime Minister
Hun Sen initially threatened to deport the group, saying he did not want
Cambodia to become a haven for other countries’ political opponents. After considerable
international pressure, Cambodia agreed to allow United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) representatives to interview the Montagnards
on March 31, and by April, thirty-eight Montagnards were resettled in the
United States.
In the following months, more than 1,000 Montagnards crossed the border to
Cambodia. Provincial officials forcibly returned several hundred back to Vietnam
and in May attempted to arrest and deport several refugees under UNHCR protection.
After negotiations between UNHCR and the government, and pressure from several foreign embassies,Cambodia agreed to provide temporary asylum to Montagnards
fleeing Vietnam at two sites operated by UNHCR.As of October, the number
of Montagnards asylum seekers in Cambodia had swelled to more than seven
hundred.
Unlike in neighboring Laos and Vietnam, recent years have seen the development
of a thriving civil society in Cambodia and the emergence of hundreds of
local NGOs.The government generally does not obstruct public meetings. In June,
however, the Council of Ministers banned a public forum on the country’s border
disputes, organized by the Students Movement for Democracy, on grounds that it
could confuse the public by raising disagreements with the government’s National
Committee on Border Disputes.
For the most part, rallies and demonstrations were allowed, although demonstrators
were sometimes dispersed by police or by counter-demonstrators organized
by the government. As in previous years, hundreds of farmers from the
countryside periodically gathered in front of the National Assembly to demand resolution
of land or fishing conflicts or appeal for flood and food relief. In February,
scuffles broke out in Siem Reap at the SRP’s annual congress, when counterdemonstrators
were trucked in to disrupt the proceedings. Police used water cannons
to disperse a Buddhist ceremony organized to mark the end of the SRP’s
congress, reportedly because the SRP lacked proper authorization to hold the ceremony.
In May, more than seven hundred market vendors in Siem Reap demonstrated
against a provincial decision to evict them from the provincial market and construct
a new market where vendors would be charged higher rents. Cambodian
human rights groups urged the provincial authorities to organize a public forum to
resolve the dispute. Instead, on July 9, police and soldiers surrounded the market,
firing in the air and forcibly removed the vendors, at least fourteen of whom were
beaten, handcuffed and temporarily detained by provincial military police. Several
SRP parliamentarians observing the process were also assaulted. In August, Hun
Sen supported a proposal for negotiations to resume between the vendors and representatives
of the market developers.
Cambodian television stations were still owned fully or partly by the government,
which continued to deny a broadcast license to the opposition SRP on the
grounds that no frequencies were available. In February, Sam Rainsy announced
plans to start broadcasting a one-hour radio program from an un-named Asian
country. Only one independent radio station, Sambok Kmum (Beehive), broadcast
during the year. The NEC’s media monitoring subcommittee primarily focused on
the political content of voter education materials produced by election NGOs,
rather than the denial of access to the airwaves by opposition parties during the
election campaign. NGO leaders were occasionally featured on radio and television
programs to discuss social issues.
More than two dozen privately owned newspapers were published, including
some affiliated with opposition groups. Foreign Minister Hor Nam Hong sued
three journalists from the English-language Cambodia Daily for defamation after
they published an article in January that examined his alleged role in the Khmer
Rouge regime. In September, the Phnom Penh municipal court ordered the journalists to pay U.S. $6,500 in compensation to Hor Nam Hong and a $1,280 fine to
the government.Both sides appealed the decision. In August, the Ministry of Information
banned a Khmer-language book written by Sam Rainsy entitled “Light of
Justice,” saying that it made false allegations about the government. In response,
Rainsy filed a complaint against the banning in the Phnom Penh municipal court
in September.
The Ministry of Information revived a media subdecree, in the works since
1996. It included provisions for the licensing of newspapers and defined vague
terms used in the 1994 Press Law, including national security and political stability.
As a result of pressure from journalist associations and human rights groups, several
provisions were dropped from the original draft subdecree, including requirements
that publishers certify that they have 2.5 million riel (about U.S. $640) in the
bank and health certificates showing they have no mental problems.
Freedom of expression came under threat in September, when the Ministry of
Cults and Religion issued a decision forbidding political discussions in the
country’s mosques following the September 11 attacks in the United States as well
as a controversial leadership split in a mosque near Phnom Penh. In October,Hun
Sen reversed the ministry’s decision.
Prison conditions continued to be poor, with many facilities seriously overcrowded
and lacking adequate medical care, food, and water. At least six prisoners
died within a two-month period in Prey Sar prison in Phnom Penh because of
insufficient food and medication, according to a report by a Cambodian human
rights organization. The use of shackles was reported in prisons in Kompong Som
and Kompong Cham. Pre-trial detention beyond the legal limit of six months was
common.
Torture continued to be used with impunity, particularly by police officers
attempting to extract confessions from suspects in custody. Police also failed to
intervene to stop violence against women either in the home,where domestic abuse
was considered a family matter, or in the sex industry,which is often supported and
protected by members of the military, police or other government officials.
Cambodian human rights organizations increasingly gave attention to social
and environmental rights.Villagers filed complaints protesting the confiscation by
military officers and local officials of natural resources that rural communities
depend on for their livelihoods - such as bamboo, tree resin, and rattan. They also
protested the government’s granting of concessions to exploit such resources.Environmental
and human rights advocates worked to draft a Community Forest Subdecree
that would protect community user rights to forests that villagers rely upon
for collection of forest products. In April, the Department of Forestry issued an
instruction calling for the temporary suspension, in all forest concessions, of cutting
of all trees from which people collect resin.
Positive steps were taken during the year to protect community fisheries, on
which a huge percentage of Cambodians depend. In late 2000 Hun Sen announced
that fishing lots would be taken away from large concessionaires and returned to
local people. He subsequently dismissed the director of the Department of Fisheries
for not implementing the decision.The department involved local communities
in developing legislation to protect community fisheries, setting a positive
precedent for local participation in natural resource management. Despite these efforts, poor implementation of policies at the local level, reflected in the confiscation
of community fishing lots by fishery department officials, continued to pose a
problem in some areas.
Land conflicts also remained a major issue throughout the country. Legal Aid of
Cambodia (LAC), a local NGO, reported that its land-related caseload involved
7,000 families, or 35,000 people, with the vast majority of the conflicts involving
military commanders or provincial and local officials. In one high-profile case,
indigenous minority villagers in Ratanakiri province filed a lawsuit seeking to protect
their rights to 1,250 hectares of village land that they said had been fraudulently
obtained by a representative of a military general.Villagers were given bags of salt
and promises of development in return for their thumbprints on documents
that—without their knowledge—transferred ownership of their ancestral lands to
the general. In a decision in March, the Ratanakiri provincial court ruled against the
villagers’ civil complaint.With the help of LAC the villagers then took the case to
the Appeals Court in Phnom Penh, but it had not been heard by November. In July,
the National Assembly passed a new land law, drafted with the input of NGOs and
local communities, designed to stem the widespread practice of land grabbing.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Several dozen Cambodian human rights organizations were active throughout
the country investigating violations, monitoring prison conditions, observing trials,
and conducting human rights education. In addition, three large NGOs specializing
in election observation monitored voter registration and the commune
election process. Overall, the atmosphere for NGOs was less threatening than in
previous years. Several times during the year, however, public officials issued
strongly worded warnings to NGOs. In the months following the November 2000
CFF attack in Phnom Penh, human rights groups and their leaders came under
strong criticism from officials when the groups called for due process to be followed
in the arrests and trial of alleged CFF members. In several speeches Prime Minister
Hun Sen charged that NGOs were hiding terrorists “under their logos” and threatened
them with arrest.
Global Witness, which has served as an independent monitor within the government’s
Forest Crime Monitoring and Reporting project since 1999, came under
fire in January when it released a report critical of illegal logging and resource rights
abuses just prior to an international donor meeting. Government officials said
Global Witness should have given them the opportunity to review and comment on
the report before it was publicized.Prime Minister Hun Sen threatened to expel the
group from Cambodia but relented after pressure from donors. In June, Global
Witness signed an agreement with the government on new reporting procedures
shortly before the annual donor meeting.
In July, Hun Sen criticized the Human Rights Action Committee for its statements
deploring the rise in political violence. He said the burden of proof was on
the NGOs to show that the killings of commune candidates were politically motivated.
In October, the acting director of the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights (Licadho), a local human rights group, faced criminal
charges when a court accepted a complaint by the adoptive parents of a seven-yearold
girl whom Licadho was housing. Licadho previously had sought child abuse
charges against the adoptive parents and had been granted temporarily lawful custody
of the child. Cambodian and international rights groups expressed concern
that the initiation of criminal proceedings appeared to be without foundation and
aimed at intimidating Licadho.As of November, the case had not yet been heard.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
The Cambodia Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights
(COHCHR) maintained a field operation in Phnom Penh and several provinces.
The U.N. Secretary General’s Special Representative for Human Rights in Cambodia,
Peter Leuprecht,made several visits to Cambodia during the year, and called for
increased foreign aid while urging the government to address broad issues of
poverty, violence, corruption, and lawlessness. During Leuprecht’s June trip, he
expressed reservations about the Khmer Rouge tribunal bill that had been passed
by the National Assembly. In August he condemned mounting political violence
against commune candidates and urged the government to cease its involvement in
election-related opinion surveys.He constantly pressed the government to formalize
its memorandum of understanding with COHCHR so as to extend its mandate,
last renewed in March 2000, and to address the security concerns of COHCHR’s
Cambodian staff.
Relations between the government and the UNHCR were strained at times,
particularly over the issue of refoulement of Montagnard asylum seekers to
Vietnam.
Major Donors
Donors pledged U.S. $560 million at the World Bank chaired Consultative
Group meeting, hosted by Japan in June.Most donors praised the Cambodian government’s
efforts to improve political stability and the economy, although some
raised human rights concerns as well. A study on key governance issues prepared
for the Asian Development Bank, released in May, criticized corruption, lack of
government transparency and weaknesses in the judiciary, and called for concrete
reforms as a precondition for assistance. In August, the World Bank approved a U.S.
$18.4 million loan to demobilize 30,000 soldiers and reintegrate them to civilian
life.
China increasingly became a key player in Cambodia. In May, visiting Chinese
Prime Minister Li Peng told Hun Sen that China would consider aid requests totaling
U.S. $60 million to assist road construction and demobilization.
Several donors, including Japan,Australia, and the European Union (E.U.),were
expected to help meet the costs of the commune elections. In July, an E.U. delegation
called for an intimidation-free environment before and during the election. In
a meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Sarkheng in September, the U.S., U.K., Canadian, Swedish and other ambassadors expressed concern over the low rate of
voter registration and pressed for extension of the registration period. On September
6, the European Parliament passed a resolution deploring political violence and
calling for E.U. observers to monitor the commune elections.
A number of donor countries expressed interest in funding the Khmer Rouge
Tribunal or nominating judges to participate in the proceedings once a final agreement
is reached. Japan was expected to contribute an estimated U.S. $60 million.
Judges from Australia, France, India, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the
United States were considered candidates to preside over the trials, along with
Cambodia judges.China,which was one of the Khmer rouge’s main financial backers,
was not expected to participate.
The U.S. took a strong stand on the Montagnard refugee issue, swiftly resettling
thirty-eight Montagnards in the U.S. in April and consistently pressing for protection
of asylum seekers by both UNHCR and Cambodian authorities. In August, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a strongly worded response after the U.S. ambassador
criticized government corruption at a public forum, charging that “inflammatory
words inciting revolt against the royal government of Cambodia” had been
used.
Cambodia’s relations with Vietnam were tense at times over the Montagnard
issue. During a visit to Cambodia in July, Vietnamese Public Security Minister Le
Minh Huong signed a bilateral agreement with Deputy Prime Minister Sar Kheng
on cooperation to stem illegal immigration, drug smuggling and organized crime.
In November, Vietnamese and Cambodian officials were slated to sign several
agreements, including one on border and immigration issues, during a visit to
Phnom Penh by Vietnamese President Tan Duc Luong.
