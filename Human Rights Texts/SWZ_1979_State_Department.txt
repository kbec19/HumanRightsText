 SWAZILAND
 The Kingdom of Swaziland, a former British high commission
 territory, became independent in 1968 with a constitution
 that provided for a popularly elected Parliament and for
 the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of the
 individual. However, King Sobhuza II decreed its repeal
 in 1973 and assumed supreme power, Governmental decisions
 thereafter being made by the King-in-Council. The council
 comprised cabinet members appointed by the King.
 Parliament was reopened in January 1979, with some members
 chosen through indirect election and others nominated by
 the King. Reestablishment of the Parliament is the first
 step toward a return to constitutional rule.
 King Sobhuza continues to be vested with the country's
 executive authority. He rules through a cabinet appointed
 by him and he retains the right to withhold assent to
 bills passed by the Parliament.
 The Judiciary is independent. Despite the absence of a
 constitution or other written legal safeguards, there has
 been no systematic disregard by the Government for the
 rights of the person.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.    Torture
 The constitution contained a prohibition against torture
 and inhuman and degrading punishment. Although not
 formally reintroduced into law, this prohibition remains
 in practice and there have been no allegations that
 torture is countenanced.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There is no evidence that persons in Swaziland, including
 political detainees, have been subjected to cruel, inhuman,
 or degrading treatment or punishment. The country's main
 prison includes facilities for teaching manual trades.
 The health care and diet in the prisons are approximately
 the same as those available to the general population.
 Persons are allowed visits from family members and from
 attorneys of their choice.
 c.    Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Under a 1938 law, persons can be arrested and held without
 charge for a "reasonable" period. Approximately 15 persons
 are currently jailed for political reasons under a 1978
 law that permits the Government to detain any individual
 for renewable periods of 60 days without being charged.
 Although the law provides that the fact of such detention
 shall be made public, no instance of detention under that
 law has been officially acknowledged. Habeas corpus
 exists except for political detainees, whose detention is
 not subject to appeal to the courts, although it may be
 appealed directly to the King. Persons are held clandes-
 tinely in rare instances in which they are believed to be
 
 
 201
 witnesses in a case under police investigation.
 d.    Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Except for political prisoners, the right to a fair public
 trial is provided for by law and is honored in practice.
 In "national" (traditional) courts, legal counsel is not
 allowed. However, in magistrates' courts, which operate
 under Roman-Dutch law, a defendant is entitled to counsel
 at his own expense. The crown will provide a defense
 counsel in capital cases. Counsel has free access to
 defendants within the limits of prison regulations.
 Harassment of defense counsel by the Government does not
 occur. However, it has been suggested that the reason for
 the detention of one of the present political detainees is
 that, while serving as a lawyer for Pan African Congress
 members who were sentenced in Swaziland for unlawful
 possession of arms and ammunition, he put up a defense
 that was calculated to embarrass the government in its
 relations with other states. Except for political prisoners,
 defendants are made fully aware of the charges against
 them. They and their lawyers are generally able to inform
 themselves of the evidence on which the charges are based.
 The courts are entirely independent of executive or
 military control. There are no special courts to deal
 with security or political offences. Civilians are not
 tried by military courts, and there have been no summary
 executions.
 e.    Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home is safeguarded by custom and
 is honored in practice. Swaziland law requires a warrant
 for the search of a home, or other premises, except when
 thd purpose of the search would be defeated by delay in
 obtaining the warrant. Allegations that Government
 officers have illegally entered into homes are very
 infrequent; none came to public attention in 1979.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Swaziland has a free-enterprise economy characterized
 by a division between the modern sector, which produces
 the vast majority of the country's wealth, and the tradi-
 tional sector which comprises over 70 percent of the
 population. People engaged in traditional agriculture
 have an average annual per capita income of $150 compared
 to an average annual level of $550 for the country as a
 whole. The effects of this disparity in income distribu-
 tion are mitigated by the fact that approximately 80
 percent of all rural households have at least one member
 employed in the modern sector.
 The tax system is progressive, with the burden falling
 primarily on the small modern sector; there is no sales
 tax and the traditional subsistence sector is largely
 untaxed.
 About 60 percent of the land is held in trust by the King
 for the Swazi nation; this land is occupied largely by
 traditional farmers. The other 40 percent of the land is
 privately owned. The right to own property is guaranteed
 by law.

 Swaziland's deve-lopment strategy has until now emphasized
 industrialization and has thus contributed to the divided
 nature of the economy. The Government has recently
 expanded the coverage of the rural development areas
 program, which is designed to increase food production and
 to raise income levels among the country's traditional
 farmers. More importantly, the 1979/80 budget anticipates
 that a much larger share of total resources will be
 allocated to ministries concerned with basic human needs
 than was allocated to them in the previous year's budget.
 The Government's housing policies have tended to stress
 quality over quantity, leaving large unmet shelter needs
 in both rural and urban areas. Health care is provided
 through a system of Government hospitals and clinics and
 by adequate medical installations operated by private
 companies and religious missions. Dramatic increases in
 school enrollment have occurred since independence, with
 the Government seeking to attain its goal of universal
 primary education by 1985. Although standards are low,
 schools have been opened nationwide. The national literacy
 rate is estimated at 29 percent.
 Corruption, which the Government has attacked quietly,
 has not hindered programs for the fulfillment of basic
 human needs.
 3.    Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.    Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Freedom of speech is not guaranteed by law. Comment
 critical of the Government is permitted in the Parliament
 and in traditional Swazi councils; there is no organized
 opposition to the Government.. The Government proscribes
 publications it deems to be prejudicial to the interests
 of defense, public safety and order, public morality, and
 public health. In practice, except for material that is
 judged to be obscene or Communist-oriented, the local and
 international press circulate freely in Swaziland.
 Although there is no law on the subject, Swaziland is
 traditionally hospitable to all religious beliefs; no
 religious group has been persecuted or harassed. The
 King's proclamation of April 12, 1973, provides that no
 meetings of a political nature and no processions or
 demonstrations shall be held in any public place except
 with the written consent, not always granted, of the
 Commissioner of Police. Writers and journalists were
 denied permission in 1979 to meet to discuss the formation
 of a social association. The Swaziland National Association
 of Teachers remains dissolved following a government
 determination in 1977 that it was engaging in political
 activity.
 b.    Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of travel within the country is quaranteed by
 custom and is respected in practice. Movement outside
 southern Africa, whether for travel or emigration, requires
 a passport, which the Government denies if it deems the
 applicant's proposed travel to be prejudicial to its
 interests or if the applicant has no apparent means of
 support for the proposed period of absence from Swaziland.
 
 
 203
 Passport fees are not excessive. The right of return is
 granted to all Swazi passport holders but is almost
 universally denied to refugees who leave Swaziland on
 United Nations travel documents.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Swaziland is an authoritarian no-party state. Political
 parties are outlawed. All citizens may vote in the indirect
 elections for members of Parliament and may participate in
 meetings of their respective Tinkhundla (geographically-
 based councils). Women are not legally equal to men and
 experience economic discrimination. Cultural factors tend
 to inhibit women from playing a larger role in the modern
 sectors of society. A small and slowly growing number of
 women are participating in social, economic, and political
 life outside the traditional fields of teaching, nursing,
 and clerical work.
 4.    Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 As in past years, the Government of Swaziland did not
 respond substantively in 1979 to inquiries of representa-
 tives of Amnesty International groups concerning the
 welfare and whereabouts of individual political detainees.
 No other person or team is known to have sought the
 Government's permission in 1979 to undertake an investiga-
 tion of alleged violations of human rights.
