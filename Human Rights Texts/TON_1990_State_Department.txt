 TONGA
 The Kingdom of Tonga comprises 169 islands scattered over an
 area of 360,000 square kilometers of the South Pacific. All
 but a handful of the approximately 108,000 inhabitants are
 Polynesian. Tonga is a constitutional monarchy, in which
 political life is dominated by the King, the nobility, and a
 few prominent commoners. In 1900 it became a protectorate-of
 Great Britain. In 1970 it became fully independent again and
 a member of the Commonwealth of Nations.
 The security apparatus is composed of the Tonga Defense
 Services (TDS) and a police force. The 300-man TDS force is
 comprised of a Royal Guard platoon, a light infantry company
 (marines), and a naval patrol boat unit. The force is
 responsive to and controlled by the Minister of Defense. The
 Commissioner of Police supervises a police force of some 300
 men.
 Tonga's economy is based almost exclusively on the cultivation
 of tropical and semitropical crops. An increasing demand for
 imported manufactured goods and products unavailable locally
 has led to a substantial trade deficit. This has largely been
 offset by remittances from Tongans employed abroad, overseas
 aid, and, to a lesser degree, tourism.
 Tonga adopted its first and current Constitution in 1875. In
 recent years, however, this charter has come under increasing
 challenge from commoners in Tonga who are disadvantaged by
 it. In 1990 there were renewed calls for constitutional
 reform to make the original 1875 document more democratic.
 The past year also saw the the beginnings of movement toward a
 more independent judiciary. Meanwhile, an emergent
 independent press has continued to grow. The principal areas
 of human rights concerns are restrictions on the right of
 citizens to change their government and discrimination against
 women.

 e.- Denal of-Fair Public Trial
 In 1990 Tonga took a significant step in reorganizing its
 judiciary systprm by creating the Court of Appeal. This court
 i6 both separate.from the political system and, as the new
 appellate c6urt of last resort, the highest court in the
 land. Previously, this role was played by the King's Privy
 Council Court of Appeal.. The.latter now presides only over
 &ases relating to disputes over titles of nobility and estate
 boundaries. The King, however, still retain  the right to
 commute a death sentence in cases of murder or treason. In
 addiiion,*Tonga's court system consists of the Supreme Court
 (which has original jurisdiction over all major cases), the
 Police Magistrate's Courts, a General Court, a Court Martial
 foi the Tongan Defense Services, a Court Tribunal for the
 police force, and a Court of Review for the Inland Revenue
 Department.
 The right to a faii public trial is provided for by law and
 honored in practice. No one may be summoned before any court
 without first having received a written indictment clearly
 stating the offense with which that person is charged.
 Defendants are'entitled ,to counsel, and lawyers have free
 access-to defendants. There are no political prisoners.
 'f." Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 By l'aw'no one may enter or' search the home of another, or
 remove any item of property unless in possession of a warrant
 issued by a magistrate. There is no arbitrary intrusion by
 the State or polit cal organizations intoa person's private
 lire.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and- press is provided for in the
 Constitution. The one radio station and the newspaper with
 the Iargest circulation are government owned. Other
 components of the media are privately owned. In 1985 the most
 prominent People's Representative in the Legislative Assembly,
 Akilisa Pohiva, lost his-job as a senior education officer for
 using his fortnightly radio program to criticize the
 distribution of wealth in Tonga. -In 1988 the courts
 reinstated him and awarded him-damages- for wrongful
 dismissal. He has since created his own newspaper Ke-le'a. (The
 Conch), which openly criticizes-the Government. The
 Government has not interfered with it. The Catholic monthly
 Taumu'a Lelei also speaks out freely. The Minister of Police
 has inveighed and threatened action against the independent
 media in one or- two cases, but no action has ever been taken.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Peaceful assembly and association are provided for by
 law. There are no significant restrictions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution and
 observed in practice. Missionaries may prdselytize without

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Tongan citizens are free to travel anywhere within the Kingdom
 and abroad. There are no restrictions on repatriation. There
 are no displaced persons in Tonga.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the ability to change their leaders or
 the system of government. The King and a small group of
 hereditary nobles dominate political life in Tonga. They
 assert authority largely through their control of substantial
 landholdings. The Constitution allows the monarch broad
 powers, many of which do not require the endorsement of the
 legislative branch. The King appoints and presides over the
 Privy Council, which makes major policy decisions. (When the
 King is not presiding, the Privy Council is called the
 Cabinet). The King also selects the Prime Minister and other
 cabinet ministers, who hold office at his pleasure. Tonga's
 unicameral legislature, the Legislative Assembly, consists of
 12 cabinet ministers, 9 nobles elected by their peers (33
 noble titles are recognized by the Constitution), and 9
 People's Representatives elected by all literate, tax-paying
 males and all literate females. Those above 21 years of age
 are eligible to vote. The King appoints a speaker from-among
 the Nobles' Representatives. Government ministers and Nobles'
 Representatives generally vote as a bloc. People's
 Representatives sometimes vote against the Government.
 Elections are held every 3 years. There are no political
 parties. In 1989 frustration over their minority status in
 the House led six People's Representatives to walk out of that
 body. In 1990 certain members of the-government establishment
 echoed their call for more democratic change. Lands Minister
 Ma'afu Tupou is one of these. Concern has been expressed that
 change be progressive and peaceful.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no local nongovernmental organizations that concern
 themselves with human rights. There have been no requests for
 human rights violations investigations by outside human rights
 organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Social, cultural, and economic facilities are available to all
 citizens regardless of race, religion, or sex. However,
 members of the hereditary nobility have substantial advantages
 in Tongan society. These include control over most of the
 land and a generally privileged status. Nonetheless, it is
 possible for commoners to rise to cabinet positions in
 government and to accumulate great wealth and status in the
 private sector.
 Tongan society is male dominated, and women generally occupy a
 subordinate role. While the strong Polynesian cultural
 tradition has not encouraged the rise of women to positions of
 leadership, some have become members of the legislature and
 served in responsible positions in skilled and semiskilled
 occupations.

 Little information is available on the incidence of domestic
 violence in Tonga. The authorities generally do not take an
 active role in such cases. -Wifq'beating is generally dealt
 with-, intraditional ways between the'families and village
 chiet;'4bised,wives-sometimes return to their families if
 mediation fails:-
 Section:ï¿½6 Worker Rights '              .
 a.' The Right 6f Association
 Wof ers have the right to form'unions inder the trade union
 act passed in 1964, but 'to date no iinions have been formed.
 Tohga'Is norta mdmber of the International Labor Organiz.tion.
 b.-The Right to Organize and Bargain Corllectively
 Since no .unions have been formed in Tonga, collective
 bargaining is not a widespread practice, but 'a kind of
 collective bargaining does occur informally. Labor laws and
 regulations are uniformly-enforced in all sectors of the
 economy, including in export enhancemqnt zones.
 c.- c  Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced'laboi -is prohibited by law and not practiced.
 d. Minimumi Age for Employment of Childrn
 Child labor legislation has been pending since 1986. In
 practice, child labor is not used in Tonga.
 e. Acceptabl' Conditions of Work
 By regulation the workweek in Tonga is limited to 40 hours.
 Labor laws and regulations are enforced by the Ministry of
 Labor, d6mmeice, and Industry. A panel chaired by the
 Minister is empowered to set minimum wage guidelines but has
 not done so. Although Tonga still does not have a minimum-
 wage law, it has for some years set minimum daily wages for
 such sectors of the economy as manufacturing and tourism.
 Workers are protected to a degree by the ease with which they
 can return to their villages and live without a cash income if
 wages offered are inadequate. Worker rights legislation
 covering such matters as safety stindards, conditions of
 employment, and child labor is still pending in the
 Legislative Assembly. Industrial 'accidents are rare as few
 industries exist that would expose workers to significant
 danger. Legislation for the provision of social security
 benefits to the work forcehas been under consideration by the
 Government since 1983.
