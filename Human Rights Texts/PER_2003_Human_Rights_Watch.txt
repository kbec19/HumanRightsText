PERU
While Peruvians had high hopes that the government of President Alejandro
Toledo would make a decisive break with the authoritarian policies
of his predecessors, his administration lacked a clear vision of human rights and
often seemed to be improvising in the face of conflicting pressures. The truth commission
established by caretaker president Valentín Paniagua in 2001 and supported
by Toledo enjoyed credibility and wide public support, despite political
attacks and budgetary problems.However, the quest for truth was not matched by
comparable progress in the quest for justice, with prosecutors making little headway
on key rights cases.
Important reforms were instituted in the national police force, but torture
remained endemic. Prison conditions did not improve, and in some cases sharply
deteriorated. Belated government proposals to reform the draconian anti-terrorism laws bequeathed by the Fujimori government did not address many due
process concerns and added some new ones. In tackling these legacies, President
Toledo faced considerable obstacles: a resurgence of activity by armed groups; a
stagnant economy; popular unrest as living standards failed to improve; and a fractious
opposition often critical of efforts to examine the past.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
A car bomb explosion in a shopping center fifty meters from the U.S. embassy in
Lima on March 20, the eve of a state visit to Lima by President George W. Bush,
abruptly brought the issue of terrorism to the fore.The blast killed nine people and
wounded at least thirty others. In June, the government announced that it had
arrested and charged three alleged members of the Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso,
S.L.) guerrilla group in connection with the attack. This and other incidents
attributed to Shining Path brought renewed calls from politicians for tougher antiterrorism
measures. These security concerns complicated long overdue efforts to
reform anti-terrorist legislation, which had been repeatedly criticized by the Inter-
American Commission on Human Rights for violating due process guarantees.
In mid-June, the government imposed a thirty-day state of emergency in the
southern city of Arequipa, to quell violent protests and looting. The protests began
with a hunger strike by eight mayors protesting government proposals to privatize
two electricity companies, allegedly in breach of a campaign promise. Two young
people died and 150 people were injured during the six-day riots,which threatened
to engulf Tacna,Cusco, and other cities. The protests subsided when Toledo promised
to suspend the sale of the companies.
Between April and September, Peru’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission
held televised hearings in rural towns across the country,devoted to the testimonies
of victims of “disappearances,” extrajudicial executions, torture, rape, and massacres
that took place from 1980 to 2000.The hearings were unprecedented in Latin
America; all previous truth commissions had met behind closed doors.After years
of official silence, the hearings brought home with tremendous emotional force the
suffering caused by Peru’s twenty-year counterinsurgency effort.
The commission also participated in the exhumation of clandestine graves in
Ayacucho province, permitting the identification of remains. In January, the
remains of eight peasants were discovered in a grave in the district of Chuschi, identified,
and returned to their relatives for burial. In August, bones belonging to nine
victims were found in two graves in Totos, Cangallo province; five were positively
identified. Both the Chuschi and Totos victims were believed to have been summarily
executed in 1983 by government troops led by a captain with the nom-deguerre
of “Jackal” (“Chacal”). In response to the clamor of victims’ relatives for
justice, the commission set up a unit to refer egregious cases to the courts immediately
rather than waiting until it completed its work in July 2003.
The impartiality of the commission was repeatedly questioned by politicians
belonging to the Popular American Revolutionary Alliance (Alianza Popular Revolucionaria
Americana, APRA). APRA leader Alan García was president of the country from 1985-1990, a period during which many of the most serious human
rights violations took place.Although the government supported the commission,
it was slow to make up its 60 percent share of the commission’s budget; the remaining
40 percent was funded by other countries. In August, Salomón Lerner, the commission’s
chair, warned publicly that the commission would have to stop work
within a week if U.S.$3.3 million promised for 2002 was not received.Managers of
a special fund administering monies recovered from corruption agreed to meet the
sum and released U.S.$1.5 million to tide the commission over.
Trials of officials implicated in human rights violations during Alberto Fujimori’s
rule continued, but progress was modest. On July 1, anti-corruption judge
Saúl Peña Farfán sentenced Vladimiro Montesinos, Fujimori’s close political advisor,
to nine years and four months of incarceration for usurping the functions of
the head of the National Intelligence Service (Servicio de Inteligencia Nacional,
SIN).Montesinos, held at the naval base of Collao, faced criminal charges in seventy-
five other cases.Along with Fujimori, he was charged with organizing the Colina
Group, a death squad responsible for extrajudicial executions, torture, and
“disappearances” in the early 1990s. In October, prosecutor Richard Saavedra filed
charges against forty-four members of the group for the abduction and murder of
journalist PedroYauri Bustamante on June 24, 1992.
Cabinet ministers and prominent members of Congress tried to prevent the
prosecution of army commandos who had participated in an operation to free seventy-
one people held hostage by guerrillas in the Japanese ambassador’s residence
in 1997. Fourteen members of the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement
(Movimiento Revolucionario Túpac Amaru,MRTA) were killed in the operation.
Some of the freed hostages reported having seen several of the guerrillas alive
and in custody before they were killed. Forensic examinations carried out on the
exhumed bodies established that eight of the guerrillas were apparently shot in the
head after capture, or while defenseless because of injuries. On May 13, Judge
Cecilia Pollack ordered the arrest of twelve senior army officers who participated in
the raid. The ministers of defense and justice criticized the arrest warrants. Congress
issued a statement of concern, and APRA and National Unity (Unidad
Nacional,U.N.) legislators presented bills to award the accused an amnesty. On July
29, in a clear demonstration of official support, the implicated commandos led
Peru’s traditional annual military parade.
Although the amnesty initiative did not succeed, a military judge initiated parallel
proceedings in a military tribunal, challenging the jurisdiction of the civilian
court.On August 16, a Supreme Court panel ruled unanimously in favor of the military
tribunal, on the ground that the operation took place in a district of Lima
under a state of emergency at the time. It also ruled that the civilian court should
retain jurisdiction over four of the accused, including Montesinos and then army
commander-in-chief Gen.Nicolás de Bari Hermoza, whom the court claimed had
acted outside the chain of command. In addition to awarding the case to a tribunal
lacking independence and impartiality, the decision effectively prejudged one of
the key issues of the trial: who had given the orders and on what authority.
In April, the attorney general appointed Felipe Villavicencio Terreros as Special
Prosecutor on Forced Disappearances, Extrajudicial Executions and the Exhumation of Clandestine Graves. The post was created under a friendly agreement
between the government and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights
reached in January 2001, by which the state accepted responsibility for 159 cases of
“disappearances,” mainly dating from the 1980s, and undertook to continue judicial
investigations to clarify the fate of the 250 victims and bring the perpetrators to
justice. The special prosecutor was also mandated to exhume and identify human
remains. (There were believed to be more than five hundred clandestine burial sites
across the country.) Unfortunately, the new office was seriously under-resourced.
Dr.Villavicencio had two assistant prosecutors,but lacked full-time assistance from
prosecutors at the local level, as well as a budget for a database.
There was little progress in the government’s attempts to have Alberto Fujimori
extradited from Japan to stand trial for corruption and human rights violations. In
June, the cabinet approved a Supreme Court judge’s request for the extradition
materials to be filed. In early November, the bulky file was still be being translated
into Japanese.Fujimori’s spokesman announced in July that he was planning to run
for president again in the 2006 elections.
On July 26, President Toledo introduced a bill to reform Peru’s draconian antiterrorist
laws, a legacy of the Fujimori government.The government hoped to allay
international criticism by removing the laws’ due process shortcomings, while
making the laws more severe and ensuring that those convicted under the existing
laws could not find procedural reasons to justify their release. In fact, the reform
proposals created additional due process concerns: for example, those arrested for
a second terrorist offense committed after serving their sentence for the first one
could be interned as a “security measure” for up to thirty years, contravening the
presumption of innocence, and detainees held on terrorism charges could be kept
in custody for up to six years without a finding of guilt, if the investigation met with
“special difficulty.”
Torture remained a serious problem. The Human Rights Commission (Comisión
de Derechos Humanos, COMISEDH), a respected nongovernmental human
rights group, documented fifty-three cases involving seventy-seven victims from
January 2001 through August 2002. Fifteen of the victims died as a result of torture.
A law introduced in 1998 explicitly outlawing torture made little impact on the prevailing
impunity for this serious crime: In the four years since its promulgation
there were only three convictions. Many prosecutors failed to file complaints, or
filed them for the lesser crime of “abuse of authority.” In other cases, military prosecutors
assumed jurisdiction under military laws that classified torture as a specific
military offense. Often they investigated the crime in parallel with civilian courts,
refused to cooperate with them, or formally disputed their jurisdiction.
Of particular concern in 2002 were reports of the torture of military recruits. By
September, COMISEDH had documented nine such cases. On July 9, Rolando
Quispe Berrocal, a nineteen-year-old recruit at the Domingo Ayarza army base in
Huamanga, was woken in the night by three sergeants who allegedly doped him
with an impregnated cloth and forced into his anus a talcum powder container into
which a light bulb had been inserted. After he had been hospitalized and operated
on for his injuries, army officials mounted guard around Quispe and threatened
both him and members of his family. On July 24, the Ayacucho military prosecutor charged him with lying, maintaining that he was a homosexual and had inflicted
his injuries himself.He was sentenced the following month to thirty days detention
and payment of damages of 1,500 soles (approx.U.S.$416).At the same time, a military
court opened an investigation for “abuse of authority” against those responsible
for his torture.
Despite welcome improvements in the rules covering those convicted or held on
terrorism charges, the prison infrastructure remained woefully deficient, and overcrowding
was severe. Lima’s Lurigancho prison, for example, designed for 1,800
prisoners, housed around seven thousand. Prisoners slept huddled in rows on the
floor of large pavilions. Prisoners with tuberculosis or HIV/AIDS (2.6 percent of
inmates in 1999, most at an advanced stage of the disease) were treated by volunteers
from Doctors Without Borders (Médicins Sans Frontiers); the state provided
none. The population of the remote Challapalca high security prison in Puno,
located at fourteen thousand feet in the Andes, doubled from fifty to more than one
hundred in 2002. Due to its oxygen-thin air, isolation, and freezing temperatures,
Peru’s human rights ombudsman and the Inter-American Commission on Human
Rights had repeatedly called for the prison’s closure as a health hazard both to
inmates and staff.
In August, the government promulgated an access to information law, aimed at
promoting transparency in government.The law established that all information in
the hands of the state was, in principle, public, and fixed penalties for refusal of
access. The Peruvian Press Council described the law as a “step in the right direction,”
but said that it had been approved in a hurry and without enough debate. In
particular, it criticized a provision that allowed the cabinet to classify information
as secret on overly broad national security grounds.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Edwar Alvarez, a lawyer working for the respected human rights group, the
Institute of Legal Defense (Instituto de Defensa Legal, IDL), received death threats
from José Eduardo Tomanguilla, a police lieutenant who had just been sentenced
to ten years imprisonment for the torture and “disappearance” of Alejandro Trujillo
in March 2000. Shortly afterwards Tomanguilla escaped from custody, raising
concern for Alvarez’s safety.
As of this writing, the Peruvian Congress had yet to appoint a successor to Dr.
Jorge Santistevan as human rights ombudsman.The ombudsman’s office had been
without a titular head since December 2000, and had been headed provisionally by
Santistevan’s deputy, Walter Albán. The ombudsman’s office continued to command
credibility and wide popular support in Peru for its vigor and independence
in defending human rights. In May,Human Rights Watch wrote to the president of
Congress, Carlos Ferrero Costa, urging that a competent appointee be named
quickly.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
At the April session of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, in a welcome
development, Peru issued a standing invitation for visits of U.N. human rights
monitoring mechanisms, putting it among only five countries in the Americas that
had done so.
In August, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women
congratulated Peru on “great progress” in enacting legislation to combat discrimination
against women. Several experts, however, noted that the electoral quota system
for women had been disregarded in some parts of the country in the April 2001
elections.
Organization of American States
In April, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) issued its
conclusions in the case of U.S. citizen Lori Berenson, convicted of terrorism in June
2001 after a trial in a civilian court. The commission found that the trial violated
the principle of legality, as well as Berenson’s due process rights. The commission’s
observations centered on the 1992 anti-terrorism law on which the new trial was
based. It also criticized the use of evidence obtained during her first trial by a military
court. The commission called on Peru to redress the violations of Berenson’s
rights and reform the terrorism laws.
During a visit to Peru in August, Marta Altolaguirre, a commission member,
announced that Minister of Justice Fausto Alvarado Dodero had promised to
implement the IACHR’s recommendation to close down Challapalca prison.
In October, the commission admitted for review a case presented by the human
rights ombudsman’s office and a women’s rights group alleging that in three electoral
districts the electoral authorities had failed to respect the 30 percent quota for
women candidates.
United States
On January 7, the State Department released a group of thirty-eight declassified
documents in response to a request from a Peruvian congressional committee
investigating charges of corruption and human rights violations against Vladimiro
Montesinos. Forty-one other documents obtained under the Freedom of Information
Act by the National Security Archive, a Washington-based group, were published
the same month. Both sets of documents provided valuable information for
on-going court investigations into human rights violations in Peru. In September,
during a visit by Toledo to Washington, the State Department announced that
another fifty-four declassified documents would be released shortly.
In July, United States officials reportedly confirmed their intention to resume
joint aerial drug interdiction missions in Peru. Such missions had been suspended
in April 2001 after a missionary, Veronica Bowers, and her infant daughter were killed when their plane was mistaken for a drug-trafficker’s aircraft and shot down
by a Peruvian fighter jet.
According to a press statement issued by the Association of Baptists for World
Evangelism (ABWE) in March,“after being warned nothing would be done for our
missionaries unless we agreed to release the U.S. government from responsibility
for any payment for losses to our organization, ABWE has chosen to grant a
release.”Human Rights Watch learned that the United States was considering giving
Peruvian pilots sole decision-making responsibility when the program was
resumed, making it easier for the United States to deny responsibility for future
mistakes resulting in death or serious injury. In August,Human Rights Watch wrote
to President Toledo urging him to reject any such program if it entailed the unlawful
use of lethal force against civilians, whether drug-traffickers or not.
