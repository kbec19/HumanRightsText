SUDAN
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
The Sudan government and the rebel Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/
Army (SPLM/A) made great strides in 2002, on paper, toward respect for human
rights and settlement of the nineteen-year civil war. The war, however, heated up
as the parties fought over oilfields and key garrisons; it was not brought to a halt
until the parties agreed on October 15 to a standstill during peace negotiations.On
October 30, Talisman Energy Inc., the Canadian oil company leading the development
of the only concession producing oil for export in Sudan, announced that it
would sell off its Sudan assets, thus bringing to a successful close a major campaign
against the company by nongovernmental organizations in Canada, the United
States (U.S.), and Europe.
The first agreements between the warring parties took place between January
and March—these were four agreements proposed by U.S. Special Presidential
Envoy for Peace in Sudan John Danforth. On July 20 the parties signed initial peace
protocols in Machakos, Kenya, agreeing to a referendum in which the south would
be able to chose between unity or independence, following a six-month pre-interim
and six-year interim period after the signing of a final peace agreement.
The four Danforth agreements were: (1) an internationally monitored cease-fire
in the Nuba Mountains for humanitarian access purposes; (2) “zones of tranquility”
for polio, rinderpest, and guinea worm health programs; (3) an international
commission to investigate slavery; and (4) an internationally monitored end to
attacks on civilians and civilian objects.
The Nuba Mountains agreement, concluded first and signed in Switzerland on
January 19, resulted in a six-month cease-fire in the Nuba Mountains, extended in
July, allowing food drops to neglected areas and permitting free access by civilians
to all areas of the Nuba Mountains—access that, however, the government did not provide. This and other human rights aspects of the cease-fire agreement did not
receive sufficient attention from the Joint Verification Mission, composed under
the agreement of military personnel seconded by various European countries and
the U.S. under Norwegian leadership—and chronically understaffed and underfunded.
The government army strikingly lacked captured combatants, leading to a conclusion
it had a forbidden “take no prisoners” order. The government continued to
deny access by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to anyone
detained in connection with the conflict, despite an explicit provision in the Nuba
Mountains agreement for ICRC access to those persons.
More positively, a series of new mine action projects were initiated in the Nuba
Mountains,with a number of assessments on both sides. The U.S. deployed part of
its quick reaction demining force to conduct an assessment on both sides. Operation
Save Innocent Lives, a southern Sudanese NGO, cleared a total of 526 kilometers
of road and 263,093 square meters of land between April 2001 and March 2002.
Both the government and the SPLM/A renewed pledges not to use antipersonnel
mines anywhere in Sudan, although there were still unconfirmed allegations of use
by both sides. Evidence that landmines were used by the Sudanese government
emerged with the death on June 11 of six agricultural aid workers in a project on
the SPLM/A side of the Nuba Mountains, close to government lines. The SPLA
apparently mined a road in the oilfields of Sudan north of Ler, Western Upper
Nile/Unity State, in September, killing four or five road construction workers in a
military convoy.
The Danforth-proposed slavery commission, composed of eminent international
persons and field workers, conducted its research and wrote a well-received
report on slavery and abductions in Sudan issued in May, with many recommendations.
Most had yet to be realized as of this writing. Negotiations on zones of
tranquility were more difficult than envisioned, and enforcement consumed much
diplomatic time.
The Sudan government originally balked at the fourth Danforth agreement, for
no targeted attacks on civilians. On February 20 its helicopter gunships attacked
Bieh, a food distribution site in Western Upper Nile/Unity State oilfield region, and
killed twenty-four civilians, injuring many more. The attack was witnessed by
United Nations (U.N.) food monitors, and condemned worldwide.The Sudan government
later apologized for the “accident,”and in March it and the SPLM/A signed
the agreement not to attack civilians or civilian objects.
In June-July, the U.S., United Kingdom, and Norway took a role as lead mediators
at the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD, a regional organization
comprising Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, and
Uganda) peace talks between the Sudanese government and the SPLM/A, hosted
and led by the Kenyan government. The protocol signed at Machakos on July 20
referred in the preamble to human rights and the parties’ desire to establish a
“framework for governance through which human rights would be guaranteed,”
and stated their desire to find “a comprehensive solution that respected the fundamental
human and political rights of all Sudanese peoples, including agreement to
establish a democratic system of governance.”
Meanwhile, the government of Sudan built several arms plants to become selfsufficient in weapons and ammunition. In August 2002 Russia confirmed the
export to Sudan in 2001 of twenty-two armored combat vehicles and twelve attack
helicopters. Under a defense cooperation agreement with Russia, first discussed in
December 2001, Sudan negotiated to buy some twelve MiG-29 fighter planes said
to be worth U.S.$120 million.The contract was to be finalized in May 2002, according
to media reports citing Russian defense industry sources. In September 2002,
the U.S. government imposed sanctions on three state-owned Russian companies
(though not the Russian government) for arms supplies to Sudan, which was still
on the U.S. list of countries it considered sponsors of terrorism. A Bulgarian company
lost its arms trading license in May 2002 pending a criminal investigation into
alleged illegal arms transfers (reportedly dismantled tanks) to the Sudanese government.
The company maintained its innocence, saying it was making final deliveries
under a mid-1990s contract to help build an arms factory. Bulgarian officials
acknowledged such a contract had been approved, but said new shipments to
Sudan had not been authorized.
In December 2001, the National Assembly, dominated by the ruling (Islamist)
National Congress (N.C.), approved the extension for another year of the state of
emergency in effect since December 1999. It amended the constitution in May
2002, granting President Omar El Bashir greater executive powers and allowing for
his indefinite rule, and additional powers to the security forces and police.
Repression of opposition political activity remained the norm. The opposition
Popular National Congress (PNC)—founded by President Bashir’s erstwhile
Islamist ally, Dr. Hassan Turabi—suffered a series of arrests and rearrests; by September
some 150 activists throughout the country were in detention. Dr. Turabi
continued in prolonged arbitrary detention, mandated by presidential decree, contrary
to a court decision in October 2000 ordering his release. One wing of the
Umma Party joined the government in 2002, but the main faction under Sadiq al
Mahdi remained outside the government and its followers continued to suffer
arrests; in late May security forces arrested at least twenty-five student Umma
members for attempting to form a students’ union.
Moderate students’ protests at mass arrests and security and police attacks
against them during October demonstrations led to Islamist student militia attacks
against them, injuring many, and subsequent torture after the hospitalized were
taken to security detention. Five of the University of Khartoum’s twelve faculties
remained closed as of this writing.
The press was faced with intermittent increased repression: journalists and editors
were detained and questioned about the publications’ content; newspapers
were fined heavily; and editions of many papers were confiscated because of articles
the censors did not like, although all papers were subjected to prior censorship.
While outside support arrived for the English-language Khartoum Monitor, there
was less support for equally harassed colleagues in the Arabic-language press. Al
Ayam was punished by one day’s closure for an article discussing the health hazards
of female genital cutting, although official government policy opposes the practice.
Another instrument of repression were “emergency tribunals” established
under the 1998 State of Emergency Act.These courts, composed of one civilian and
two military judges, handed down stringent sentences summarily, without any respect for the right to a fair trial. By July 1, 2002, at least nineteen people had been
executed in the Darfur region after sentencing by these tribunals. The emergency
tribunals summarily sentenced eighty-eight people to death in Darfur, allegedly in
response to lethal raids by the Riziegat Baggara ethnic group on the smaller Ma’alia
tribe.
Other courts also imposed draconian penalties without fair trial, as in the Darfur
region where six men were sentenced to amputations and cross amputations
(one hand and the opposite foot amputated) for crimes such as robbery and the
unlicensed possession of weapons in December 2001. In that month, a court in
Southern Darfur sentenced an eighteen-year-old Dinka woman to death by stoning
under shari’a (Islamic law) for the crime of adultery; she did not have legal representation
or an interpreter. After international protest the sentence was
overturned on appeal, but the trial court imposed forty lashes, administered on the
spot, without counsel or right of appeal.
The war continued to lead to pervasive human rights abuses.The Sudanese government
continued to displace and kill civilian populations, the most active theatre
of war being the oilfield areas of Western Upper Nile/Unity State. There, the government
brought in Islamist militia and Arab Baggara militia troops (muraheleen)
to supplement its regular troops in attacking the civilian population and occasionally
the rebels.
In early 2002 the pro-government Nuer (southern) militia of Gen. Paulino
Matiep joined forces with the muraheleen and conducted scorched earth campaigns
to drive tens of thousands of Nuer residents from their homes. The horsebacked
muraheleen crossed rivers to Nuer areas (inaccessible before the oil
companies built bridges).Women and children in Western Upper Nile/Unity State
were abducted and raped by the muraheleen, this Nuer militia, and government
army forces in early 2002; it was feared that the muraheleen enslaved those
abducted. The World Food Program (WFP) and Operation Lifeline Sudan in
March 2002 conservatively estimated that 174,200 individuals remained displaced
due to the oilfields war.
In January 2002,Cmdr.Riek Machar (who in 1991 led a breakaway faction from
the SPLM/A and in 1997 signed a peace agreement with the government) and the
SPLM/A announced their forces were merging, and a local Nuer commander in
Block 5A switched loyalties to the SPLM/A. The oil consortium operating south of
Bentiu in Block 5A led by Swedish company Lundin then announced its operations
were suspended due to insecurity, and until a negotiated peace was reached.At this
writing, only the consortium led by Talisman continued to produce oil for export,
at 230,000 barrels per day, from one concession. Oil revenue was at least 20 percent
of government income in 2001, and the military budget consumed about 60 percent
of oil revenue in that year.
The muraheleen who with the government army “protected” the rail line from
Babanusa to Wau in Bahr El Ghazal used this role also to carry out several slave raids
in 2002.The government’s Committee for the Eradication of Abduction ofWomen
and Children (CEAWC) continued to exist but failed to alleviate the slavery problem
as local administrations in Baggara areas refused to cooperate in turning over
enslaved persons.
The government relied more heavily in 2002 on its growing air force to bomb
locations throughout the rebel areas and to reinforce garrison towns. Numerous
well-documented incidents of intentional aerial bombing of civilian targets (with
no military significance) occurred during 2001-2002, as in Bieh, above. According
to the church, in June government aircraft bombed the compound of the Roman
Catholic bishop of Torit in Ikotos, Eastern Equatoria, injuring at least four construction
workers. On September 21, the government bombed a cattle camp near
Lui,Bahr El Ghazal, and killed thirteen Dinka cattle herders (four of them children)
and more than fifty cattle.
The government continued to require high school students ages sixteen and
older to serve in the Popular Defense Force (PDF, an Islamist government militia),
often sending them—with inadequate training—as child soldiers to the front lines.
Its militias continued to forcibly recruit southerners residing in Khartoum as well
as those living in the south, among them many underage boys.
The SPLA, which took the garrison town of Kapoeta earlier in 2002, on August
31 captured Torit, 100 kilometers east of the largest southern town, Juba (under
government control since the beginning of the war). Reportedly government casualties,
many by SPLA summary execution of captured or wounded combatants,
were high.
The day after the SPLA took Torit, the government announced that it was withdrawing
from the peace negotiations on the pretext that the SPLA had broken a
non-existent “cease-fire.”The government then bombed Torit and areas untouched
for years, such as the Samaritan’s Purse hospital in Lui, Bahr El Ghazal.
After retaking Torit in October, the government returned to the peace negotiations
and on October 15 it and the SPLM/A reached an agreement on a military
standstill, extended until March 31, 2003. On October 26, the parties agreed with
the U.N. that they would permit full humanitarian access to all parts of Sudan,
through December 31.
The agreement to full humanitarian access was a reprieve from prior government
bans: it had maintained a two-year-plus ban on relief flights in many areas,
including Eastern Equatoria and most of Western Upper Nile/Unity State. The
most draconian ban to date was a September 27-October 6 ban effectively blocking
all humanitarian assistance to the non-government areas of the south.
When instances of rape and other abuses by SPLA soldiers against persons displaced
from Raga,Western Bahr El Ghazal,were reported, the SPLA authorities singled
out those thought responsible and summarily executed several soldiers, on the
basis of summary courts martial not subject to appeal.Reports of summary executions
of captured non-southern enemy soldiers ordered by SPLA Cmdr. Peter Gatdet
circulated, but the SPLA seemingly took no action to rein in this commander.
According to local sources, on March 13, 2002, SPLA forces attacked the village
of Tuhubak, already under SPLA control east of Torit. Some 200 forces burned all
the 173 homes in this village, population 970, and killed at least twenty-five civilians,
mostly elderly, women, and children. North of Abyei, on September 21, an
SPLA pre-dawn attack on the village of Todaj captured some forty-five civilians,
including many children under the age of fifteen, for conscription.The SPLA forces
reportedly tortured and humiliated the chief, and looted the village and all the cattle. The forty-five captives were taken to SPLA territory and held for two weeks,
then released. Human Rights Watch written inquiries to the SPLM/A regarding
these attacks went unanswered.
In a positive move, a settlement was reached in the Eastern Equatoria area
around Chukudum in August between the Didinga and the SPLA army and their
Bor Dinka relatives living as displaced persons in the area. The reconciliation conference,
sponsored by the New Sudan Council of Churches, came after years of lowlevel
warfare with many civilian casualties between the Didinga and SPLA.The area
remained heavily mined (mostly by the SPLA).
The SPLA continued to recruit underage soldiers in or near battlefields,while at
the same time it demobilized thousands of underage soldiers elsewhere. Child soldiers
were still common: Human Rights Watch in August interviewed SPLA soldiers
aged fifteen and sixteen (recruited two years earlier) from small tribes of
Southern Blue Nile.
The SPLM/A permitted ICRC access in five or six locations to its “prisoners of
war,” mostly non-southerners.
The Sudanese government had for years provided bases and other military support
for the abusive Ugandan rebel forces of the Lord’s Resistance Movement
(LRA), in retaliation for the Ugandan government’s backing of the SPLA.After September
11, 2001, the U.S. put the LRA on its list of terrorist organizations, and the
Sudanese government hastened its promised withdrawal of support from the LRA.
The Sudanese government had provided bases for the LRA south of Juba, but after
it began to withdraw its support the LRA began raiding and looting Sudanese villages
for food, and killing Sudanese civilians. The Sudanese government gave the
Ugandan government permission to pursue the LRA inside Sudan, starting in
March 2002. As a result of the campaign, LRA forces returned to Uganda, where
they carried out further abuses. (See Uganda.) The Sudanese government clashed
several times with units of LRA remaining in the Imatong Mountains and elsewhere
in southern Sudan, but did not offer much protection to the thousands the
LRA displaced.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Fledgling human rights organizations and monitors in the capital Khartoum
(the only place in government areas they could exist) continued to be at risk of arbitrary
arrest and harassment. They were subjected to harassment and arrest of their
leaders by security forces; Toby Madut, head of one southern human rights group
in Khartoum, was briefly jailed in 2002.
In SPLA-controlled southern and Nuba areas, small steps were taken in building
a civil administration, funded by foreign governments. Although SPLA relations
with the New Sudan Council of Churches improved in 2001, there was still little
space for the establishment and growth of an independent human rights entity,
albeit several indigenous nongovernmental organizations, including women’s
groups, said they were attempting to play that role informally.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
One effect of the U.S. government “war on terror” was continued engagement
with Sudan, which had already been cooperating since 2000 in some intelligence
and counterterrorism matters.
United Nations
Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Sudan Gerhart Baum delivered a report
critical of the government and the SPLA to the U.N.Commission on Human Rights
in April, noting that the “overall human rights situation remains a matter of concern”
and that the “human rights situation has not yet changed and no tangible
improvement can yet be appreciated.”
The commission passed by one vote the resolution to reauthorize the rapporteur’s
mandate. Baum subsequently expressed cautious optimism about the
Machakos process, but called for a more comprehensive agreement, one that would
incorporate a role for human rights, democracy, and civil society in the ongoing
peace negotiations. The commission resolved that the Sudan government should
consider how to expand the office of the commission’s adviser in Sudan to include
monitoring, but the government did not respond.
When the special rapporteur called on the government in August to provide
transparency in accounting for its oil revenues, the government refused to permit
him to enter Sudan for his regular visit in the latter half of 2002, although through
the intervention of the German government, he was finally invited to visit in
October.
United States
As noted above, the U.S. vigorously supported the IGAD peace negotiations.At
the same time, the Bush administration prolonged to November 2003 existing
extensive U.S. economic sanctions on U.S. citizens and corporations doing business
with Sudan.
The U.S. Congress increased pressure on the Sudanese government in October
2002 with passage of the Sudan Peace Act. The law would impose greater sanctions
on the Sudan government should it walk away from talks or not negotiate in good
faith with the SPLM/A. It separately provided that U.S.$100 million would go to the
areas controlled by the opposition political and military umbrella group National
Democratic Alliance (NDA), of which the SPLA was the largest member.Although
the Danforth-negotiated agreement to halt targeted attacks on civilians and civilian
objects was signed by both parties in March 2002, as of this writing the U.S. State
Department,which undertook to enforce this agreement, had not seen its contractor,
PAE Government Services, Inc., conduct the first investigation.
In September, a New York federal court declined to strike down a lawsuit, commenced
in November 2001, against Talisman for harm to the Sudanese plaintiffs
including displacement and destruction of personal property, on account of Talisman’s
oil activities.
European Union
The E.U. in late 2001 agreed to continue its “critical engagement”with the government
of Sudan for another year, envisioning resumption of E.U. development
aid to Sudan by the end of 2002 if certain benchmarks (in human rights) were met.
As the peace talks under IGAD got underway, however,with E.U. members playing
a leading role, the goal shifted to one of encouraging Sudan and the SPLM/A to take
serious steps on the road to peace through the IGAD process, and maintaining a
common donor/international front on the peace issue.
As the year progressed, the E.U. expressed public concern about ongoing abuses
(such as the February bombing of the Bieh relief site). The E.U. demanded unrestricted
access for aid agencies to reach civilians affected by the civil war,which was
eventually accomplished in the context of the IGAD peace talks at Machakos.
