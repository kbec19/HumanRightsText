 SEYCHELLES
 Since 1979, Seychelles has been a socialist, one-party
 state headed by President France Albert Rene. The single
 party is the Seychelles People's Progressive Front (SPPF).
 Under President Rene's leadership, the government continues
 to strive for major social and economic changes, while
 insuring its self preservation by limiting and manipulating
 the political process. Seychelles' constitution does not
 contain a bill of rights; the protection of traditional
 civil rights is set forth in the preamble as a stated
 intention of the people. However, since legal safeguards
 against actions by the executive branch are minimal, civil
 liberties, while generally respected, exist at the sufferance
 of the government.
 The Rene Government concentrates significant resources on
 matters of internal and external security. This concentra-
 tion was heightened in the wake of the abortive November 25,
 1981 coup attempt, which apparently was organized abroad
 using external resources and personnel. Those few perpe-
 trators who did not/escape have been apprehended and are
 awaiting trial. Aside from the reimposition of a curfew, no
 emergency measures were enacted following the coup attempt.
 In the past, individuals suspected of opposition activities
 have been subject to surveillance, search, interrogation and
 arrest. Normal police matters are conducted by a professional
 and disciplined force modeled on the British system, and the
 criminal justice system is administered by an independent
 judiciary composed of contract judges trained-in British
 jurisprudence. As far as is known, no political prisoners
 have been incarcerated since the release, in mid-1980, of
 those individuals who had been arrested as an after-effect
 of the 1979 student riots.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The preamble to the new constitution states that it is the
 intention of the people of Seychelles to secure the right
 not to be subjected to torture. No allegations of torture
 of Seychellois in Seychelles have been received in 1981.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The preamble states it is the people's intention to secure
 the right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading
 treatment. Political prisoners released during 1979 and
 1980 reported being interrogated, but did not report cruel,
 inhuman or degrading treatment. There have been no in-
 stances of. summary or other execution. Prisoners live on an
 island just outside Victoria harbor and are free to f1sh,
 grow their own fruits and vegetables, and serve out their
 sentences under generally benign conditions. A uniformed,
 disciplined and respected prison service, on the British
 model, administers the prison.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no known incidents of the disappearance
 of individuals in Seychelles.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Although about 100 individuals were arrested in 1979 and
 held for several months as political prisoners, they have
 since been released or temporarily exiled. While currently
 there are believed to be no political prisoners, the govern-
 ment maintains the authority to detain suspects without
 filing charges and to control the movement of designated
 individuals. The constitution imposes no restraints on the
 president in carrying out his responsibilities, nor does it
 provide judicial recourse to safeguard individuals against
 arbitrary arrest or imprisonment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Seychelles' judicial system is based on the British
 model, and most judges are short-term contract third
 country nationals. Non-political offenders are assured
 fair public trials.
 According to the attorney general, the accused has a
 right to counsel. Legal aid is also available for
 serious cases heard before the supreme court, but not
 normally in magistrates court where lesser offenses
 are tried.
 Emergency powers permit detention without trial if the
 president signs a detention order. In that case there
 is no legal counsel because there is no trial. Political
 prisoners arrested in 1979 were never brought to trial
 and spent from three to seven months in jail.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Shortly after his installation in power, President Rene
 accorded the police broad powers of search, seizure and
 arrest without warrant. In practice these powers have been
 used sparingly. However, no effective legal safeguards
 exist against arbitrary invasion of the home. Released
 political detainees have complained of intimidating sur-
 veillance of their homes, but demolition or sealing of
 houses is not practiced.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The preamble of the constitution states the intention
 of the people to secure the enjoyment by every person
 in Seychelles of certain fundamental rights and freedoms,
 including freedom of thought, conscience and religion;
 freedom of opinion and expression; and freedom to assemble
 and associate peacefully in accordance with the law.
 In 1979, however, the law was changed, providing up to
 three years imprisonment of *any person who, with intent to
 bring the President into hatred, ridicule, or contempt,
 publishes any defamatory or insulting matter whether in
 writing, print, word of mouth or in any other manner."
 The president can ban publications for public security
 purposes. Any person who "prints, makes, imports,
 publishes, sells, supplies, offers for sale or supply,
 distributes, reproduces or has in his possession or under
 
 
 217
 his control any prohibited publication' can face two years
 imprisonment.
 The major newspaper and only radio station are both govern-
 ment owned and controlled. The Catholic Church publishes
 another small monthly paper, and a group of copra.exporters
 puts out a printed bulletin from time to time. The Far East
 Broadcasting Association (FEBA), a Protestant missionary
 group based in England, maintains a transmitter on Nahe.
 The broadcasts are uncensored and can be easily picked up
 locally. Newscasts from BBC and VOA can also be tuned in on
 short-wave radios.
 In addition to censoring excessive violence and explicit sex
 in films, a censorship committee is instructed to cut any
 segments which portray disrespect for governmental authority.
 The majority of films shown in Seychelles' only movie
 theater are American. International magazines--Time,
 Newsweek, Jeune Afrique--appear regularly on the newstands.
 For a Seychelles citizen, anti-government statements could,
 in theory, result in imprisonment as a political prisoner.
 Expatriates have been expelled on 24-hours notice without
 explanation. Freedom of speech is, thus, inhibite by the
 threat of confinement for Seychellois, or expulsion for
 citizenssof other countries.
 No organized opposition to the government is allowed.
 The Seychelles Peoples Progressive Front (SPPF), the only
 political party, controls the National Workers Union (NNU),
 the only labor union.
 The government.of Seychelles respects freedom of religion
 although it recognizes only four "Christian' denominations
 which can conduct 'official services: Catholics, Anglicans,
 Seventh Day Adventists, and Bahais. The only denomination
 officially proscribed is the Jehovah's Witnesses. Other.
 non-Christian faiths are tolerated.
 Approximately 96 percent of the population is Catholic
 and 2 percent Anglican. Both churches are headed by
 resident bishops.
 b. Freedom of Novement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Curfews restricting movement within the country, which
 have also affected foreign travel, have been imposed at
 various times, most recently following the attempted coup
 of November 25, 1981r a long-standing nine p.m. to
 five a.m. harbor curfew restricts marine traffic. Neither
 foreign travel nor emigration are restricted pr se,
 although repatriation may in some cases be aff-cte by the
 cause for expatriation.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The 1979 constitution implemented a single party state and
 designated the ruling SPPF as the only legitimate party.
 All political activity is restricted to the party and the
 government it controls. Opponents of single-party govern-
 ment, socialism, or the Rene government cannot organize
 in any manner. Government supporters, on the other hand,
 
 
 218
 receive a great deal of encouragement to participate in
 politics. The SPPF also serves as an ombudsman when
 Seychellois have grievances against a government agency;
 this process is open to both party and non-party members.
 Current SPPF membership is 8,000 out of an eligible
 population of 26,000. The SPPF constitution prohibits
 sexual discrimination. Women participate actively and
 occupy 9 of 25 seats in the elected peoples assembly.
 Problems of nationality, citizenship, and statelessness do
 not exist.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 No inquiries by outside organizations to investigate
 human rights in Seychelles are known to have been made in
 1981. In March 1980 the government accepted a visit by an
 Amnesty International mission inquiring into the detention of
 78 persons in November 1979 following an alleged coup plot.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Seychelles is one of the ten smallest countries in the
 world, distributed over 92 islands, some miniscule, in a
 200,000 square mile area of the Indian Ocean. Since the
 international airport opened on Mahe Island in 1971,
 Seychelles' economy has been dependent on tourism, which
 accounted for 40.8 percent of GNP in 1980, notwithstanding
 government efforts to diversify by expanding and developing
 agriculture and fishing. In 1981, government actions
 continued to increase public sector economic participation
 through the introduction of additional quasi-governmental
 organizations and by direct government take-over of economi-
 cally unviable hotels and restaurants. The traditionally
 laissez-faire nature of Seychelles' economy has been further
 eroded by the introduction of government price controls on
 most raw and processed foods, and mark-up controls on
 imported commodities. Seychelles' high per capita GNP
 ($1,400 in 1979, up from $500 in 1970) is, as noted, mainly
 the result of capital inflows from tourism. The majority of
 Seychellois remain far below this per capita income level.
 The government continues to improve already high standards
 of medical care, education, housing and nutrition.
 Medical care and prescription medication are available
 free of charge to all Seychellois at government owned
 and operated hospitals and community clinics. Seychellois
 have access to clinics staffed by either a general practi-
 tioner or a qualified nurse. The government has undertaken
 a low-key family planning program which reflects official
 concern over population growth (2 percent in 1979) and age
 distribution (40 percent of population less than 15).
 Nutrition is excellent by any standard and starvation is
 non-existent. Life expectancy for males is 61.9 years and
 for females 68.0. Infant mortality is 43.2 per 1000
 live births.
 Education in Seychelles is free and universally access-
 ible with adult literacy estimated at 58 per cent. Ninety-
 five percent of the eligible population group is enrolled in
 primary school. After grade nine, students who desire further
 education are obligated to enroll in a two year National
 
 
 219
 Youth Service, living apart from their families at the Port
 Launay youth camp on Mahe Island. Only those students who
 complete the Youth Service are eligible to progress to
 Seychelles College (comparable to U.S. senior high school).
 University level study can only be undertaken abroad.
 A national employment scheme was introduced in January
 1980 to reduce unemployment. One third of the potential
 labor force is unemployed or under-employed. The scheme
 offers daily employment on public works projects. The labor
 movement in Seychelles exerts considerable influence over
 employment conditions. The National Workers Union, which
 is associated with the Seychelles Peoples Progressive Front,
 fixes basic wage rates in conjunction with employers and
 the government. When vacancies occur, the Ministry of Labor
 determines from its register which candidates will be sent
 to an interview with the employer. Only when the list of
 qualified unemployed candidates is exhausted, can already
 employed candidates interview for the job. Women are
 employed in all job categories--from principal secretaries
 (vice minister) to streetsweepers--and are respected and
 paid on even terms with male co-workers.
 The government actively seeks to provide and improve housing
 for all citizens, particularly for low income residents on
 Mahe Island. Most Seychellois own their own homes on small
 plots of land, and are able to obtain government assistance
 for financing, repairs, and utilities.
 A social security scheme providing monthly payments based
 on need to the poor, disabled, and unemployed attempts to
 counterbalance unequal income distribution.
 Although economic progress during the last few years has
 been dramatic, the government must face a growing deficit in
 current account caused by a decline in tourism receipts.
 Capital inflows from tourism and foreign loans on concessional
 terms cannot bridge the growing current account deficit and
 the climate for business, and investment in particular, is
 worsening.
