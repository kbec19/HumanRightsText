VENEZUELA
As in the past, the most pressing human rights issues facing the government
of President Hugo Chávez involved crime and the criminal justice
system.High levels of violent crime placed great stress on public institutions,whose
level of professionalism was often low.Corruption and violence in the police forces
and the prison system remained endemic, while the judiciary—under-funded,
inefficient, and often corrupt—was incapable of dispensing justice in an efficient
manner.
The extrajudicial execution of criminal suspects by police continued to be a
major human rights problem.A disturbing recent development was the emergence
in some states of organized death squads, acting with impunity and even publishing
their hit lists in local newspapers.
President Chávez’s frequent outbursts against his political and media critics, coupled with his authoritarian style of governance, raised fears of encroachments
on civil liberties and free expression.However, as in previous years, Chávez’s rhetoric
was generally more aggressive than his actions.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
In the state of Portuguesa, a death squad composed of off-duty members of the
state police and National Guard was believed responsible for up to one hundred
killings of criminal suspects over the last two years, mainly in the cities of Acarigua
and Araure.Calling itself the “extermination group,”it selected its victims from lists
of wanted criminals openly published in the press. Given the apparent indifference
of the state government, police, and judges to the incidents, the killers reportedly
took to operating in broad daylight aboard police patrol cars. According to press
reports, they extorted large sums of money from those on their hit list and killed
them if they were unable to pay up.
In October 2000, members of the group murdered twenty-three-year-old
Jimmy Rodríguez, a third year law student, and his friend César Agray Meléndez.
Both were well known locally and neither was believed to have criminal connections.
In May,Rodríguez’ father, José Ramón Rodríguez,who had campaigned publicly
to bring his son’s killers to justice, was himself gunned down. A few days later,
Belmiro Gutiérrez, one of the principal witnesses in the Rodríguez-Agray killings,
was also murdered. In July, the government sent two prosecutors and large contingent
of police from Caracas to investigate these incidents.Many witnesses received
death threats.
Human rights groups accused Rodrigo Pérez Pérez, the chief of public security
of the Portuguesa state government, and the former chief of the State Police, Carlos
Navarro, of complicity in the activities of the death squad, but neither had been
charged by October.At least six state police officers, however,were arrested in connection
with the killings. On September 25 a large National Guard and police contingent,
acting on the orders of the attorney general, Isaías Rodríguez, raided the
state police headquarters. According to the press, they found that four of the six
detained officers were not in their cells, which contained liquor and cell phones.
The police also reportedly found illegal weapons, drugs, and the registration documents
of stolen cars in the building.
In June,Attorney General Isaías Rodríguez announced that the government was
also investigating death squad activity in the states of Yaracuy, Miranda,
Anzoátegui, and in metropolitan Caracas. The nongovernmental human rights
group Venezuelan Program for Education and Action on Human Rights (Programa
Venezolano de Educación-Acción en Derechos Humanos, PROVEA) denounced a
pattern of extrajudicial killings in the states of Barinas (with thirty-two such deaths
between January 2000 and June 2001), and Zulia, where ninety-eight people died
in “clashes” with police in 2000, and forty-three in the first four months of 2001.
Police often attempted to disguise deliberate killings by claiming that the victims
were killed in firefights.
In July, the Supreme Court granted a habeas corpus writ filed on behalf of Roberto Javier Hernández Paz,who “disappeared”after intelligence agents arrested
him in his home in the state of Vargas in December 1999. The court ordered the
prosecutor to renew investigations into Hernández’ “disappearance” and bring to
justice those responsible. Hernández was one of four people who “disappeared”
when intelligence agents and army paratroopers committed serious abuses during
efforts to control looting during flooding in Vargas state. In September the public
prosecutor brought charges of enforced disappearance against Jose Yañez Casimiro,
a DISIP officer implicated in the “disappearance” of Oscar Blanco Romero, and
against Justiniano Martínez Carreño for covering up Blanco’s illegal arrest.
The progressive new code of penal procedures, introduced in 1999 under the
government of Rafael Caldera, came under fire as the public security crisis worsened.
With the code being scapegoated for the weaknesses of law enforcement, calls
multiplied for its reform, in particular, to tighten its provisions on parole and pretrial
release, and to eliminate jury trials.
Prison conditions remained inhumane and, because of inter-prisoner violence,
often life-threatening. Despite a significant reduction in the numbers of prisoners
awaiting trial, levels of inmate violence were extremely high, abetted by insufficient
staffing and equipment,widespread corruption among guards, and the unchecked
entry into prisons of narcotics and firearms. In March, two prisoners died and
forty-one were wounded in a gun battle between rival gangs in the El Rodeo prison
in Miranda state. One of the dead, Edgard Alexander Bazán, was killed when he
picked up a hand grenade another prisoner had thrown toward him. The prison
with the worst record of inmate violence was Yare I, in Miranda state,where at least
twenty inmates died in separate incidents from April to August, as gangs competed
to control the market in drugs and weapons.
Venezuela’s treatment of refugees from neighboring Colombia raised serious
concerns. In October 2000, Venezuelan authorities forcibly returned at least
seven asylum seekers who had fled paramilitary violence in their villages, having
barred access to the group by the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR). In February human rights and church groups expressed
concern about the plight of hundreds of Colombians who had crossed into Zulia
state to escape political violence in Colombia. The refugees, whose presence both
the Venezuelan and Colombian governments initially denied,were reported to be
undocumented and suffering from malnutrition and disease. In March, the Inter-
American Commission on Human Rights issued an urgent appeal to the
Venezuelan government not to return the 287 refugees and to guarantee their
safety, provide them with humanitarian assistance, and consider their applications
for refugee status.
In August, the National Assembly approved an Organic Law on Refugees and
Asylum Seekers, drafted with the participation of nongovernmental human rights
groups. The new law prohibited the forcible return of asylum seekers and established
a National Commission for Refugees to consider asylum applications.
According to PROVEA,more than one hundred such applications had been awaiting
consideration since July 1999.
President Chávez’s authoritarian tendencies continued to reveal themselves in
efforts to undermine civil society institutions such as labor unions and the press.
Yet, even as Chávez threatened severe measures—as in May when he proposed
declaring a state of emergency—his actions were rarely as drastic as his more
alarmist critics expected.
On December 3, 2000, at Chávez’s behest, the government held, and won, a
national referendum to remove the leadership of the country’s discredited trade
union federations.The proposal was in breach of treaty obligations mandating that
the government respect the autonomy of labor organizations.After repeated postponements,
new union elections held under the auspices of the National Electoral
Council, a state body, were scheduled for October.
Although press freedom was generally respected, Chávez continued to deliver
blistering attacks on his press critics in his weekly television show and other public
appearances, as well as in calls placed by him to radio and television networks.
Chávez’s aversion to criticism was also evident in his June announcement that “foreigners
who come here to slander Venezuela will be expelled.” His words were
believed to be a reaction to comments made during a visit to Venezuela by Peruvian
presidential candidate Lourdes Flores,who had compared Chávez’s government to
that of deposed President Alberto Fujimori of Peru.
Also in June, the Supreme Court issued a decision interpreting a controversial
clause in Venezuela’s new constitution, a document drafted under Chávez’ direction.
In a much-criticized ruling, the court found that article 58 of the constitution
guaranteeing the right to “timely, truthful, and impartial information” imposed
enforceable obligations on the media.The court held that media outlets must avoid
“publishing false news or news that is manipulated with half truths; disinformation
that denies the opportunity to know the reality of the news; and speculation or
biased information to obtain a goal with regard to someone or something.” The
court also concluded that article 58 required publications to be ideologically pluralistic
unless their editorial line was made explicit.
The Supreme Court ruling raised fears that article 58 would be used to gag press
critics of the government. Indeed, in October, the National Commission of
Telecommunications (Comisión Nacional de Telecomunicaciones, CONATEL)
began an investigation into the conduct of the Venezuelan television network
Globovisión, for allegedly having broadcast “false, misleading or tendentious information,”
an offense under Venezuela’s Radiocommunications Regulations. In September,
the network aired the statement of a taxi driver who claimed that nine
colleagues had been killed by criminals, when in fact only one had died. President
Chavez urged the station to “reflect before it is too late,” and threatened to “apply
mechanisms for the defense of the national interest, the truth, and public order.”
For its error,which it promptly corrected, the station was potentially liable to a fine
or the suspension of its broadcasting license.
On January 7,members of the Directorate ofMilitary Intelligence (Dirección de
Inteligencia Militar, DIM) detained lawyer and academic Pablo Aure Sánchez in
response to a letter he wrote ridiculing the army that was published in a national
newspaper. Aure was stripped of his clothes and spent the night in a cramped cell
without access to a toilet. Although he was released for health reasons three days
later, Aure faced charges under an article 505 of the code of military justice, which
mandates a three- to five-year sentence for anyone who “insults, offends or disparages the armed forces.”Disregarding objections made by the attorney general and
the human rights ombudsman,who argued that military jurisdiction over civilians
was unconstitutional, the military prosecutor refused to turn the case over to the
civilian courts.
On June 24, Venezuelan military intelligence agents arrested Vladimiro Montesinos,
the shadowy head of Peru’s National Intelligence Service and the power
behind the throne of deposed President Alberto Fujimori, in Caracas.Montesinos
was promptly deported to Peru,where he was imprisoned on charges of corruption
and human rights abuse. Since Montesinos fled Peru amidst a bribery scandal in
October 2000, persistent rumors had circulated that he was hiding in Venezuela
with the protection of government officials. The strongest suspicions centered on
members of the Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services (Dirección de
los Servicios de Inteligencia y Prevención, DISIP) and on its director, Eliecer Otaiza,
who was fired by Chávez days before Montesinos’ arrest.However, investigations by
the Attorney General’s Office and two parliamentary commissions of inquiry failed
to clarify questions regarding the government’s involvement.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
The year began with positive overtures by the Chávez government toward
human rights groups,but little real cooperation resulted. In January,Human Rights
Watch was present as an observer at a meeting on public security convened by Minister
of the Interior and Justice Luis Alfonso Dávila with representatives of the
Venezuelan human rights community, and attended by cabinet ministers, the attorney
general, the president of the Supreme Court, and the human rights ombudsman.
The participants agreed to form a permanent advisory commission to ensure
an ongoing dialogue between the government and human rights groups, particularly
on crime control policy. However, by October the proposal had not been
implemented.
In January, the press reported that Liliana Ortega, executive director of the
respected Committee of Relatives ofVictims of the Events of February-March 1989
(Comité de Familiares de los Víctimas de los Sucesos de Febrero-Marzo de 1989,
COFAVIC), was on a list of persons under investigation by DISIP for “plotting
against the government.” The following month, however, DISIP’s director denied
the allegations.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
In March the Human Rights Committee reviewed Venezuela’s record of compliance
with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In its concluding
observations, the committee expressed grave concern at reports of
“disappearances”and extrajudicial executions, and regarding the failure of the state authorities to investigate them and bring those responsible to justice. It also urged
Venezuela to pass a law codifying torture as a crime, and expressed concern that the
extended reform of the judiciary could threaten its independence. In May, the
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights called on Venezuela to ratify
the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees and to issue asylum applicants with
appropriate documentation. It considered that Venezuela’s failure to do so “seriously
hinders their enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, including the
rights to work, health and education.”
Organization of American States (OAS)
In its annual report for the year 2000, the Inter-American Commission on
Human Rights expressed concern about restrictions on freedom of expression in
Venezuela. The special rapporteur on freedom of expression raised the case of
Pablo Aure as an example of the continuing problems posed by contempt of
authority laws.
In February the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights issued an
urgent appeal to the Venezuelan government with regard to criminal defamation
proceedings targeting journalist Pablo López Ulacio. The proceedings, brought by
a prominent businessman whom Ulacio had accused of corrupt business practices,
were flawed by the evident partiality of the judges.Yet the government failed to take
the measures requested by the commission, and in July a Caracas judge issued
another order for López’ arrest.
Venezuela also continued to flout a 1996 ruling of the Inter-American Court on
Human Rights. The court had ordered Venezuela to compensate the relatives of
fourteen fishermen extrajudicially executed at El Amparo in Apure state in October
1988, and to bring to justice those responsible.
United States
Neither the Clinton nor Bush administrations commented publicly on human
rights. The State Department’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2000
highlighted the problem of extrajudicial executions and “disappearances,” noting
that the perpetrators acted with “near impunity.” High-level Venezuelan officials,
including Defense Minister José Vicente Rangel and Foreign Minister Luis Alfonso
Dávila, criticized the report.
