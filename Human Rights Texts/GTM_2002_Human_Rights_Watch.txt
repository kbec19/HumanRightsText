HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Aside from the successful conclusion of one landmark trial,Guatemala made little
progress in addressing persistent human rights problems, with certain conditions
worsening. State agents were responsible for some abuses, while others were
carried out by non-state actors who were able to operate with impunity because
their crimes were not adequately investigated. There were increased reports of
threats and violence targeting human rights advocates, labor leaders, judges, prosecutors
and journalists.Meanwhile, the army’s continued influence over the civilian
government was evidenced by President Alfonso Portillo’s decision to postpone
the dismantling of the Presidential Guard (Estado Mayor Presidencial, EMP), an
elite army corps associated with past human rights violations. The 1996 peace
accords had called for the dismantling of the EMP.
One positive development was the successful prosecution of those responsible
for the murder of Bishop Juan Gerardi,who was bludgeoned to death in April 1998,
two days after he released the Catholic Church’s report on human rights abuses
during Guatemala’s internal conflict which ended in 1996. In June, a three-judge
tribunal found retired army Col. Byron Lima Estrada and his son, army Capt.
Byron Lima Oliva, guilty of murder. The two men were sentenced to thirty years in
prison. Also convicted were former presidential bodyguard José Obdulio Villanueva
and Roman Catholic priest Mario Orantes, who received sentences of
thirty years and twenty years respectively.
A major obstacle to investigating and prosecuting human rights violations committed
by the army was the intimidation of prosecutors, judges and witnesses
through terror tactics. In this, the Gerardi trial was no exception. From the outset,
key participants in the case were subjected to “systematic” and “planned” harassment
that “intensified in the key procedural moments”of the trial, according to the
United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala (Misión de Verificación de las
Naciones Unidas en Guatemala,MINUGUA). One judge, one prosecutor, and several
witnesses fled the country before the trial got underway after receiving death
threats. In January, Luis García Pontaza, a potential defense witness with links to
organized crime, was found dead in a Guatemala City jail.Prior to his death, he told
MINUGUA that he had resisted pressure from the EMP to testify that certain individuals
linked to the Catholic Church had been involved in the Bishop’s murder.
One of the trial judges, Yasmín Barrios Aguilar, reported that two strangers
attempted to break into her home a week before the trial and on March 21, the day
before the oral debate was scheduled to begin, grenades were exploded at the back
of her home.The special prosecutor for the case, Leopoldo Zeissig, reported receiving
anonymous telephoned threats and being tailed by strangers.After the trial concluded,
he fled the country, as did another witness.
While the trial’s outcome represented an enormous advance for the country,
there was little or no progress made in several of the other high-profile human
rights cases before the Guatemalan courts. The prosecution of soldiers implicated
in the 1995 massacre in Xamán, department of Alta Verapaz, remained in its preliminary
stages six years after the crime, and there were no advances in the prosecution,
begun in 1994, of soldiers accused of perpetrating the 1982 massacre in Dos
Erres, department of Petén.After years of delay the trial of military officers accused
of ordering the 1990 assassination of anthropologist Myrna Mack was set to begin
in October 2001.
Impunity also remained a serious problem in less prominent cases.MINUGUA
documented hundreds of human rights abuses during the year, the majority of
which it attributed to the failure of government authorities to investigate and punish
the perpetrators adequately. One case that exemplified this pattern of failure
involved the family of retired Gen.Otto Pérez Molina,who had helped to negotiate
the 1996 peace accords and was preparing to launch a new political party. In
November 2000, unknown assailants in an automobile shot and wounded his
daughter-in-law. Then, in February 2001, assailants attacked and wounded his
daughter and,moments later, shot and killed the driver of a car traveling next to one
his wife was driving.Yet, the authorities mounted no serious investigation into the
case, failing even to take testimony from an army officer who witnessed the fatal
attack. The general’s family left the country for their own safety. Francisco Arnoldo
Aguilar,whose wife was the driver killed in the February attack, pressed for an official
investigation and urged the creation of a citizens’ group to combat impunity. In
May, however, he was assassinated in front of his home in circumstances that,
MINUGUA said, ruled out robbery as a motive. The authorities nonetheless
insisted that it was a common crime.
The authorities also failed to take strong action against anti-union violence that
undermined workers’ right to freedom of association. In March, twenty-four men were tried for a 1999 incident in which five leaders of the Union of Banana Workers
of Izabal (Sindicato de Trabajadores Bananeros de Izabal, SITRABI) were held
at gunpoint, ordered to quit the union and their jobs, and call off a planned work
stoppage in protest against the firing of 918 banana workers in violation of a collective
bargaining agreement. They were indicted on lesser charges of false imprisonment
and coercion, however, rather than for kidnapping or other crimes that
carry a mandatory prison sentence.All but two were convicted; they received threeand-
a-half year prison sentences but these were immediately commuted upon payment
of fines.With these men again at large, the five SITRABI leaders feared for
their safety and that of their families, and fled the country.
The absence of effective law enforcement and the high incidence of common
crime contributed to a climate of insecurity, and the continued use of lynching as a
form of vigilante justice. MINUGUA documented eighty-eight lynchings between
July 2000 and June 2001, resulting in thirty-seven deaths. Local authorities often
played a role in inciting and perpetrating lynchings.
Officers of the National Civilian Police (Policía Nacional Civil, PNC) were
responsible for numerous human rights violations, including extrajudicial executions
and torture, and for obstructing justice. In October 2000, Rolando Barillas
Herrera was detained by two PNC agents in Gualán, Zacapa, brought to a station,
and put in cell at midnight. At 5:00 a.m., Barillas was found dead from asphyxiation.
A forensic exam found signs of beating and ruled out suicide.Yet, a year later,
government investigators still had not identified those responsible for the killing.
In April 2001, the PNC detained Julio Alberto Casasola and William Cotom Rodas
in Quetzaltenango, having allegedly caught them in the process of stealing a car.
The two were tortured and then transferred to a prison. The next day,Casasola was
brought to a hospital where he died as a result of the blows he had received from the
police.
There was a marked increase in threats made against people who challenged the
actions of public authorities. In March, the president of the Constitutional Court,
Judge Conchita Mazariegos, reported that she had received threatening phone calls
and that shots had been fired at her house. Earlier that month, the Constitutional
Court had lifted the immunity of members of Congress, including Gen. Efraín Ríos
Montt, so that they could face prosecution for illegally altering the text of a law after
it had been voted on by Congress. Three days before the attack on Judge Mazariegos’s
home, the court had ruled unconstitutional a decree passed by General Ríos
Montt’s party that would allow him and his colleagues to retain their congressional
seats during their prosecution.
Also in March, several members of Congress who defected from the ruling
Guatemalan Republican Front party (Frente Republicana Guatemalteca, FRG),
reported being subject to threats and acts of intimidation. These politicians had
joined the opposition National Unity of Hope party (Unidad Nacional de la Esperanza,
UNE). The UNE’s offices had previously been raided in August 2000 by
people who stole documents and left threatening messages behind.
One journalist was killed; others harassed and threatened, apparently to influence
their reporting. Radio journalist Jorge Mynor Alegría was assassinated by
unknown assailants in September in the port city of Puerto Barrios, department of Izabal. A colleague said that before his killing Alegría had rejected an attempt by
local municipal authorities to bribe him to stop criticizing local corruption in his
broadcasts. Other journalists received threats, including Claudia Méndez Villaseñor
of El Periódico, who reported receiving telephone threats from two government
officials in January when she was investigating alleged government
corruption. In March, Silvia Gereda and Martín Juárez, two other El Períodico journalists
reported receiving death threats and being assaulted. Juárez told MINUGUA
that a car followed him for two hours before he was intercepted and forced to stop
by another car, whose occupants then got out and pointed a gun at his head and
threatened to kill him. The same month, Gustavo Soberanis of Siglo XXI, was
threatened with a firearm by the comptroller of the president’s office (Contralor
General de Cuentas) when he tried to interview him about its expenses. Journalists
in the departments of Zacapa, Quetzaltenango, and Chiqimula also reported
receiving death threats. In June, the Public Ministry created a Special Prosecutor’s
Office for the Protection of Journalists and Unionized Workers (Fiscalía Especial
para la Protección a Periodistas y Sindicalistas).
Union leaders also continued to be subject to threats. In February, union leaders
who organized a work stoppage in the Puerto Barrios harbor received threats and
were later fired. In May and June, union leaders in two Izabal banana plantations
were also subject to firings and death threats.And during the year, union members
were threatened and subject to discriminatory firing by municipal mayors in several
towns throughout the country.
Discrimination remained a problem for indigenous people who made up
roughly half the country’s population.They faced unequal access to education, justice,
health and other government services. According to MINUGUA, the government’s
record with regard to implementing the 1996 peace accords was particularly
poor in the area of indigenous people’s rights.
Guatemala continued to violate its international treaty obligations in its
application of the death penalty. In November 2001, twenty-eight prisoners were
on death row. Thirteen of them had been sentenced for kidnappings that did not
result in death, a crime that was not a capital offense when the American Convention
on Human Rights entered into force. Because the American Convention
prohibited extending the death penalty to cover additional crimes, Guatemala’s
Constitutional Court ruled in October 2000 that the laws extending the death
penalty to non-fatal kidnappings violated Guatemala’s obligations under the
Convention. In June, however, a newly constituted court overturned that earlier
ruling.
In October 2000, Guatemala ratified the Additional Protocol to the American
Convention on Human Rights in the Area of Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
In 2001, Guatemala experienced an alarming rise in the number of threats and
incidents of harassment and targeted violence against human rights advocates.
MINUGUA documented 171 such cases between July 2000 and June 2001 and concluded
that they were the result of “systematic action.”
In November 2000, the Rigoberta Menchú Foundation received threats in the
days leading up to a ruling by Spain’s highest court (the Audiencia Nacional de
España) on a genocide case that the foundation had brought before it. In May, two
members of the organization Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared of Guatemala
(Familiares de Detenidos-Desaparecidos de Guatemala, FAMDEGUA) were
assaulted outside their Guatemala City office.Two armed men forced their way into
their car and interrogated them about the organization’s work while driving them
around the city, before releasing the two FAMDEGUA activists and escaping in
their car. The Center for Studies, Information and Basis for Social Action (Centro
de Estudios, Investigación y Bases para la Acción Social, CEIBAS) reported that its
office was repeatedly burgled between February and May, and the Association for
Justice and Reconciliation (Asociación Justicia y Reconciliación, AJR) reported that
its president was attacked and wounded by a man with a knife,who threatened him
and other witnesses in a criminal complaint that the organization had brought
against General Ríos Montt and other former military commanders for genocide
and crimes against humanity. In June, an Amnesty International representative
undertaking research on human rights in Guatemala was the victim of an apparent
abduction attempt by unidentified assailants in her Guatemala City hotel.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
The international community continued to play a prominent role in monitoring
the Guatemalan government’s compliance with the 1996 peace accords and
with international human rights norms. The United Nations and the Organization
of American States provided mechanisms to which Guatemalans could denounce
human rights abuses by the government. The United States also monitored
Guatemala’s human rights record, though its responses to this record varied, with
the Senate penalizing its shortcomings while the United States Trade Representative
rewarded its perceived gains.
United Nations and
the Organization of American States (OAS)
The United Nations verification mission,MINUGUA, continued its institutionbuilding
activities as well as playing a central role in monitoring compliance with
the peace accords. MINUGUA’s reports contained detailed human rights analyses
and indicated that significant aspects of the accords remained unimplemented. In
September, MINUGUA issued a human rights report for the period July 2000 to
June 2001, and at other times it issued communiqués on specific human rights
abuses.
The U.N. special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Param
Cumaraswamy, visited Guatemala in May and found that the climate of insecurity
for members of the legal community continued to undermine the rule of law. He noted that recommendations he made after a 1999 visit had been largely ignored by
government authorities.
In November 2000, the Committee against Torture expressed concern about a
“deterioration” of the human-rights situation in Guatemala, and recommended,
among other things, that independent commissions be established to monitor the
performance of the police and to investigate cases of kidnapping and “disappearances.”
In May, the Committee on the Rights of the Child met with the Guatemalan government
to discuss its implementation of the Rights of the Child. The committee
expressed concern that violence against children was increasing in Guatemala and
urged the government to adopt legislation that would protect the children’s rights.
In July, the Human Rights Committee, responding to a report submitted by the
Guatemala government, commended Guatemala for providing resources for
human rights institutions, yet expressed concern at ongoing “glaring and systematic
violations.” It recommended that the Guatemalan government give priority to
investigating and bringing to justice the perpetrators of human rights violations.
The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights issued four case reports on
Guatemala. In one, it urged the government to reform provisions of the civil code
that imposed unequal spousal and familial obligations on women and men. In the
other three, it called for the government to investigate and punish extrajudicial executions,
forced disappearances and other serious human rights violations committed
by the security forces during the 1980s and 1990s, and to compensate victims’
families.
United States
In July, the United States Senate voted to maintain a ban on regular military
training and funding for Guatemala’s military. The report that accompanied the
Senate foreign operations bill cited the Guatemalan government’s failure to dismantle
the EMP and to address the deteriorating human rights situation.
In October 2000, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) took the
unprecedented step of initiating a review of Guatemala’s status as a beneficiary of
the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) largely in response to the failure
of government authorities to adequately punish anti-union violence. A review
examines a country’s compliance with certain internationally-recognized workers’
rights to determine its eligibility for GSP tariff benefits. In May 2001, the Bush
administration’s new USTR lifted the review of Guatemala’s beneficiary status, citing
as positive government steps the reinstatement of illegally dismissed banana
workers, and the conviction of the twenty-two gunmen involved in the October 13,
1999 incident. In fact, the banana workers’ reinstatement was the result of a
negotiated settlement between the workers and management not governmental
intervention.
