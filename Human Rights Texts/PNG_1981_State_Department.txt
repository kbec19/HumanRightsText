 PAPUA NEW GUINEA
 Papua New Guinea is the largest independent (since 1975)
 island country in the South Pacific. It is also the most
 diverse with over 700 languages, and local affiliations
 are often far stronger than allegiances to the national
 government. Papua New Guinea is a parliamentary democracy,
 with a unicameral legislature. Significant powers are dele-
 gated by the central government to provincial governments
 which are popularly elected. The diverse nature of the
 population and the rapid transition from a traditional to
 a modern way of life have presented many challenges to
 national unity. This has, at times, made the extension of
 government to all sectors of the country difficult. Despite
 these pressures, Papua New Guinea has created democratic
 institutions and has demonstrated genuine concern for human
 rights. The constitution, a long and comprehensive document,
 enumerates an extensive list of personal freedoms, all of
 which are guaranteed and protected. In practice, Papua New
 Guinea has an excellent record of observing and protecting
 human rights. There is a strong commitment to abide by the
 numerous human rights guarantees provided in the constitution.
 Complaints of abuse are rare and openly and quickly investigated.
 I.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 There is no torture in Papua New Guinea. It is prohibited
 by law (section 36 of the constitution) and custom.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is
 illegal, and not practiced or condoned. There are no
 executions of any kind in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Treatment
 of prisoners is fair and humane. Prison conditions in PNG
 are generally good. Most prisons are minimum security facili-
 ties. If there are abuses, prisoners have the right to complain
 to the ombudsman commission with the confidentiality of their
 correspondence guaranteed. Public defenders are available.
 The Papua New Guinea Red Cross has access to detainees.
 c.   Disappearances
 There are no "disappeared" persons in Papua New Guinea.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There are no political prisoners in Papua New Guinea.
 Habeas corpus exists and is honored in practice.
 Preventive detention does not occur. Wrongful arrest
 is prohibited by the constitution (sections 58 and 59)
 and the Arrest Act provides a remedy. The time period
 between arrest and trial is generally under 90 days.
 Accused persons are allowed visitors.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair hearing and a fair trial is guaranteed
 by law. Trials are open to the public. Defendants are
 entitled to counsel, and counsels have free access to
 defendants. Consultations between counsel and defendant

 may be held in private. There is no harassment of defense
 counsels by the government. Defendants are quickly made
 aware in court of the charges brought against them, and
 they and their lawyers can inform themselves of the evidence
 on which charges are based. Papua New Guinea's courts are
 independent of executive or military control.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 Section 44 of the constitution insures sanctity of the home,
 and the Search Act requires a warrant. Courts issue warrants.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These rights are protected by law. There is a free press
 with three independent newspaper companies. There is only
 one radio station and it is government-owned. It apears
 unfettered in news reporting and often carries news items
 unfavorable to the government. Australian radio stations
 can easily be picked up on the medium wave broadcast band,
 particularly during evening hours. There is no television
 in PNG. Freedom of religion is guaranteed and most major
 western religious groups have many adherents in PNG.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Papua New Guineans are free to travel within the country
 and abroad. Passport fees are not excessive. There are few
 refugees in Papua New Guinea. Those refugees that exist
 come principally from the neighboring Indonesian province
 of Irian Jaya. Most have been resettled within Papua New
 Guinea. Some considered "security risks" have found
 residence elsewhere through the facilities of the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. A small number
 considered economic refugees have returned to Indonesia.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Papua New Guinea's political processes are free and open.
 Elections are fair, party affiliations are less important
 than traditional affiliations, and ideological positions are
 not sharply drawn between parties. Although women play a
 role in the political arena, because of traditional social
 factors they are not yet fully integrated into the nation's
 political process. As a matter of law, discrimination based
 on sex is impermissible; nor are there restrictions against
 women participating in the political process. Three of the
 109 members of parliament are women. One woman is the leader
 of a political party. Labor unions may organize, bargain
 collectively and strike.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no allegations of violations of human rights
 by the Papua New Guinea Government by international or non-
 governmental agencies.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 Traditional culture continues to bind PNG society together.
 Less than one-tenth of the population live in towns with
 more than 10,000 people. There is a pattern of "circular
 mobility" whereby urban residents return to their villages.
 
 
 659
 Nearly every educated Papua New Guinean remains in the
 country.
 Eighty-five percent of the population live, for the most
 part, outside the cash economy, selling produce or their
 labor when they need money to purchase goods now considered
 necessities. Although in 1979, 10 percent of the population
 in urban areas and 75 percent in rural areas were considered
 to be below the absolute poverty level, most of the popula-
 tion easily produces enough to maintain adequate nutrition
 levels.
 According to available economic indicators, life has improved
 in the last decade in Papua New Guinea. Per capita GNP rose
 from $360 in 1970 to $660 in 1979. Infant mortality declined
 from 159 per thousand live births in 1969 to 106 in 1979;
 caloric intake (the ratio of calorie supply available for
 consumption relative to nutritional requirements) rose from
 76 in 1960 to 85 in 1979. School enrollment rose from 52
 percent of school-age children in 1970 to 60 percent in 1979.
 The rate of population growth rose from 1.8 percent in 1960 to
 2.3 percent in 1979. The government provides education, health,
 and social services on a non-discriminatory basis. However,
 the systems delivering these services are facing serious
 challenges because the world-wide recession has reduced
 government revenues derived from commodity exports. Whereas
 the government had been planning to increase its real ex-
 penditures by 3 percent annually (with most of the new funds
 allocated for basic infrastructure development -- roads,
 schools, ports and power generation), the decline in tax
 revenue has forced the government to plan for a 4 percent
 real decline in 1982 expenditures and perhaps a similar
 reduction in 1983.
