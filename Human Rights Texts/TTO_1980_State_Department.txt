 TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
 A former British colony, Trinidad and Tobago inherited
 many of its political and legal forms and practices-
 -strongly emphasizing rights of the person--from the
 United Kingdom. Multi-racial and religiously diverse,
 the country is a stable, multi-party, parliamentary
 democracy with a generally excellent record of human
 rights observance. The judiciary is independent and
 the Privy Council in the United Kingdom serves as
 the court of final appeal.
 The economy is based on free enterprise with mixed
 private/state ownership of many of the major facilities.
 The tax system is progressive. The literacy rate
 is over 95 percent. There is universal adult suffrage
 (from age 18), and free and fair elections are held
 regularly. The people's National Movement has remained
 in power through victories at the polls since before
 independence was attained in 1962. The "independence
 constitution" was superseded in 1976 by a republican
 constitution which, like its predecessor, enshrines
 internationally-accepted fundamental rights and freedoms
 without discrimination by reason of race, origin,
 color, religion or sex. Occasional charges of over-
 zealousness by the police, and excessive delays between
 arrest and trial are discussed openly and critically,
 bearing witness to the freedom of expression which
 the citizens enjoy and the attention the public gives
 to allegations of shortcomings in the country's adminis-
 tration of justice.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is forbidden under the law and is not permitted
 in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The constitution forbids cruel and unusual treatment
 or punishment and this prohibition is generally observed
 in practice. From time to time there have been allegations
 of excessive police roughness in individual cases.
 On occasion police officers have been punished for
 such illegal behavior. Despite some improvements
 in recent years, physical conditions in the prisons
 remain harsh. A commission of inquiry into prison
 conditions, headed by the Anglican bishop, was established
 in 1974, and, following numerous public sessions and
 public hearings, submitted its final report and recommen-
 dations in February 1980. The report recommended
 remedial measures to stop police roughness and to
 improve prison conditions. Thus far, however, only
 some minor improvements in prison conditions have
 been made.
 c. Disappearances.
 There are no reports of disappearances.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 
 
 539
 Protection against arbitrary detention or imprisonment
 is constitutionally guaranteed, as is the remedy of
 habeas corpus. There have been instances, however,
 when a suspected person has been held under detention
 for some time before charges were formally laid against
 him. There are more frequent charges of excessive
 delays between arrest and trial. The chief justice
 has described these delays as "a blot on the due adminis-
 tration of justice". Both shortcomings result from
 an overburdened legal system and are not a consequence
 of government policy. The report of a commission of
 inquiry has recommended measures to correct these short-
 comings. There are no political prisoners.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of accused persons to a fair and public hearing
 by an independent and impartial tribunal in criminal
 cases is guaranteed under the constitution and is observed
 in practice. In addition, the state provides legal
 aid to impecunious citizens in both civil and criminal
 cases.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution provides for security of the person
 and the sanctity of the home. These provisions are,
 for the most part, observed. There have been press
 comments about alleged over-zealous house searches
 and the issuance of search warrants without sufficient
 cause.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education.
 Trinidad and Tobago is a developing nation. Rapid
 economic progress began after oil prices were increased
 in 1974. The government's economic development strategy
 centers around plans for construction of a number of
 high-technology industrial projects which will benefit
 from Trinidad and Tobago's extensive gas reserves.
 Implementation is now proceeding. The manufacturing
 sector also is being encouraged and is expanding.
 Capital formation, financed both officially and privately,
 has been at a high level in recent years. Infrastructure
 development is moving ahead in tandem with the industrial
 plants.
 Implementation of this industrial development program
 and other major construction projects has helped to
 maintain a substantial rate of economic growth. Real
 growth in 1978 was estimated at 7.7 percent, following
 growth of 11.7 percent in 1977. Per capita income
 (for a population of 1.2 million increasing annually
 at about 1.5 percent) is now estimated at about $3,750.
 The right to the enjoyment of property, which is, for
 the most part, privately held and transacted, is protected
 by the constitution. Most farmland is privately owned
 and the majority of landholdings is small, with nearly
 half under five acres. Subsistence farming is on the
 decline. A government program of land redistribution-
 -from its own land and from those large estates sold
 to the government--encourages the establishment of
 medium-sized family farms (5-20 acres) devoted to cash
 
 
 54O
 crops.
 Largely as a result of the rapid expansion of the economy
 in recent years, the country has recorded a significant
 reduction in the rate of unemployment. From a high
 of 15.2 percent in 1975, this had fallen to 11.9 percent
 in 1979, and labor shortages are reported in some skilled
 and semi-skilled jobs. The government provides jobs
 for large numbers of the unemployed in a public works
 program. Workers in the stronger labor unions, especially
 in the industrial sector, have been particularly successful
 in negotiating large wage increases. Unions have also
 gained improvements in working conditions.
 Expenditures in the area of social needs (housing,
 health, education and welfare) account for about one-
 third of the national budget. Staple food items, important
 elements in the budgets of lower income groups, are
 kept at relatively low prices through government subsidies,
 and a free school lunch program-now functioning on
 a limited scale--is being expanded. Food stamps are
 available to the elderly and other needy persons.
 Free health care is available and accounts for 10.6
 percent of government expenditures (1978). One major
 new hospital has been built, plans are underway for
 modernizing and expanding the country's two biggest
 hospitals, and a network of rural health care centers
 is about 80 percent complete. Health conditions generally
 are good. The mortality rate and the incidence of
 most diseases are declining. Life expectancy (1970
 figures) is 64 for males and 68 for females. The 1976
 infant mortality rate (per 1,000 population) was 27.2.
 Population per hospital bed (1975) was 455; and population
 per physician (19751 was 1,948.
 The education system, which is free through secondary
 school and accounts for 19.2 percent of government
 expenditure (1978), is being expanded and revised better
 to prepare those who enter directly into the job market.
 The literacy rate is over 95 percent. Government and
 private pensions are sufficient to provide for human
 needs and at least a minimal standard of living for
 retirees. A national insurance (social security) plan,
 to which both employers and employees contribute, is
 also in effect. Benefits under this plan are relatively
 generous and are expanding.
 Women receive the same pay as men for the same work
 and occupy many important positions in government,
 the professions and business. There are women in the
 police force, and the first group of women soldiers
 recently graduated from the army's training school.
 Income levels are quite diverse. The poorest 40 percent
 of the population (in 1975) received about 11 percent
 of total income, and the top 10 percent received over
 31 percent, while the middle 50 percent received 57
 percent.
 Tobago, only one-sixteenth as large as Trinidad, has
 less than four percent of the two-island nation's population.
 Some consider that it has benefited much less from
 the recent economic prosperity than Trinidad because
 less investment is being directed there. There are
 complaints of higher prices, more frequent and serious
 
 
 541
 food and other supply shortages in Tobago than in Trinidad.
 Following persistent calls by Tobagonians for a measure
 of self-government, a Tobago "self-government" bill
 was enacted in September 1980, which gives Tobagonians
 a limited degree of autonomy within the unitary state
 of Trinidad and Tobago.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of expression, the press, religious belief
 and observance, association and assembly is consti-
 tutionally guaranteed and respected in practice. Public
 meetings are allowed, but permits must be obtained
 in advance from the police. The government does not
 impede labor unions in their legally guaranteed rights
 to organize, negotiate, and strike, except that strikes
 are prohibited by law in essential services (police,
 firemen, health and sanitation services, power and
 telephone workers, civil servants, and the workers
 at the country's one major steel mill.) Trade union
 organization is extensive, covering about 30 percent
 of the work force, and collective bargaining is vigorous
 and widespread. The ministry of labor is an impartial
 mediator in labor disputes.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement within
 the country, foreign travel and emigration, all of
 which are covered under the constitution's freedom
 of movement provision. Trinidad and Tobago long has
 served as a haven for people from neighboring areas
 seeking a better economic future. In turn, many people
 have emigrated from the country for similar reasons.
 All citizens have the right to re-enter the country,
 and this right is observed in practice.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 All citizens, regardless of sex, race or religion,
 can take part in the political process. The right to
 join political parties and to express political views
 is guaranteed by the constitution. Numerous political
 parties exist and participate in free elections, which
 are held regularly.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-government Investigations of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights.
 The government of Trinidad and Tobago supports the
 international observance of human rights and does not
 object in principle to international and non-govern-
 mental investigations of alleged human rights violations.
 The government, however, has expressed publicly its
 concern that allegations of human rights violations
 can lead to unwarranted interference in the internal
 affairs of sovereign states and that investigations
 of such allegations can be used by the strong to apply
 pressure on the weak. The government does not support
 the use of any non-economic criteria in the consideration
 of loan or other asistance requests by international
 financial institutions and organizations. Trinidad
 
 
 542
 and Tobago has never been the subject of international
 or non-governmental investigations in the human rights
 field. Several human rights organizations operate
 freely and openly in the country, educating the public,
 calling attention to alleged shortcomings and violations,
 and advocating a more equitable distribution of the
 fruits of prosperity. A constitutionally mandated
 ombudsman investigates allegations by citizens that
 their rights have been violated by government agencies.
