CUBA
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
The Cuban government’s intolerance of democracy and free expression
remained unique in the region.A one-party state,Cuba restricted nearly all avenues
of political dissent. Although dissidents occasionally faced criminal prosecution,
the government relied more frequently on short-term detentions, house arrest,
travel restrictions, threats, surveillance, politically-motivated dismissals from
employment, and other forms of harassment.
Cuba’s restrictions on human rights were undergirded by the country’s legal and
institutional structure. The rights to freedom of expression, association, assembly,
movement, and of the press were strictly limited under Cuban law. By criminalizing
enemy propaganda, the spreading of “unauthorized news,” and insult to patriotic
symbols, the government curbed freedom of speech under the guise of
protecting state security. The authorities also imprisoned or ordered the surveillance
of individuals who had committed no illegal act, relying upon laws penalizing
“dangerousness” (estado peligroso) and allowing for “official warning”
(advertencia oficial). The government-controlled courts undermined the right to
fair trial by restricting the right to a defense, and frequently failed to observe the few
due process rights available to defendants under domestic law.
In July, the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation
(Comisión Cubana de Derechos Humanos y Reconciliación Nacional), a respected
Havana-based nongovernmental group, released a partial list of political prisoners
that included 246 cases they considered to be reliably documented. Some of the
prisoners named on the list were serving extremely long sentences—twenty or
more years for crimes such as “rebellion” and “sabotage,” offenses broadly defined
by Cuban courts—while others were serving short sentences for “contempt of
authority” (desacato) or public disorder.
The government continued to prosecute people for “illegal exit” if they attempted to leave the island without first obtaining official permission to do so.
Such permission was sometimes denied arbitrarily, or made contingent on the purchase
of an expensive exit permit. In June, Pedro Riera Escalante, a former Cuban
consul and intelligence officer in Mexico City, was sentenced by a military court to
six years in prison for leaving Cuba illegally, using false documents, and bribing
officials to allow his departure. Riera Escalante had broken with his government
and sought political asylum in Mexico, but he was forcibly deported by the Mexican
authorities in October.
Even though his three co-defendants were released in May 2000, dissident leader
Vladimiro Roca Antúnez remained incarcerated as of November, serving his last
year of a five-year sentence. The four, then members of the Internal Dissidents
Working Group (Grupo de Trabajo de la Disidencia Interna, GTDI), were convicted
of “acts against the security of the state” in March 1999, after having been
detained since July 1997. Their detention followed the GTDI’s release of an analytical
paper on the Cuban economy, human rights, and democracy.
Another prominent activist who was still behind bars as of November was
thirty-nine-year-old Dr. Oscar Elías Biscet González. Biscet received a three-year
prison sentence in February 2000 for protests that included turning the Cuban flag
upside-down and carrying anti-abortion placards. The president of the Lawton
Human Rights Foundation, an independent organization, Biscet was convicted of
dishonoring patriotic symbols, public disorder, and instigating delinquency. In
detention since November 1999, he had reportedly been mistreated by prison
authorities and kept in poor conditions, causing weight loss and dental problems.
In April, Biscet was reportedly made to share a cell with a mentally disordered
inmate.
José Orlando González Bridon, leader of the Confederation of Democratic
Workers of Cuba, an unofficial union, was sentenced to two years of imprisonment
in May for “spreading false news.” The charges stemmed from an article he published
on an Internet site in August 2000 that criticized local police for negligence
in the death of another labor rights activist. In November 2000, shortly before he
was detained, González Bridon took part in a protest rally in which he and other
dissidents chanted “Down with Fidel!” as they symbolically buried the Cuban constitution
and penal code in small coffins. Prosecutors had originally requested a
seven-year sentence for González Bridon. Although they reduced their petition to
one year, the trial court added a year to the sentence after finding him guilty. Later,
on appeal, the sentence was cut back to a year. González Bridon was released on
conditional liberty on November 22, three weeks before the expiration of his sentence.
(Cuban law allows for conditional liberty contingent on good behavior after
half of a prisoner’s sentence has been served.)
Another person who left prison slightly early was Julia Cecilia Delgado, released
on October 19. Delgado, an independent librarian and president of a nongovernmental
group, had been serving a one-year sentence for “disrespect.”Delgado was
one of about two hundred people who were detained in early December 2000, in a
wave of arrests probably meant to discourage public gatherings on December 10,
International Human Rights Day. Pro-democracy activist Angel Moya Acosta,
prosecuted at the same time, was believed to be finishing his one-year sentence in
December.
Cecilio Monteagudo Sánchez, a member of the unofficial Democratic Solidarity
Party (Partido Solidaridad Democrática), was released from prison in June. He
had been convicted of “enemy propaganda” and sentenced to four years of imprisonment
in 1998. Cuban police originally detained him in September 1997, after
he had drafted, but not published, a document calling for abstention from local
elections.
Much more frequent than actual criminal prosecutions were arrests and shortterm
detentions. The most prominent case began on January 12, when Czech citizens
Jan Bubenik and Ivan Pilip were detained after meeting with independent
Cuban journalists in the province of Ciego de Avila. Bubenik, a former student
activist, and Pilip, a legislator and former Czech government finance minister,were
held for nearly four weeks, as the Cuban authorities considered prosecuting them
on charges of acting against state security. The two were released in early February
after intensive diplomatic efforts by European officials.
A blind dissident, Juan Carlos Gonzalez Leyva, was reportedly stopped and
roughed up by members of the Cuban secret police on January 16, along with two
of his colleagues.Over the course of the year, dozens of other dissidents and human
rights activists reported being arrested and detained for brief periods, such as a few
hours or overnight. On some occasions, detainees were threatened or insulted, or
their homes were searched.
Whether detained for political or common crimes, inmates were subjected to
abusive prison conditions. Prisoners frequently suffered malnourishment and languished
in overcrowded cells without appropriate medical attention. Some
endured physical and sexual abuse, typically by other inmates with the acquiescence
of guards, or long periods in punitive isolation cells. Prison authorities
insisted that all detainees participate in politically oriented “re-education” sessions
or face punishment. Political prisoners who denounced the poor conditions of
imprisonment were frequently punished with solitary confinement, restricted visits,
or denial of medical treatment.
Cuba maintained the death penalty for a large number of offences. In June, Justice
Minister Roberto Diaz Sotolongo said that “for humanitarian reasons” Cuba
preferred not to employ capital punishment, but that the penalty served as a warning
to drug traffickers. Penal code changes dating from the late 1990s had extended
capital punishment to cases of drug trafficking with aggravating circumstances.
In April, Elizardo Sánchez of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and
National Reconciliation announced that the death penalty had not been applied in
Cuba over the past year. “We are seeing a moratorium on the death penalty, but we
should move on to its abolition,” Sánchez reportedly explained. Two Salvadorans
convicted of taking part in a wave of bombings of tourist installations in Havana
were on death row, having been confined there since 1998. Some twenty other prisoners
were also reportedly on death row, although this could not be verified as the
authorities did not provide public information on death sentences and executions.
The authorities maintained strict controls on the press, barring local independent
news coverage and taking steps to limit foreign reporting. As of November,
independent journalist Bernardo Arévalo Padrón, director of the news agency
Linea Sur Press, remained behind bars, having been denied conditional release.He
was serving a six-year sentence for “insulting” President Castro, imposed in November 1997. In January, independent journalist Jesús Joel Díaz Hernández,
who had been serving a four-year sentence for “dangerousness,” was granted conditional
release.
The authorities routinely detained and questioned independent journalists,
monitored their telephone calls and visitors, restricted their travel, and put them
under house arrest to prevent coverage of certain events. In May, in recognition of
such tactics, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a U.S.-based press freedom
group, named President Fidel Castro as one of the Ten Worst Enemies of the
Press for 2001.
To prevent negative foreign media coverage, Cuban authorities continued to
deny visas to certain disfavored foreign journalists. In January, President Castro
accused some reporters of “transmitting insults and lies,” suggesting that Cuba
might consider canceling their employers’ license to operate in Cuba.“We have tolerated
for years reporters who intentionally and deliberately insult the leaders of
the revolution and me,”Castro said.
The government maintained considerable control over religious expression, but
in general religious institutions and their leaders enjoyed a degree of autonomy not
permitted other bodies. Several religious-run groups distributed humanitarian aid
and carried out social programs.Yet the government continued to slow the entry of
foreign priests and nuns and to bar religious institutions from running schools
(although religious instruction was allowed). In contrast to the first decades after
the Cuban Revolution, discrimination against overtly religious persons was rare.
The government recognized only one labor union, the Worker’s Central of Cuba
(Central de Trabajadores de Cuba, CTC). Independent labor unions were denied
formal status and their members were harassed.Workers employed in businesses
backed by foreign investment remained under tight government control. Under
restrictive labor laws, the authorities had a prominent role in the selection, payment,
and dismissal of workers, effectively denying workers the right to bargain
directly with employers over benefits, promotions, and wages.Cuba also continued
to use prison labor for agricultural camps and ran clothing assembly and other factories
in its prisons. The authorities’ insistence that political prisoners work without
pay in poor conditions violated international labor standards.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Human rights defenders were systematically harassed.The authorities routinely
used surveillance, phone tapping, and intimidation in its efforts to restrict independent
monitoring of the government’s human rights practices. In some
instances, they employed arbitrary searches, short-term arrests, evictions, travel
restrictions, politically-motivated dismissals from employment, threats and other
forms of harassment against local activists.
Although the U.N. special rapporteur on violence against women was permitted
to visit in 1999, the government generally barred international human rights and
humanitarian monitors from the country.The International Committee of the Red
Cross (ICRC) has not been allowed to conduct prison visits in Cuba since 1989,
making Cuba the only country in the region to deny the organization such access.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
At its fifty-seventh session in April, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights
passed a resolution expressing concern about continuing human rights violations
in Cuba, the ninth such resolution passed since 1991, and urged the government to
invite the U.N. special rapporteurs on torture and on freedom of expression to visit
the country.
In the resolution, the Commission noted that Cuba had made “no satisfactory
improvements” in the area of human rights. It expressed particular concern at the
“continued repression of members of the political opposition,” as well as about the
“detention of dissidents and all other persons detained or imprisoned for peacefully
expressing their political, religious and social views and for exercising their
right to full and equal participation in public affairs.”An early draft of the resolution
criticized the U.S. economic embargo on Cuba, but that language was omitted
from the final version.
The resolution, which was sponsored by the Czech Republic, passed by a 22-20
vote, with a number of abstentions.
European Union
Cuba remained the only Latin American country that did not have a cooperation
agreement with the European Union. The E.U. “common position” on Cuba,
adopted in 1996 and extended in June 2001, made full economic cooperation conditional
on reforms toward greater democracy and human rights protection. A
number of E.U. members, however, were in favor of revisiting the common position
and establishing closer ties with Cuba free of any conditions. Already, European
countries accounted for almost half of Cuba’s foreign trade, and more than
180 European companies operated on the island.
Visiting Brussels in July, Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Pérez Roque appealed
for a review of E.U. policy toward Cuba. A few months later, E.U. officials
announced that the European Union favored resuming the political dialogue with
Cuba and permitting the island to join the Cotonou Agreement,which governs the
E.U.’s aid relationships with African, Caribbean, and Pacific states. Belgian Foreign
Minister Louis Michel, holding the rotating presidency of the E.U.Council, had visited
Havana in August, meeting with high Cuban officials as well as political dissidents.
On returning to Europe, he expressed support for strengthening contacts
with Cuba. Political talks between the European Union and Cuba were scheduled
to take place at the end of November.
In early October, Cuban exiles filed a lawsuit in Brussels against President Fidel
Castro and other high Cuban officials under a law that empowers Belgian courts to
hear cases of genocide and crimes against humanity, regardless of where the incidents
occurred. The lead plaintiff in the case was José Basulto, president of the
Miami-based group Brothers to the Rescue.Another plaintiff was Eugenio de Sosa
Chabau, a former newspaper editor who spent twenty years in prison after the
Cuban Revolution. The complaint described torture and other abuses suffered by political prisoners, including a 1960 incident in which a prisoner allegedly received
electric shocks to his head and testicles.
Latin America and
the Organization of American States (OAS)
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez remained Cuba’s most reliable ally in the
region,with his country being the only one in Latin American (besides Cuba itself)
to vote against the U.N. resolution on Cuba’s human rights conditions. Several
other countries in the region abstained from the vote, while four—Argentina,
Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Uruguay—voted in favor of the resolution.
Cuba reacted strongly to the U.N. vote, lashing out at the Latin American countries
that voted for the censure. In February, prior to the Geneva session, Cuba’s
official daily Granma accused Argentina of seeking U.S. economic assistance in
exchange for voting against Cuba at the United Nations. President Castro accused
Argentine President Fernando de la Rúa of “licking the Yankees’ boots,” leading
Argentina to temporarily withdraw its ambassador from Cuba. After the Geneva
vote, Castro again attacked Argentina and described Costa Rica as playing the role
of “a lackey—something more than a lackey—a servant” of the United States. He
also claimed that Guatemala only went along with the vote because of heavy U.S.
pressure.
The latter part of the year saw movement toward eliminating the last vestiges of
Cuba’s diplomatic isolation in the region. In September,Honduras opened an interests
section in Havana, a likely first step toward full diplomatic relations. The Honduran
move left El Salvador as the only Latin American country with no diplomatic
relations with the island.Cuba’s diplomatic estrangement from other Latin American
states dated from 1961, when the Organization of American States suspended
its membership. In August, in a speech before the OAS Permanent Council,
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Luis Alfonso Davila pointedly called for the “complete
integration” of the hemisphere, arguing that no country should be isolated.
United States
The devastation wrought by Hurricane Michelle opened a crack in the U.S. economic
embargo on Cuba, with U.S. companies selling food and medicine to
Havana in November 2001 to offset losses and replenish stocks used in the island’s
worst storm in half a century. The sales, valued by a U.S. official at about U.S. $30
million, represented the first commercial transactions between the two countries
since the embargo was put in place. Authorities in Washington had originally
offered to provide Cuba with disaster relief aid, but Cuban officials, declining the
aid offer, expressed interest in buying food, medicine, and other necessities.
A law enacted in 2000 allowed food sales to Cuba, and an earlier law allowed the
export of medicines. Yet, because the law on food sales barred U.S. government or
private financing of the sales, Cuban officials had previously criticized it, saying
that they would refrain from buying food until the embargo was lifted. This year’s
purchase represented a departure from that position, but one that Cuban officials insisted was exceptional. “We have no reason to see [the sales] as a policy shift,
rather as something that happened because of a hurricane that doesn’t happen
every month in Cuba,” explained Cuban Vice-President Carlos Lage.
In May, Senator Jesse Helms and Senator Joseph Lieberman introduced draft
legislation in Congress to allocate up to $100 million over four years to assist dissidents,
opposition groups, political prisoners, and other nongovernmental voices in
Cuba. The bill, known as the Cuban Solidarity Act of 2001, was criticized by some
of its potential beneficiaries, who feared that receiving U.S. government aid would
damage their credibility and help discredit their views. A parallel bill had been
introduced in the House in March. Both versions of the draft legislation were still
under review by congressional committees as of November.
A Cuban émigré, Eriberto Mederos, faced denaturalization proceedings in
Florida at the end of the year. Mederos could be stripped of his U.S. citizenship
because of allegations by another Cuban-American who accused Mederos of torturing
him when he was a political prisoner in Cuba in the 1960s.According to the
former prisoner,Mederos subjected him to painful electrical shock treatments that
lacked any medical justification.
