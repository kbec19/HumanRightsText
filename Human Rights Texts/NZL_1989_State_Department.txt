 NEW ZEALAND
 New Zealand is a parliamentary democracy, with executive
 authority vested in a 20-member cabinet led by a prime
 minister. The 97 members of the unicameral legislature
 include 4, elected by those membersï¿½ of the native Maori
 min6rity who wish to be included on a separate electoral roll.
 Maori comprise approximately 9 percent Of New Zealand's
 9Qpulation of 3,372,000, while other Pacific islanders total
 about 3 percent. ,The rights of the native Maori minority have
 been the. subject of increasing public attention in recent
 years, particuiarly as the country prepares to commemorate 150
 years of European settlement in 1990. The Department of Maori
 Affairs is being phased out in favor of the Iwi Transition
 Agency, charged with overseeing the devolution of
 responsibility for Maori interests to Iwi (tribal)
 authorities.;
 Niue and the Cook Islands are self-governing countries in free
 association with New Zealand. The island group of Tokelau is
 administered by New Zealand with limited but growing self-
 government. Inhabitants of all three hold local and New
 Zealand citizenship, and local law is compatible with New
 Zealand and British common law.
 The police and defense forces are responsible to and firmly
 controlled by civilian officials.
 Realahnual economic growth-has been low or negative in recent
 years. However, the free enterprise economy affords the
 opportunity for a reasonable standard of living for most New
 Zealanders. Education is freely available to all.
 New Zealand. continued its excellent record in human rights
 during 1989. New Zealanders enjoy personal freedom, freedom
 of religion, freedom of the press, universal suffrage, and the
 rule of law. Respect for minority rights, concern for the
 economically deprived, and the humane treatment of prisoners
 are established in principle and in practice.

 cannot afford to pay for a private attorney. Preventive
 detention is prohibited.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial

 the accused are carefully observed and subject to public
 scrutiny. The judiciary operates independently of executive
 or legislative influence.

 not violate a person's privacy, the sanctity of the home, or
 the integrity of correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are assured by law and respected
 in practice. More than 150 newspapers and 600 magazines are
 published throughout the country, reflecting a wide spectrum
 of political and social thought. The Government makes no
 attempt to censor the press, and opposition viewpoints are
 freely expressed.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Rights to peaceful assembly and association are recognized and
 respected.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.

 resources, New Zealand accepts and resettles refugees and
 asylum seekers.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The people freely elect their government. Two major parties,
 Labour and National, dominate the political scene and have
 formed governments chosen in triennial elections for more than
 50 years. Smaller parties and groups are usually of little
 consequence in the national electoral process. New Zealand
 law provides for universal suffrage; citizens are eligible to
 vote at age 18. No restrictions based upon race, sex, creed,
 or national origin limit participation in the political
 process. Women and Maoris, as well as other minorities,

 NEW ZEALAND
 regularly serve in Parliament and the Cabinet albeit in
 numbers welr below-their propotion of the population. Voting
 rates are high, and participation in political groups is
 common. Opposition groups freely voice their views.
 Section 4 *Governmenta'l Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 New Zealand's commitment to human rights is clearly
 demonstrated by th4"active efforts of local, national, and
 internationaf bodies organized to protect human rights and
 revent discrimination. The official Net: Zealand Human Rights
 Commission and the New Zealand Council for Civil Liberties are
 joined by such nongovernmental human rights organizations as
 the pitizens Association for Racial Equality, the New Zealand
 chapter of the International Commission of Jurists, the Race
 Relations Conciliator, Amnesty International, and the National
 Organization of Women. In May 1989, the Government sponsored
 an international human rights conference in Wellington which,
 while noting New Zealand's excellent human rights record,
 urged the Government to do more to promote the rights of the
 Ma ri and Pacific island minorities within the country.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Despite the historical absence of overt discrimination and the
 achievements and status of many successful Maori in government
 and public life, some of the indigenous'population remain
 marginally educated and economically disadvantaged.
 Increasing urbanization (approximnately 90 percent of young
 Maori live in cities) and continued assimilation with New
 Zealanders of European descent have created social stress
 which is reflected in social indicators. A relatively high
 percentage of Maori are unemployed and receive state
 assistande. They figure disproportionately in crime
 statistics and among the prison population.
 Maori activists continue to press for the return of
 government-held land and assets to Maori tribes in accordance
 with the terms Of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi. Legislation
 reallocating fishing quotas to Maori tribes in accordance with
 the Treaty underwent several revisions in 1989. At year's end
 that legislation was before a parliamentary select committee.
 Numerous other claims are currently under investigation, and
 sales of several state assets have been held up pending a
 review of the effect of the sales on MaoTi rights and
 interests. Some Maori activists have called for a boycott of
 cerpmonies comm&morating the sesquicentennial of the Treaty on
 the grounds that the Government has not honored its terms.
 The Government established a Ministry of Women's Affairs in
 1985 and has ratified the U.N. Convention for the Elimination
 of all.Forms of Discrimination Against Women. A Human Rights
 Commission'established in 1977 hears complaints about sex
 discrimination, most fre quently concerning wage inequities.
 The Government has promised that "comparable worth"
 legislation will be introduced during the current term of,
 .Parliament. The Government has funded shelters and other
 assistance for victims of domestic violence and has prosecuted
 offenders.
 Violence against women has received increased public and
 governmental attention in recent years. The Crimes Amendment
 
 
 942
 NEZEALAND
 Act of 1986 eliminated the crime of rape, replacing it with
 the crimes of sexual violation and unlawful sexual
 connection. The new law al-so increased protection for the
 victim during trial by allowing suppression of the victim's
 name and other-details, and eliminated the exemption for
 spousal rape. In 1987 the police changed their policy on
 family violence, requiring that arrests be made instead of
 attempting mediation at the scene by police officers not
 trained for that role. Women have become increasingly
 cognizant of their legal rights as evidenced by the number of
 claims to the Accident Compensation Corporation for "loss of
 the capacity for enjoyment of life." In 1981 there were three
 such claims based on sexual abuse. In 1988 there were 1,500.
 Services for victims are rapidly increasing as well; in
 1987-88, 76 rape and sexual abuse counseling organizations
 were funded by the Department of Social Welfare, up from 48
 the year before.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 New Zealand workers have unrestricted rights to establish and
 join organizations of their own choosing and to affiliate
 those-organizations with other unions and international
 organizations. Their unions are protected from interference,
 suspension, and dissolution by the Government and, in fact,
 have considerable influence on legislation and government
 policy. Unions have-the right to strike. Public sector
 unions, however, are precluded from striking if work stoppages
 pose a threat to public safety. Unions freely maintain
 relations with international bodies and participate in
 bilateral exchanges.
 For the past 2 years, the Committee on Freedom of Association
 (CFA) of the International Labor Organization has examined a
 complaint from the New Zealand Employers' Federation that the
 1987 Labor Relations Act restricts freedom of association by
 requiring- that unions must have 1,000 members to be officially
 registened. Noting that although unregistered unions are
 legal, official unions have broader rights, the CFA has
 requested the Government to reexamine the system established
 under the 1987 Act.
 b. The.Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right of labor unions-to organize and bargain collectively
 is provided by law.- Unions actively recruit members and
 engage in collective bargaining. Sixty-four percent of wage
 earners are represented by unions. New Zealand unions operate
 under a closed shop system where union membership is
 compulsory if the majority of workers in a workplace vote in
 favor of union coverage.
 Mediation and arbitration procedures are independent of
 government control. A system of labor courts hears cases
 arising from disputes over interpretation of labor laws. In
 addition, the Arbitration Commission and the Mediation Service
 are available to handle wage disputes and assist in
 maintaining effective labor relations. Labor laws are applied
 uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 All New Zealand workers are protected from forced or
 compulsory labor by law and in practice.

 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children under the age of 16 may not be employed without
 special government -approval and 'must not work between the
 hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. These laws are effectively
 enforced.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 New Zealand enforces a 40-hour workweek, a minimum of 3 weeks,
 annual paid vacation for all employees, and observance of 11
 paid public holidays. The hourly minimum wage of $3.50 is
 adequate to provide a decent standard of living. In most
 cases, minimum wage recipients also receive a variety of
 welfare payments. Most workdrs earn more than the minimum
 wage.
 New Zealand has an extensive body of law and regulations
 governing health and safety issues. Rules are enforced by
 Department of Labor inspectors who have the power to shut down
 equipment if necessary, and unions may file safety complaints
 on behalf of workers.
