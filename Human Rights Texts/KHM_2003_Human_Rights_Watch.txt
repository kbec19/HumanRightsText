CAMBODIA
Cambodia largely failed to meet its obligations to promote human rights in
2002. Local elections, held in February,were marred by killings and intimidation
of political opposition members and others, and subsequent continuing
violence offered a worrying prognosis for national elections in 2003. Opposition
newspapers were increasingly subject to threats, closure, and arrests of staff.At this
writing, there had been little progress in negotiations to establish a tribunal for former
Khmer Rouge leaders. The judicial system remained extremely weak and generally
unable to deliver justice to those whose human rights were violated, albeit
efforts were made to prosecute security officials accused of torturing detainees.
Prison conditions remained poor. Cambodia deported to Vietnam hundreds of
asylum seekers fleeing persecution of indigenous minorities there, in violation of
its obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention. The government failed to adequately
address trafficking in people.Many Cambodians suffered from poor education
and health services and insecurity of land tenure. There was some progress
in the field of labor rights, and environmentalists strengthened advocacy efforts on
behalf of Cambodia’s rural poor.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Cambodia in February held its first local elections in more than thirty years, to
elect leaders for the country’s 1,621 communes (administrative units consisting of
four to seven villages). The Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) consolidated its grip
on power by taking control of 99 percent of the commune councils. There were
numerous instances of violence, intimidation, vote-buying, and voter coercion,
although at a lower level than during the 1998 national elections. Fifteen prospective
candidates and activists of the political opposition Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) and
the United National Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful and Cooperative
Cambodia (FUNCINPEC), as well as the two-year-old son of a CPP candidate,
were killed between January 2001 and polling day. A local election observer was
killed two days before the election.
Political violence continued in the aftermath of the commune elections and as
the country prepared for national elections, scheduled for July 2003.The mutilated
body of Kork Khom, a SRP activist from Takeo, was found in a rice field in July.
Some of his fingers and part of his left ear had been cut off, his leg was broken, and
numerous bruises marked his body. By November 2002, another six SRP and
FUNCINPEC activists had been murdered. In October, just before Senator Kem
Sokha resigned from the FUNCINPEC party, he sustained injuries in a car accident
that appeared to have been deliberately staged to warn or harm him.
In contrast to 1998, when no one was held accountable for election violence, in
2002 authorities arrested several people suspected of political killings. In ten of
twenty-four cases, provincial courts convicted defendants. In a move to appease donors, the Ministry of Interior pressured court officials to speed up trials in some
of these murder cases. As a result, legal observers found that some of the accused
were convicted based on insufficient evidence.
The National Election Committee (NEC), commissioned to organize, oversee,
and monitor the election process, failed to use its authority to implement any of the
penalty provisions in the Election Law in response to acts of bribery, violence, or
intimidation. Fair access to the media for parties other than the CPP was also
denied during the campaign.Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) involved in
election monitoring called for reform of the NEC, which was criticized as lacking
independence. In August the National Assembly passed a law empowering the Ministry
of Interior—rather than an independent recruitment committee advocated
by NGOs—to nominate NEC members.
Freedom of expression in political debate was dealt a blow in December 2001,
when Senators Chhang Song, Siphan Phay and Pou Savath were expelled by the
CPP after they expressed opinions differing from the party line during debate. Electronic
media remained under the control of persons and companies affiliated with
the CPP. The independent press affiliated with the political opposition was subject
to threats, closure and lawsuits. In April, the Phnom Penh court convicted the SRPaffiliated
newspaper Samleng Yuvachun Khmer (Voice of Khmer Youth) of defamation
and printing false information, and ordered it to pay 71 million riel
(approximately U.S.$18,000).The paper had published an article accusing two military
generals and businessman Mong Reththy, a close ally of Prime Minister Hun
Sen, of illegal logging. After the newspaper appealed the decision, Mong Reththy
and the generals agreed to drop the complaint.
In July, Sok Sothea, a reporter for the opposition Moneaksekar Khmer (Khmer
Conscience) newspaper was detained for several hours at the Ministry of Interior
after he shared a leaked document from the co-minister of interior with another
paper, which published the document. In August, the Ministry of Information
ordered the thirty-day suspension of Moneaksekar Khmer for publishing an article
that allegedly affected “national security.” The English-language Cambodia Daily
newspaper was threatened with suspension when it called January 7—the day that
the Khmer Rouge were defeated by Vietnamese troops in 1979—“Vietnamese Liberation
Day.”The Ministry of Information later dropped the fifteen-day suspension
order.
In September, the editor and a reporter from Chakraval (Universe) newspaper
were arrested, allegedly without warrants, and detained overnight after a complaint
by the director-general of the National Police. The pro-government paper had
reported about the confiscation by customs officials of a car purchased by the complainant,
as well as subsequent telephone threats made against the officials.The two
men were released, reportedly after an order from the prime minister. In October,
the Ministry of Information ordered the independent radio station Sambok Kmum
(Beehive) to stop broadcasting reports from the Voice of America and Radio Free
Asia.
Two Cambodian writers, Vann Nath and Moeun Chhean Nariddh, received
Hellman/Hammett awards from Human Rights Watch in 2002 in recognition of
the courage with which they have written about human rights.
The Cambodian government created a military anti-terrorism unit, reportedly to provide protection during November meetings in Phnom Penh of leaders of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The soldiers belonged to Battalion
911, which, according to the U.N., was implicated in killings, illegal detention,
and torture of FUNCINPEC soldiers after the 1997 coup by Hun Sen, then second
prime minister. In October, thirty high-ranking police officers completed a threemonth
training on fighting terrorism, conducted in Vietnam.
In February, United Nations (U.N.) Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced
the withdrawal of the U.N. from further discussions with the Cambodian government
over the establishment of a tribunal to bring to justice former leaders of
Democratic Kampuchea (Khmer Rouge). According to the U.N., the Cambodian
law establishing the tribunal was unable to guarantee the necessary independence,
impartiality, and objectivity.The U.N. had insisted that the tribunal be governed by
a memorandum between the U.N. and Cambodia, rather than the Cambodian law
adopted in August 2001.
Cambodian and international human rights groups supported the U.N. decision,
but stressed the need for accountability for grave human rights violations
committed by the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979. In July,Hun Sen expressed willingness
to make amendments to the law. In August, Annan announced that he
needed a clear mandate from either the U.N. General Assembly or the Security
Council to resume negotiations, and that the Cambodian government was to seek
the support of the member states to initiate action either within the Security Council
or the General Assembly. In November, the General Assembly’s Third Committee
passed a resolution initiated by Japan, calling for the secretary-general to
resume negotiations with Cambodia on the “mixed tribunal” formulation, which
Cambodian and international human rights groups have criticized for falling far
short of internationally recognized standards.
Meanwhile, three former Khmer Rouge leaders—Ieng Sary, Khieu Samphan
and Nuon Chea—continued to live freely in Cambodia. The Phnom Penh military
court extended the pre-trial detention of Khmer Rouge military leader Chhit
Choeun (Ta Mok), and former S-21 (Tuol Sleng) prison director Kaing Khek Iev
(Duch), by adding charges of crimes against humanity. Both were initially arrested
in 1999.
Cambodia ratified the International Criminal Court treaty, thereby accepting
the court’s jurisdiction beginning July 1.
The trials during the year of around fifty persons accused of involvement with
the Cambodian Freedom Fighters (CFF), a group that claimed responsibility for
violent attacks in Phnom Penh in November 2000, demonstrated serious shortcomings.
Defendants were arrested without warrants, and denied a prompt trial.
One lawyer represented eighteen suspects, who gave testimonies incriminating
each other, making a proper defense for each of them impossible.The judge denied
requests by some of the defendants’ lawyers to summon witnesses, and ignored
claims by the accused of physical or mental pressure during interrogation. A highranking
military intelligence official, summoned by the court after one of the
defendants claimed the official had hired him to infiltrate the CFF, failed to appear.
Most of the accused were convicted and sentenced to terms varying from suspended
sentences to life imprisonment.
Plans for legal and judicial reform stalled. Less than 1 percent of the national budget was allocated to the justice sector, undermining the judicial system’s effectiveness.
A long overdue Statute for Judges, which includes a code of conduct, had
still not been adopted as of November.The Supreme Council ofMagistracy, a body
commissioned to oversee the functioning of the judiciary and guarantee its independence,
itself lacked independence.
Lacking faith in the judicial system, villagers often resorted to summary justice
by beating and killing people suspected of committing crimes. Local human rights
groups and the U.N. recorded sixty-eight incidents of mob violence from mid-1999
to August 2002.While police intervention saved some lives, they frequently refused
to act or were complicit in the violence. Only two persons served prison terms for
their involvement in a mob killing, after convictions by the Phnom Penh court in a
September trial.
Torture by security officials of detainees continued to be a problem. The criminal
procedure code was amended in November 2001 to extend the maximum
period in police detention—the time when torture commonly is used by police to
extract confessions—from forty-eight to seventy-two hours. Five guards accused of
torturing prisoners were acquitted in August by a Kompong Cham provincial court
despite witnesses, one of them a prison guard, and medical records corroborating
the torture.Without clarifying his decision, the judge found the five prison guards
not guilty of torture, but ordered administrative action, acknowledging that the
guards had been at fault. A more positive ruling came in April, when a Svay Rieng
provincial court sentenced three policemen to suspended prison terms for torture.
In many of Cambodia’s prisons overcrowding, unhygienic conditions, inadequate
food, and excessive pre-trial detention continued to be reported. In three prisons,
shackles were used to restrain prisoners.
In January,Cambodia,Vietnam, and the U.N.High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) signed a tripartite agreement on the voluntary, U.N.-monitored repatriation
of approximately one thousand asylum seekers from the Central Highlands
of Vietnam (Montagnards) who were sheltered at two UNHCR sites in Mondolkiri
and Ratanakiri provinces. The agreement crumbled in March after Vietnamese
officials barred UNHCR monitoring teams from the Central Highlands.On March
21, refugees and UNHCR staff were threatened and attacked when a delegation of
more than four hundred people, including as many as one hundred Vietnamese
government agents, overran Mondolkiri camp and conducted house-to-house
searches of the refugees’ huts.
At the end of March, in violation of the 1951 Refugee Convention, the Cambodian
government announced that any new Montagnard asylum seekers would be
considered illegal migrants and summarily deported without being given an
opportunity to claim asylum. More than four hundred Montagnards were
deported to Vietnam during April and May. In mid-April, UNHCR’s two provincial
refugee camps were closed, and their nine hundred residents transported to
Phnom Penh,where they were processed for resettlement to the United States. The
first group of Montagnard refugees left for the U.S. in June.
On July 25, Thich Tri Luc, a Vietnamese monk belonging to the banned Unified
Buddhist Church, disappeared in Phnom Penh after being granted refugee status by
UNHCR. As of November, Cambodian authorities had not responded to requests
by human rights groups for information on his whereabouts. In August, Cambodian authorities arrested and deported Guojun Li and his wife, Zhang Xinji, two
Falun Gong members under the protection of UNHCR, to China.
SRP member Sok Yoeun remained in detention in Thailand since his arrest in
December 1999 for illegal immigration,while hearings continued into the Cambodian
government’s request for his extradition as a suspect in a 1998 rocket attack on
a motorcade carrying Hun Sen. This was despite an apparent lack of evidence linking
Sok Yoeun to the attack, and also despite his having been under the protection
of UNHCR since shortly after his escape to Thailand in 1999.
Trafficking of human beings to, within, and from Cambodia, for purposes of
forced labor including prostitution,begging, and adoption remained a major problem.
In some cases, suspected traffickers were arrested. However, in several
instances trafficking victims were arrested and subsequently deported to Vietnam
on charges of illegal immigration. In August, the Phnom Penh court convicted ten
Vietnamese girls, most of them minors, who allegedly had been trafficked into
prostitution in a Phnom Penh brothel. The girls were sentenced to two to three
months in prison for illegal immigration.
In January, Cambodia ratified the optional protocol to the Convention on the
Rights of the Child (CRC) on the sale of children, child prostitution, and child
pornography. It also ratified the optional protocol to the CRC on the involvement
of children in armed conflict.
Labor conditions improved in some workplaces, due to the strengthened capacity
of labor unions, improved relations with factory management, and intensive
monitoring in many of Cambodia’s garment factories by the International Labour
Organization.Problems remained with pay, forced overtime, and discrimination of
workers who joined labor unions. In September, the Phnom Penh Appeals Court
overturned a ruling by the Kompong Speu court ordering the reinstatement of
seven workers who had been fired after organizing union activity. Khim Sam On
and Sok Bona, leaders of the Cambodian Federation of Independent Trade Unions,
who were arrested on July 15 allegedly for inciting violence at a Phnom Penh factory
in 2001, remained in detention as of November 2002, despite being cleared of
charges by the Ministry of Labor.
Implementation of the second phase of Cambodia’s “Demobilization and Reintegration
Project” was delayed after concerns about the project’s first phase
prompted the World Bank to call for a thorough evaluation. The U.S.$42 million
pilot project, largely funded by the World Bank and Japan, was aimed at downsizing
and disarming the military and cutting the military’s budget. The project was
hampered by divergent estimates of the size of the armed forces, with credible
reports that thousands of “ghost soldiers”were collecting compensation packages.
The government allocated more money for education and health in 2002, but
delays in disbursement of education funds meant that teachers were not paid and
students had to pay unofficial fees to their teachers. Slow disbursement of funds to
the health sector coupled with low wages for health personnel meant that many
Cambodians lacked access to adequate health care. In June, the National Assembly
passed a law on the prevention and control of the spread of HIV/AIDS, criminalizing
discrimination against people living with the disease.
Insecurity of land tenure contributed to landgrabbing, often by soldiers or companies with connections to local officials. Legal Aid of Cambodia represented more
than eight thousand families, or about forty-three thousand people, in land cases,
most of which involved military and local officials. In a significant case that was first
brought to court in March 2001, indigenous villagers in Ratanakiri province
launched a legal appeal against a military general who fraudulently obtained title to
their ancestral lands, putting some nine hundred villagers at risk of landlessness. In
March 2002,Hun Sen instructed the Ministry of Land Management to purchase the
land from the general and return it to the villagers, in exchange for the villagers
dropping their lawsuit.
While some steps were taken during the year to protect Cambodia’s natural
resources, environmental degradation remained a serious concern. Activists welcomed
a logging moratorium put into effect in January, and the government’s cancellation
of two Malaysian-owned concessions for illegal logging in June. Despite
these measures, extensive small- and medium-scale logging continued throughout
the year, and law enforcement in the forestry sector remained poor. There were
numerous reports of intimidation by concessionaires to stop local villagers from
accessing forests. In June, security guards of the Tomring rubber plantation company
in Kompong Thom province fired shots to intimidate local villagers attempting
to prevent the company from further clearing trees they used to collect resin.
Environmental groups expressed concerns about a Forestry Law passed by the
National Assembly in July, which lacked guarantees for local communities to continue
using non-timber forest products such as resin and rattan to sustain their
livelihoods.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Dozens of Cambodian human rights groups operated in the country, conducting
advocacy, training, and monitoring activities, counseling victims, and providing
legal services to Cambodia’s poor. There was ongoing violence, threats and
intimidation against human rights defenders in 2002.
In several cases, criminal proceedings that appeared to be without foundation
were initiated against human rights groups in an apparent attempt to intimidate
them. In February, the Phnom Penh court dropped criminal charges filed against
the deputy director of the League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights
(Licadho). These charges had been sought by the adoptive parents of a seven-yearold
girl, angered by Licadho’s request to local authorities to act to stop abuse of the
child; after police intervention, Licadho had been granted temporary legal custody
of the child. The adoptive parents appealed the court decision. In April the Phnom
Penh municipal court ordered Licadho to pay damages of five million riel
(U.S.$1,250) to a Phnom Penh orphanage,without specifying the basis for the fine.
Licadho had earlier filed a complaint against the orphanage for trafficking in
babies.
In August, the Cambodian military filed charges of defamation against members
of the Cambodian Human Rights Action Committee (CHRAC) in Kompong
Cham province. The complaint concerned a CHRAC report sent to different government institutions in March, requesting the resolution of eighteen human rights
abuses by soldiers between 1997 and 2001.
In April, several unidentified men physically attacked the director of Global Witness,
an independent forestry monitor, after the group uncovered evidence of illegal
logging. The government quickly denounced the act, but had not apprehended
any suspects as of November.
Police and local officials in Ratanakiri and Mondolkiri provinces bordering
Vietnam threatened villagers with arrest if they assisted Montagnard refugees.
Authorities forced villagers in both provinces to thumbprint statements pledging
not to help the refugees. On May 16, police arrested a fisherman in Mondolkiri
province because of his alleged assistance to Montagnards seeking refuge. After
three months in prison, charges of human trafficking were dropped and he was
released on August 12. On July 5, police arrested another man in Mondolkiri and
detained him in prison on charges of hiding illegal immigrants.He was released on
July 27, after charges were dropped.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
The Cambodia Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights
(COHCHR) and UNHCR maintained field presences in Cambodia throughout the
year. After protracted negotiations, in February the Cambodian government and
COHCHR signed a memorandum of understanding, formalizing their cooperation
into early 2004. The special representative of the U.N. secretary-general for
human rights in Cambodia conducted four missions to the country, in which he
focused on political violence, judicial reform, and the right to education. In public
statements he condemned the forced deportations ofMontagnard refugees to Vietnam,
torture of detainees in custody, and mob violence. The then U.N. high commissioner
for human rights, Mary Robinson, visited Cambodia in August,
highlighting the problem of human trafficking and expressing concerns about the
deportation or disappearance of Vietnamese and Chinese refugees who had been
under the protection of UNHCR.
In March UNHCR publicly denounced intimidation and attacks on UNHCR
staff and refugees at the Mondolkiri refugee camp by Cambodian and Vietnamese
officials, and in April called for Cambodia to honor its international obligation to
provide asylum. In August UNHCR raised concerns with the Cambodian government
over the deportation of two Falun Gong members to China and the disappearance
of Vietnamese monk Thich Tri Luc.
In June, the U.N. Development Program started a four-year U.S.$1.5 million
project to continue building the capacity of the National Assembly and the Senate,
partly in the field of human rights.
Major Donors
International donors pledged U.S.$635 million in loans and grants to the Cambodian
government during the annual Consultative Group meeting of donors, held
in Phnom Penh in June.While commending progress in the areas of financial control,
investment, and land reform, donors expressed strong concerns at the slow
pace of legal and judicial reform, and that no anti-corruption law had been
adopted.
The World Bank approved a $24 million credit for a land management and
administration project, which included a mass land titling program. It delayed the
disbursement of a $15 million Structural Adjustment Credit, apparently because of
the lack of transparency in forestry reform. In September, the bank delayed the
implementation of the second phase of the demobilization program after irregularities
in the first phase were uncovered.
Japan remained the largest bilateral donor to Cambodia, and together with the
European Union (E.U.) and Australia, funded the commune elections.While Japan
and the E.U. generally commended the National Election Committee for the organization
of the elections, they expressed concerns about reports of violence and
intimidation. In July, the European Parliament issued a resolution calling on the
Cambodian government to uphold the right to first asylum for Montagnard
refugees. During a September visit to Cambodia, a delegation of European parliamentarians
announced that the Cambodian government had to ensure that the
2003 national election would be free and fair, if it was to receive further development
assistance from the E.U.
China continued to play an increasingly influential role in Cambodia. In August,
citing Cambodia’s support for the “one China” policy, the Cambodia government
announced that the Dalai Lama would not be allowed to attend an international
Buddhist conference, scheduled to take place in Phnom Penh in December. In
August, China pledged 20 million yuan (U.S.$2.4 million) in assistance to Cambodia
for military training and military hospitals.
Several donors, including Australia, Japan, France, and the U.S., urged the U.N.
secretary-general to resume negotiations with Cambodia in regard to the Khmer
Rouge tribunal. In April, India offered assistance to the Cambodian government if
it decided to try Khmer Rouge leaders by itself. China continued to oppose any
Khmer Rouge tribunal.
The U.S. resumed funding for HIV/AIDS, education, and anti-trafficking projects
in Cambodia after a five-year moratorium on financing government projects
as a result of the 1997 coup. In a report on human trafficking released in June, the
U.S. ranked Cambodia in the lowest category for not complying with minimum
standards to combat the practice. The report stated that if the situation did not
improve, the U.S. might cut non-humanitarian and non-trade-related assistance.
In October, the U.S. condemned the increase in political violence in advance of
national elections. The U.S. resettled about eight hundred Montagnard refugees
during the year.
