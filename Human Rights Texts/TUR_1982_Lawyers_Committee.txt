TURKEY
The current Foreign Assistance Act provides $402.7 million in military aid to Turkey. An increase to $759 million in 1984 has been requested. Given this huge commitment, it is clearly in the interests of the U.S. State Department to minimize human rights violations in Turkey in its Country Report.
The Report attempts to justify severe human rights violations in Turkey (1) by showing that the present military government was forced to impose martial law in order to put an end to "mounting terrorist violence" under the previous government, and (2) by claiming that the present government of Turkey is "in the process of restoring parliamentary democracy."
Although the military government of General Evren has been in power since September 1980, considerable space is devoted to describing the terrorist violence which existed in Turkey before the generals seized power. The Report credits the present government with bringing that violence under control, but minimizes the government-sanctioned terrorism that replaced it. For example, the second paragraph of the report mentions arrests by the military government of an unspecified number of "members and supporters of the heavily
-96-
armed terrorist groups," and then give the precise number of weapons seized (700,000), their worth in dollars (more than a billion) and the number of murders daily in pre-martial-law Turkey (20). The Report also gives statistics on the "significant reduction" of terrorist activity since the military takeover. Only later in the Report is it mentioned that the number of people arrested by the Turkish government in its first year was 30,000, according to its own statistics, and about 7,000 in 1982. The Report does mention"a recent report" citing over 50,000 arrests, but concludes the paragraph with assurances that "most of the arrests are reportedly for terrorism or support of terrorist or extremist organizations." It is not until much later in the report that mention is made of the arrest of former Prime Minister Ecevit and other people clearly not associated with terrorist groups. And even then, the 44 arrested members of the Turkish Peace Association, a group which includes the President of the Istanbul Bar Association, the chairman of the Doctors Council of Turkey and former members of parliament, are described as "administrators of the leftist 'Peace Association' who have been accused of working for the overthrow of the state and society and of supporting terrorism, on the basis of links with the Communist-front World Peace Council."

Other examples of the Report's frequent references to the past are found in statements such as: "Politically motivated killings by private groups were very common before the military government came to power" and have now "virtually stopped." In discussing torture under the present regime, the report goes out of its way to say that torture is "a practice that existed under past civilian regimes" and to commend the present Turkish government as "the first in Turkish history publicly to admit that torture ... has occurred and to punish offenders." The Report devotes one sentence to acknowledging that Amnesty International, the Council of Europe and others have expressed concern over continuing reports of torture in Turkey. It does not mention the conclusion drawn by Amnesty that torture is being practiced on such a wide scale in Turkey that "it is impossible that it is being carried out without official sanction." To the contrary, the Report states that "torture does not seem to be tacitly condoned by the authorities. Turkish authorities have continued to investigate allegations of torture and to publish their updated findings."
The Report's claim that the Turkish government is "in the process of restoring parliamentary democracy" is based on the new Turkish Constitution which was approved by a large majority of Turkish voters in a national referendum in
-98-
November. The Report claims that the Constitution "provides for basic human rights," but does not deal with the substance of criticisms by intellectual, political and religious leaders, who have called the Constitution an authoritarian document strictly limiting rights and freedoms, assuring the continued rule of General Evren for at least seven years and banning any political activity by the main political leaders in Turkey for the next ten years. The Report mentions but glosses over the fact that all public criticisms of the Constitution were eventually prohibited in the months preceding the referendum. The Report does not mention questions that were raised about the fairness of the balloting in which colored ballots were inserted in transparent envelopes which revealed the nature of a citizen's vote.
Instead, the Report frequently cites provisions of the new Constitution, even though it is too soon to determine whether or not they are being followed. In discussing the 45-day period of detention that is permitted under martial law, for example, the Report calls attention to "the rights of the arrested person in the new Constitution, including the right to arraignment, trial, or release, within a reasonable time, and the notification of next of kin." The Report does not mention reports that people have been held without charges and denied access to their families and lawyers. Nor does
-99-
it mention reports of torture and deaths during the detention period.
One of the most glaring oversights in the Report is its almost total refusal to acknowledge the problem of the--Kurdish-speaking population of Turkey. Only twice are the Kurds even mentioned, once as a "banned language" and once in a matter-of-fact statement that "The large Kurdish minority can participate freely as long as they accept a Turkish national identity; Kurdish-language publication and autonomous movements are forbidden." This dry statement gives the reader no indication that the Kurdish-speaking peoples of Turkey, who make up about one-eighth of the population, are perhaps the most tragic victims of human rights violations in Turkey. The government refuses to recognize them as a separate ethnic group; the public use of their language, customs and writings is banned and no reference can be made to them as a group. Since the military coup, thousands of Kurdish-speaking citizens of Turkey have been imprisoned, charged with "Kurdish propaganda" or secessionist violence.
Also perfunctory is the Report's mention of the fact that in July 1982, five European nations - Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden - brought a human rights complaint against Turkey before the Council of
-100-
Europe's European Commission of Human Rights. The Report elaborates on that fact only by saying that "the examination of that complaint, which normally would have begun within three months, has been postponed until January 1983 at Turkey's request." The Report does not mention that the human rights violations with which Turkey is charged include torture and violating the rights to liberty and security of person, to a fair trial, to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, to freedom of expression and of peaceful assembly and association. Nor does it mention a conclusion reached by the five countries that is in direct contradiction to the views of the United States State Department, i.e., that "a public emergency threatening the life of the nation" does not exist in Turkey at this time and that, in any case, the practices of the military junta are in excess of what is demanded by the exigencies of the situation.
