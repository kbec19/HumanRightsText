 PANAMA
 
 Panama is a republic governed under a Constitution
 promulgated in 1972. A transitory provision of
 tne Constitution granted General Omar Torri3os,
 Commander-in-Chief of the National Guard, broad
 powers as "maximum leader of the Panamanian revolu-
 tion" for a six-year period ending in October 1978.
 With the expiration of these powers, Torrijos has
 retained only his position as. Commander-in-Chief,
 but nevertheless maintains an active role in some
 areas of government affairs. His candidates for
 President and Vice President, Aristides Royo and
 Ricardo de la Espriella, were elected for a six-year
 term by the National Assembly of Community Repre-
 sentatives on October 11. The National Guard is
 not represented in the new Cabinet.
 The Government has redefined its political structure.
 A High Level Commission, instituted at the behest
 of General Torrijos and composed of both pro- and
 anti-government factions, met in August-September
 1978 to dtaw up recommendations on political and
 constitutional reforms. While its proposals for
 the legalization of political parties were enacted
 essentially intact, its proposals for constitutional
 reform were in large part superseded by government-
 endorsed amendments. As enacted by the National
 Assembly in October 1978, these constitutional
 reforms provide for: direct election of President
 and Vice-President beginning in 1984; approval by
 the National Assembly of certain categories oï¿½
 executive appointments, including Supreme Court
 Justices; ana creation of a National Council on
 Legislation elected from among the members of the
 National Assembly. Beginning in 1980, the Council
 is to be enlarged with one-third of its members
 elected at the provincial level by direct elections.
 The effect of these reforms will only become apparent
 over time. The Government provides economic and
 social benefits to the poorest sectors of the pop-
 ulation, but these efforts have been impeded somewhat
 by the country's continuing economic difficulties.

 I. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is not a policy ot the Government and no
 incidents of torture have been reported during
 1978.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Criminal punishments are limited by law to fines
 and/or prison terms. The maximum prison term is
 twenty years. There is no capital punishment.
 Physical conditions in Panamanian jails are primitive.
 Occasional physical abuse of prisoners by the police
 occurs. Though officially condemned, it is sometimes
 tolerated by those in authority without disciplinary
 action being taken.
 In June 1978, a Panamanian under interrogation died
 allegedly as.a result of a beating by a National
 Guardsman. An investigation was conducted, and the
 Guardsman reportedly was turned over to the Civil
 Courts, where he is being tried for homicide. The
 case has been brought to the attention of the Inter-
 Ainerican Human Rights Commission.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Some Panamanians allege the occasional use of arrests
 as "object lessons"; a person is jailed over the week-
 end, with no charge, and on Monday morning is told
 that it was a mistake and is released. Such cases
 are not common. The Inter-American Human Rights Com-
 mission (IAHRC) in a recent report presented some
 evidence suggesting that the police "night court",
 in particular, may be administered in an arbitrary
 fashion.
 Official notification to the Embassy in cases of
 detentions of United States citizens is sporadic.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In December 1977, the Government revoked Decree Law
 342 of 1969 which allowed interrogation, judgement
 
 
 310
 and sentencing without adequate safeguards of indi-
 vidual rights. Prior to its revocation, the Decree
 haa been invoked only four times in 1976, after
 several years of disuse, and not at all in 1977.
 Article 197 of the Constitution establishes trial
 by jury, but also provides that the classes of
 cases to be decided by that system shall be deter-
 mined by law. In practice, only serious criminal
 cases such as homicide are tried by jury with the
 accused present. Otherwise, except for a very in-
 formal "night-court", criminal cases are generally
 conducted by deposition without the presence of
 the accused. The decision is made oy a judge upon
 consideration of written presentations by the
 prosecution and defense which are available for
 examination. Apparently this latter procedure is
 used because of the heavy case load. The military
 intelligence branch of the National Guard has de
 facto right of review of all aspects of procedure.
 The right to appeal, both the charges and the sen-
 tence, is available to the prosecution as well
 as the defense.
 Article 192 of the 1972 Constitution provides that
 magistrates and judges are independent, subject
 only to the Constitution and the law. In practice,
 the judiciary appears to be susceptible to the
 influence of the Executive Branch.
 In summation, it would appear that Panamanians have
 the benefit, in ordinary criminal cases, of a fair
 and public trial. The lack of judicial independence
 continues to be a cause for concern in politically
 sensitive cases, although the past year has shown
 progress with changes in both legal structure and
 practice.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The inviolability of the home is guaranteed under
 Article 25 of the Constitution. There is no evi-
 dence that this provision is not respected.
 .2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 
 
 311
 Fulfillment of these four needs is specifically
 defined in the Constitution as an obligation of the
 State. The Government has unambiguously noted the
 need to improve the standard of living of the poor
 and has made significant efforts to do so. Its
 national development plan stresses a higher rate of
 economic growth and a wider, more equitable distri-
 nution of the benefits of this growth. These objec-
 tives have been translated into explicit policies
 and programs providing vital social services such
 as free education, health care at minimal cost, price
 controls on basic foodstuffs and subsidized housing
 projects.
 Recognizing the wide disparities between urban and
 rural areas in levels of income and development, as
 well as the importance of rural areas to national
 development goals, the Government has adopted a re-
 gional development policy, the basic goal of which
 is to improve the quality of life of the peasant.
 Major programs which have emerged from this policy
 include: an expansion of the educational system and
 a revised curriculum more relevant to rural life;
 an expansion of the health services delivery system,
 including family planning, with health centers con-
 structed in remote areas and utilization of parame-
 dical personnel; the development of market towns
 to provide infrastructure and services necessary to
 rural areas; integrated rural development projects
 to help small farmers increase their production and
 incomes; and, the construction of rural roads to im-
 prove access of remote populations to markets and
 other services.
 The Government has not only issued specific policy
 statements committing itself to these goals, but has
 begun programs requiring significant investment of
 central government budgetary resources ana a willing-
 ness to shoulder substantial debt. Government ex-
 penditures for education have accounted for about
 one-third of the central government budget (excluding
 debt service) over the last several years, increasing
 from $50.2 million in 1972 to a budgeted $77 million
 in 1978 (the largest budget for any one ministry).
 Expenditures for health have accounted for about
 fifteen percent of the budget, increasing from $23.6
 million in 1972 to a budgeted $35.3 million in 1978.
 Panama's pursuit of its goals has been hampered by
 an economic recession influenced largely by interna-
 
 
 312
 tional economic factors. However, the Government has
 continued to make the efforts necessary to progress
 in providing for the basic needs of the poor. Pro-
 grams of international lending agencies carried out
 with Panama for social development in rural areas
 are regarded as very successful. Corruption does
 not seem to be so extensive as to divert significant
 resources toward the nation's elites and away from
 the majority of the population.
 A result of all these programs is a noticeable, posi-
 tive impact on the physical well-being of the popula-
 tion, although substantial income disparities remain.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly.
 Freedom of expression is guaranteed under Article
 36 of the Constitution. However, the press and broad-
 cast news media, though not subject to prior official
 censorship, practice self-censorship and receive
 informal government guidance as to treatment of news
 events. Decree Law 343 of 1969, which together with
 Law 342 defined the rules of self-censorship, was
 abrogated in February 1978. A new law regulating
 the practice of journalism as a profession, written
 in consultation with media representatives, was
 adopted by the National Legislative Council in
 September 1978. It contains no provisions regarding
 censorship.
 In general, there has been greater freedom of expres-
 sion since the Panama Canal Treaty plebiscite debate
 in 1977. Opponents of the Torrijos regime have been
 able to speak out, although some claim that they do
 not receive adequate media coverage wnen they do so.
 The establishment of a private Committee on Human
 Rights in Panama in September 1978 was amply covered
 in the press. The Committee has not encountered any
 problem with the Government.
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed under Article 34
 of the Constitution and is respected in practice.
 
 
 Freedom of assembly is guaranteed under Article 37
 of the Constitution. Decree Law 341 of 1969, which
 was used to curtail freedom of assembly in Panama
 City and Colon by prohibiting rallies or open meet-
 ings of those opposed to the Government, was revoked
 in December 1977. There is no evidence that the
 constitutional guarantee has not been respected since
 then.
 Article 19 of the Constitution prohibits any personal
 privileges, distinctions or discrimination because
 of sex, but some differentiation exists both in law
 and in practice. Although women are generally treated
 without discrimination judicially, there are discrimi-
 natory provisions in, for example, the Civil Code
 and Labor Code. In the latter case, these provisions
 are intended to be protective. Women also suffer
 discrimination in terms of employment opportunity
 and salary rates, but enjoy equal access to educa-
 tion. There are roughly equal numbers of males and
 females enrolled at all educational levels.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of movement within Panama is guaranteed under
 Article 26 of the Constitution and is respected in
 practice. Foreign travel and emigration are also
 entirely free. Although prohibited under Article
 29 of the Constitution, forcible expatriation did
 occur up to 1976. Beginning in May 1977, however,
 the Government began to allow exiles to return.
 In April 1978, General Torrijos declared that all
 exiles could return to Panama without fear of repri-
 sals. Many have done so.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The political system in Panama, basically authori-
 tarian, is undergoing a period of liberalization.
 The Constitution of 1972 originally provided for a
 National Assembly of Community Representatives,
 elected by popular vote but lacking in legislative
 responsibility. With the aaoption of a series of
 constitutional amendments (see introduction above),
 a new legislative body with substantive authority
 has been created, to be composed of a majority of
 members chosen from among the National AssemDly and
 
 
 314
 a minority of members chosen in direct, provincial
 elections in 1980. The President and Vice-President,
 previously chosen in indirect elections by the
 National Assembly, will be chosen in direct, popular
 elections beginning in 1984.
 Under the 1972 Constitution, 505 community representa-
 tives are elected by secret, popular vote for six-year
 terms and constitute the National Assembly. Roughly
 70-80 percent of the electorate participated in the
 election held in August 1978. The 505 community
 representatives are essentially local officials who
 have little real power as a collective entity. They
 also serve in representative bodies at the community
 and provincial levels. This system has thus resulted
 in greater participation in public life at tnose
 levels and also permits a more direct articulation
 of local concerns and interests at the national level.
 The Government consults with a broad range of impor-
 tant non-governmental groups and associations during
 the formulation of policy and initiatives.
 Political parties were banned in 1969. However, the
 ban was not strictly enforced, and legislation was
 enacted in October 1978 to provide legal status for
 political parties. In the interim, some parties had
 maintained their organizational identities, and some
 participated in the 1977 plebiscite debate on the
 Panama Canal Treaties. The opposition parties were
 outspoken in their criticism of the Torrijos regime,
 and discouraged their members from participating in
 the 1978 elections for community representatives.
 Labor unions are generally free to organize and
 operate in Panama under the Labor Code of 1972.
 Membership is voluntary. About 10-12 percent of the
 work force is unionized. One labor union has had
 difficulty obtaining legal recognition despite its
 claim to have complied with all requirements.
 Collective bargaining, prohibited for the last two
 years, is to be restored in January 1979. The
 unions are generally free of outright government
 control or open meddling and are free to criticize
 official economic and labor policies. The Government
 frequently solicits labor's views before making
 domestic policy decisions.

 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Panamanian Government has been an active advocate
 of human rights in international fora. For example,
 at the June meeting of the Organization of American
 States (OAS) General Assembly, Panama supported
 adoption of the Inter-American Human Rights Commis-
 sion (IAHRC) reports on Paraguay and Uruguay.
 At the Government's invitation, the IAHRC visited
 Panama for a week in November-December 1977 to
 investigate various charges. The Commission's re-
 port was released in November 1978. It distinguishes
 between two periods, i.e. from 1968 to 1972 (when
 the current Constitution was approved) and from 1972
 to June 1, 1978, the terminal date of the report.
 The report states that in the first period the Govern-
 ment exercised its powers in a very arbitrary fashion,
 resulting in serious violations of basic human rights.
 In the second period (1972-1977), the report refers
 to "an evident improvement", but noted violations
 with respect to exile tor political reasons, restric-
 tions on freedoms of assembly, expression and asso-
 ciation and interference in the judicial processes
 by government officials. The report concludes that
 "information... does not go so far as to present
 a picture of systematic violation of fundamental
 rights", and notes "that the recent modifications
 of the Constitution... and the promulgation of other
 laws tend to improve the conditions for the effective
 respect of human rights."
 The Government invited a three-man team from the
 OAS and representatives of some thirteen universi-
 ties in Latin America and the United States to
 observe the 1978 elections of community representa-
 tives. These observers appeared to have full freedom
 of movement.
 Panama deposited its instrument of ratification of
 the American Convention on Human Rights in June 1978.
