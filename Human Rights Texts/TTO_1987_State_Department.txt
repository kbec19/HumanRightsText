 TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
 Trinidad and Tobago has been an independent nation since 1962
 and a republic since 1976. The country has a parliamentary
 form of government, and free and fair elections have been held
 at regular intervals since independence. Prior to December
 1986, each election had been won by the incumbent party, the
 People's National Movement (PNM). The election of the National
 Alliance for Reconstruction (NAR) Government on December 15,
 1986 thus marked the first change of political power in 24
 years of independence.
 Trinidad and Tobago's judicial system is independent and based
 on that of the British, with the Privy Council in London
 serving as the highest court of appeal.
 The Trinidad and Tobago police force is striving to reestablish
 its image and reputation as a capable and professional force.
 Contributing to the tarnishing of its reputation was the
 naming of 53 police officers and the then commisioner of
 police in a 1986 commission of inquiry report investigating
 drug abuse in Trinidad and Tobago. The former commissioner
 eventually retired after being acquitted of conspiracy to
 murder charges. The other police officers, suspended just
 after publication of the report in early 1987, are now
 awaiting case-by-case reviews. The service's image was also
 sullied by a series of lethal police shootings in mid-1987.
 Coroner inquests into these commenced later in the year.
 The mixed economy is based on petroleum production and refining
 in addition to agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism. Many
 major industries are either wholly or partially owned by the
 Government, but there is a strong tradition of private
 enterprise and private ownership of property. The economy has
 suffered with the worldwide fall in oil prices, but Trinidad
 and Tobago continues to have a high standard of living and the
 fourth highest per capita income in the Western Hemisphere.
 Political and civil rights are protected by the Constitution
 and generally respected in practice. Labor unions have the
 freedom to organize, bargain collectively, and strike. In a
 country with large Christian, Hindu, and Muslim populations,
 freedom of religion is provided for by the Constitution and
 exists in practice.
 There were no significant changes in Trinidad and Tobago's
 good human rights record in 1987.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings in
 1987.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance.

 TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
 c., Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 rreatment or Punishment
 The C6hstitution forbids such treatment and, according to the
 lai, in  evidence obtained by such means is inadmissible in
 court. -There have been allegations in the press and charges
 in th courts that individual police officers have mistreated
 persons'under arrest. 'The law permits victims of such
 treatment to sue for damages in'civil court and to file
 criminal charges against the individual police officer
 involved. -.The c6drts often 'fihd in fivor of the complainant,
 and police officers found guilty of such behavior are subject
 to 'disciplindry action: There is no eVidence that 'police
 brutality is systematic or condoned by the Government.
 The law-requires a public doroner's inquest in any case in
 which-S pdrson dies while in policecustody. In fact,'in-
 previous years such an inquiry has not always taken place.
 The murder of a member of a local mosque in 1985 aroused a
 great deal of pubiie'interest in this regard." The man was
 stabbed to death by an unknown assailant while in police
 custody. A coroner's inquest was unable to identify the
 killer, but a committee formed by.private citizens to
 invdti7gt& the death has alleged 'that the police were -
 respoiisibreTof the murder. However, no killer has been
 identified.- "Responding to this case and a series of mid-1987
 shob~fxs invoiving police, *the Ministry of 'Nationa1' S~cdfity
 has ordered that the law requiring a 'public cotoner's inquest
 be strictly followed in all cases. This order is being
 foll9dzTerd     'hVebeen several subsequent instances of,
 persfns being 'h6t-y 'police officers, allegedly in-the line
 of duf ,:wfiich tfaV'raised questions as to whether the use of
 letl al force by the police was; in these specific instances,
 justff'ied." Inquests into these instances have been initiated
 aAd' 'af rec ivind close media and'public scrutiny.
 Trinidad and Tobago's prisons are understaffed.
 d. -Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile,- or Forced Labor
 The law specifies--that a suspect-must be charged "as soon as
 possible"'after airest; In practice, police usually charge a
 sustect within 48 hours. The'police can, however, obtain a
 court order to hold a persdn longer in order to gather more
 evidence. The law does not-allow:preventive detention.
 Persons arrested are allowed access to a lawyer of their
 choice Snd have the right to a judicial determination of the
 legality of'their, detention.'- Family members may visit
 detainees. There are recurringcharges in the courts and
 press fhat'the police have Violated one or more of these
 procd8dt~s in individual cases, and the courts, which monitor
 police practices in these matters, often find for the
 complainant.
 There is no forded labor in Trinidad ard Tobago. Although
 Trinidad and Tobago has no relevant laws, it is a party to the
 International Labor Okganization's (ILO) convention on the
 subject.-
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides that accused persons have a fair and
 pubiic trial by an independent judiciary from which appeals
 may be made to the Court of Appeals and eventually to the
 Privy Council in London. Defendants have the right to an
 
 
 618
 TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
 attorney, although not at public expense. All accused persons,
 with the exception of those accused of murder, may be freed on
 bail pending trial. The presiding magistrate may suspend bail
 after consultation with the prosecution and defense. The Chief
 Justice and the president of the law association have led other
 government officials, the media, and the general public to
 focus attention on the large backlog of cases awaiting trial
 or appeal, but there continue to be significant delays in
 bringing cases to trial and in processing appeals.
 There are no political prisoners in Trinidad and Tobago.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits such interference, and these
 prohibitions generally are respected in practice. Warrants
 are required for searches.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of expression, and this
 right is protected in practice by the country's independent
 judiciary, democratic and pluralistic political system, and
 independent and privately owned print media. Academic freedom
 is protected by law and exists in fact.
 Trinidad and Tobago Television (TTT), which operates the only
 television station in the country, is government owned. Its
 coverage is generally unbiased, although disputes have arisen
 over its political broadcasting policy. TTT's official policy
 is to allocate political broadcasting time to the ruling and
 opposition parties in proportion to the share of votes received
 in the last general election. The Government is also allotted
 a specific amount of broadcast time for nonpolitical,
 informational programming. In recent years, the Government
 has received a few applications for the licensing of one or
 more privately owned television stations. No action has been
 taken on these applications. Criteria were submitted to the
 Government by TTT's board in early December 1987 as a first
 step toward leasing TTT's second television channel (which, to
 bring revenues more in line with expenses, now only broadcasts
 on weekends) to a private group or company.
 One of Trinidad and Tobago's two radio stations is government
 owned and one privately owned. Both are currently operating
 without licenses while the Government develops a
 telecommunications policy that will determine the conditions
 under which all broadcasting media will operate in the future.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are protected by law and respected in practice.
 Permits are required in advance for street marches,
 demonstrations, or other public meetings, but these are
 normally granted, including to critics of the Government. The
 Government has dropped charges of unlawful assembly against 14
 of the 16 people arrested in March 1986 for demonstrating
 against the visit of an English cricket team which included
 members who had played in South Africa. The two remaining
 demonstrators were scheduled to be tried in late 1987 or early
 1988. The results of the investigation of the incident,
 ordered by the then Minister of Internal Security, have not
 
 
 619
 TRINIDAD AND TQBAGO
 yet been made public. In another case, a local Muslim leader
 and some of-,his followers were-arrested in September 1987 for
 organizing a series.of unauthorized-public gatherings. Those
 arrested were subsequently released on-bail pending trial.
 The Constitution provides for the right of workers to organize
 and bargain collectively and this right is well exercised.
 Approximately 24 percent of the work force is organized into
 45 labor unions. The unions are independent of government or
 party control, and they effectively represent their, members in
 collective bargaining. The majority of the unions are grouped
 into two labor confederations, the largest of which is
 associated with the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Uniops, while the other is ass6ciated with the Communist World
 Fedetation-of Trade Unions.
 Workers-arbpermitted to strike,.and-employers are permitted'
 to "lock out" workers. The Ministry of Labour acts as an
 impartial-'rdediator...-in.col-lective bargaining impas�,es. If
 mediation. by the Ministry-.fails, and-if-so requested by at
 least one of'the parties, the dispute-may be certified as
 unresolved'and referred.to.the.lndustrial Court, part of the
 indepehdent judiciaryj for a binding.decision.
 c. Freedom-bf Religion         ,
 The right to practice one's religion is provided for- by the
 Constitution and is respected in practice-. There is no state
 religion and no religious test for public office. There are
 large groups of Christians,:Hindus, and Muslims in the
 population. These and other religious groups are allowed to
 maintain association with organizations and individuals in
 other countries.-_Religious groups are free to establish
 places-of worship, and religious trayel and publishing are
 pemmitted. Missionaries are freely permitted to enter the
 country and to proselytizei
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel,- Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on travel either within or outside
 of the country. There have been no reports of abuses of. these
 freedoms.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The citizens of Trinidad and Tobago choose their government in
 free and fair general elections held, as required by the
 Constitution, at intervals nOt.to exceed.5 years. The country
 is governed by a bicameral Parliament:- a 36-member House of
 Representatives whose members are elected by the electorate
 and a 31-member Senate whose members are appointed by the
 President, 16 on the advice of the governing party, 6 on the
 advice.of the opposition, and 9 at the President's discretion.
 The Prime Minister, leader of the majority party in the House
 of Representatives, is the-head of government.- The President,
 elected by Parliament, is the head of state.
 Opposition parties have contested every general election since
 party elections were begun in 1956, except in 1971 when the
 opposition chose not to participate. Several opposition
 parties combined in 1985 to form the National Alliance for
 Reconstruction (NAR) which, in.elections held December 15,
 1986, won 33 of the 36 elected parliamentary seats. The
 
 
 620
 TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
 People's National Movement (PNM), which now forms the
 opposition, had governed since 1956. The election thus
 constituted the first transfer of national political power
 since the attainment of independence.
 The Constitution allows Commonwealth citizens who are legal
 residents and at least 18 years of age to vote.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Trinidad and Tobago has not been the subject of international
 human rights investigations to date. An Amnesty International
 representative responsible for the Caribbean region regularly
 visits the country on routine business. The Government permits
 and cooperates with these visits. Apart from the judiciary,
 which acts on legal cases involving alleged human rights
 violations, the Government has an ombudsman empowered to
 investigate alleged law or policy violations and to report the
 findings to Parliament. Amnesty International is also
 represented by a local attorney who follows matters of
 pertinent interest. This attorney has in the past made claims
 of harassment by the Government because of his human rights
 activities. Charges of perversion of justice filed by the
 Government are still pending against him, stemming from a 1985
 case related to his law practice.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no evidence of widespread or systematic discrimination
 based on race, sex, religion, language, or social status in
 Trinidad and Tobago. All persons are fully protected under
 the country's Constitution. Trinidad and Tobago is comprised
 of various ethnic and religious groups which live together
 harmoniously and respect each other's beliefs and practices.
 Women enjoy equality under the law. Many hold positions inthe
 Government, civil service, political party leadership,
 business, and the professions, although not in proportion to
 their numbers in the population. Women currently serve as
 members of the Cabinet, elected and appointed Members of
 Parliament, parliamentary secretaries, permanent secretaries,
 and members of local government councils. Women's groups
 speak out publicly and are heard on all aspects of public life.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The laws of Trinidad and Tobago prohibit the employment of
 children under the age of 12. Children aged 12 to 18 can only
 work in family businesses, with the exception of children aged
 16 to 18 who may also be employed by certain industries which
 the President has specifically exempted from the law. These
 restrictions are respected in practice.
 There is no nationwide minimum wage rate. However, minimum
 wages have been set by the Minister of Labour for three
 occupations considered difficult to organize into unions: gas
 station attendants, shop clerks, and domestic servants.
 Occupational health and safety is governed by the 1948
 Factories Ordinance Bill which sets requirements for health
 and safety standards in certain industries. A new occupational
 safety bill has been prepared and sent to the legislative
 review committee of Parliament. There has been no action on
 
 
 621
 TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
 the bill. since 1986. A severance and retrenchment bill became
 law in 1985, whict aims at providing improved severance
 benefk.ts for retreri6fhedwQrker4.
