TAJIKISTAN
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Four years after a peace agreement ended Tajikistan’s civil war, political violence
continued and the government moved closer to single-party rule. It imposed
increasing control over political and religious life by obstructing political opposition,
arresting citizens on religious grounds, and severely restricting the media.
Torture by police and security forces remained endemic.
Assassinations of high-ranking political figures reflected ongoing internal
power struggles between and within the parties to the 1997 peace agreement—the
government, led by President Emomali Rakhmonov, and the United Tajik Opposition
(UTO), now disbanded. On April 11, Deputy Interior Minister Habib Sanginov,
a former UTO political representative and key contributor to the peace
negotiations, together with two of his bodyguards and driver, was shot by three
unidentified assailants in Dushanbe. Sanginov’s relatives dismissed the official version
for his killing—that Sanginov had refused to repay a loan—and asserted it was
connected to his efforts to identify illegal criminal groups with alleged links to the
government. Authorities detained and harassed Sanginov’s friends and relatives,
causing at least one to flee the country. On July 17,gunmen killed Karim Yuldashev,
a presidential foreign policy advisor, at his home in the capital. On September 8,
Minister of Culture Abdurahim Rahimov was shot by unidentified gunmen outside
his home in Dushanbe.
Renewed fighting between former UTO members and government forces in
2001 highlighted continuing distrust between the two sides and shortcomings in
the demobilization process envisaged in the 1997 peace agreement. In June, former
UTO field commanders based in northeastern Tajikistan took hostage at least four
policemen in Teppa Samarkandi and fifteen members of a German humanitarian
aid organization in Tavil-Dara.The kidnappers protested the arrest of former UTO
members in connection with the murder of Habib Sanginov. All hostages were
released unharmed,but a military operation against the rebel fighters ensued.Local
legal experts and journalists reported that government forces’ indiscriminate fire
killed or injured up to eighty civilians, and that Tajik law enforcement agencies beat
civilians and looted.Authorities acknowledged six civilian deaths.
UTO representation in the government, mandated by the peace accords,
remained at best a formality, as in practice their officials and parliamentary
deputies supported official policy and the president on almost all points. In 2001
the government moved to consolidate its de facto single-party control by banning
and denying registration to opposition parties.The Adolatkhoh (Justice) party was
banned on charges of violation of the law on political parties, and party officials
claimed that its supporters had been intimidated by authorities into denying membership
in the party. Registration documents for the Social Democratic Party languished
with the Ministry of Justice. Pro-government candidates in the December 2000 and May 2001 parliamentary by-elections ran uncontested, as opposition
candidates were denied registration on charges of violating electoral procedure.
The government harassed and arrested several members of the Islamic Revival
Party (IRP), a key part of the former UTO, claiming they were members of Hizb ut-
Tahrir (Party of Liberation), a banned Islamic organization. The IRP claimed that
only one of its members supported the organization and that the government was
using the crackdown against Hizb ut-Tahrir as a pretext to weaken the IRP.
Courts handed down increasingly severe sentences against scores of Hizb ut-
Tahrir members. Whereas in previous years sentences ranged between five and
twelve years, on charges of inciting religious hatred, distributing antistate literature,
membership in banned organizations, and attempted violent overthrow of the
state, in 2001 these charges brought sentences of up to fourteen years of imprisonment.
Hizb ut-Tahrir advocated Islamic government and reestablishment of the
caliphate by peaceful means.
The government continued severely to restrict freedom of expression. The sole
state-owned publishing house for newspapers continued to censor material critical
of the government or influential public figures. The authorities “counseled” all
media on political content, and enforced pre-publication censorship and burdensome
licensing procedures for media outlets. The government granted broadcast
licenses to one independent radio station in northern Sugd province,while authorities
in Dushanbe continued for a fourth year to deny operating licenses to both
independent radio and television stations.
The authorities attempted to punish a foreign-based journalist for his criticism
of the government. On July 5, Dodojon Atovullo, exiled editor-in-chief of the
opposition newspaper Charogi Ruz (Light of Day), was arrested in Moscow, upon
the request of Tajik law enforcement agencies. Atovullo had in recent years published
articles accusing Tajik authorities of corruption and involvement in narcotics
trafficking. Threatened with extradition back to Tajikistan to face charges of
sedition and publicly slandering the president, he was released after six days after
pressure from other governments and international organizations.
Tajik authorities continued to refuse entry to more than 10,000 Afghanis who
fled fighting in northern Afghanistan in late 2000.The government claimed that the
presence of armed combatants among the refugees posed too great a security risk
to Tajikistan and that the country lacked the necessary economic and social
resources to accommodate them. The displaced Afghanis were living in squalid
conditions on islands in the Pianj River on the border between the two countries
and were at times subjected to crossfire between United Front and Taliban forces.
Their numbers steadily increased prior to and during the U.S.-led military offensive
in Afghanistan. Authorities also ordered several thousand Afghan refugees
already resident in Dushanbe to relocate to areas south and west of the capital to
“ensure security and public order in places of settlement.”While police harassed
refugees following the order, as of this writing there were no reports of refugees
having been forcibly relocated. In mid-October Dushanbe authorities closed three
Afghan schools, charging that they violated administrative regulations, and refused
to issue identity documents to Afghan refugees.
The International Organization for Migration reported that more than a thousand women, including minors, were trafficked in 2000 to the Middle East and
Commonwealth of Independent States countries,where they were often employed
in the sex industry. Traffickers paid bribes to Tajik law enforcement officials to procure
travel documents and facilitate travel arrangements.
Antipersonnel landmines remained a feature of the Tajik landscape in 2001.
Most were laid by Uzbek government forces in 2000, in response to the incursions
of that year by the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan through Tajikistan into Uzbekistan
and Kyrgyzstan.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Local human rights defenders raised human rights violations in international
fora, but the atmosphere of fear and intimidation prevented active monitoring and
advocacy within the country. One notable initiative included a roundtable on the
death penalty jointly organized by the OSCE and the League ofWomen Lawyers of
Tajikistan. A principal recommendation was a moratorium on the death penalty.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
Tajikistan assumed a high profile as the U.S. military counterterrorism campaign
in Afghanistan got underway. It was of strategic importance both for humanitarian
relief operations in northern Afghanistan, and potentially as a base for U.S.
military deployment. International actors seeking to bolster financial assistance to
Tajikistan in recognition of its new strategic role made no effort whatsoever to take
into account the country’s dismal human rights record. Tajikistan was granted
membership in NATO’s Partnership for Peace program.
United Nations
The U.N. Office of Peace-Building (UNTOP), the United Nation’s small peacebuilding
mission that followed six years of peacekeeping operations, made a priority
of attracting international assistance for job creation programs for former
combatants and improvements of the rule of law. The UNTOP mission’s staff
included a human rights officer, whose brief, however, did not include human
rights monitoring.
The U.N.High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR) pursued a wavering policy
regarding the displaced Afghanis on the Pianj river islands. In early 2001, the
high commissioner requested the Tajik government to create the necessary conditions
to admit the displaced, by, among other things, separating combatants from
civilians and moving the latter to a safer area. When the authorities refused,
UNHCR suspended its own relief operations on the islands in mid-March, also
arguing that effective relief could not be delivered until combatants were separated
from civilians. UNHCR continued to press the Tajik government on devising a
strategy for separating combatants from civilians.
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
The OSCE mission headquarters in Dushanbe and its field offices in Khujand,
Shaartuz, Dusti, and Kurgan-Tiube intervened in several individual human rights
cases involving torture, rape, murder, and commutation of the death penalty. It
monitored policies in southern Khatlon province on employment and access to
land that discriminated against the Uzbek minority, visited some of the country’s
prisons, and did limited trial monitoring. Other notable activities included round
tables on the death penalty and trafficking of women and children and the initiation
of a project to train prison personnel. The mission also provided legal assistance
to Tajiks deported from Uzbekistan and helped to draft new laws on the
media to bring them into conformity with international norms. It did not,however,
publicly intervene to attempt to prevent the single-party elections in May.
Russia
After the September 11 attacks in the United States,Russia for the first time publicly
admitted its longstanding provision of material support to the United Front,
delivered via Tajikistan. It also increased this support during the course of the U.S.
campaign. Tajikistan’s role as a strategic partner in the U.S.-led operation in
Afghanistan became possible when Russia cleared the way for U.S. use of Tajikistan’s
airports.
In October, Russia sent at least 1,500 troops to Tajikistan, adding to the already
more than 10,000 Russian border guards stationed along the Tajik-Afghan border,
and about 10,000 troops of the 201st Motorized Rifle Division headquartered in
Dushanbe.
United States
Tajikistan became a strategic partner in the U.S. government’s counter-terrorism
campaign when it offered the use of airports by U.S. forces should the need
arise, and the United States continued to channel important amounts of humanitarian
aid through the country. The State Department’s annual report of human
rights practices delivered an unbiased and in general accurate account of the
human rights situation.
International Financial Institutions
Donor activity increased significantly in 2001, largely in reaction to the recognition
of Tajikistan’s importance to Central Asian security.A U.N.-sponsored donors’
conference in May resulted in pledges of U.S. $430 million for poverty reduction
and economic growth in 2001-2002. In addition, the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development contributed $2 million for rehabilitation and $13 million
in loans for telecommunications modernization,while the World Bank issued
a $50 million tranche of a continuing loan for poverty reduction programs and economic
reforms. The Asian Development Bank made a $4.4 million loan for reconstruction of water supply systems.During the course of the U.S.-led military coalition
operations in Afghanistan, Germany included Tajikistan on its list of priority
countries for development assistance.
