Source countries primarily included Romania and Bulgaria. During the year the government identified seven victims of trafficking. At year's end authorities were prosecuting one perpetrator for trafficking, and had tried and convicted ten others for procuring prostitution and human trafficking.The law prohibits all forms of trafficking in persons. The law criminalizes trafficking in human beings for sexual exploitation but does not offer a comprehensive and workable definition of the offense and omits some forms of exploitation, such as forced labor. The penal code provides for fines of $730 to $182,500 (500 to 125,000 euros) and prison terms of one month to three years for facilitating a foreigner's illegal entry and residence through direct or indirect assistance; authorities may apply this law in cases of trafficking for purposes other than sexual exploitation. The law provides penalties from six months' to three years' imprisonment and monetary fines for trafficking. If there are aggravating circumstances, prison sentences can range from one to ten years. Authorities indicated that laws against organized crime may also be used in trafficking cases.There were several cases during the year that resulted in conviction, fines, and prison sentences. For example, in April a French pimp arrested in 2004 and charged with procuring prostitution and human trafficking was sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment and a $2,920 (2,000 euro) fine. In May a French pimp arrested in 2006 and charged with procuring prostitution and human trafficking was sentenced to 24-months' imprisonment and a $2,190 (1,500 euro) fine.There are no government services specifically for victims of trafficking; however, two NGOs which were fully financed by the government provided shelter and counseling assistance to women in distress. Although the country has no formal witness protection program, the government took substantial measures to protect victims' physical safety and identities. After the court proceedings had finished, a criminal investigative unit specialized in trafficking in persons investigationsassisted victims in creating new identities and settling them abroad.The Ministry of Justice was responsible for the government's antitrafficking efforts, in cooperation with the ministries of foreign affairs and equal opportunity as well as NGOs.The government improved its law enforcement efforts with the creation of a special police unit to investigate trafficking-related crimes.Persons with DisabilitiesThe law prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities in employment, education, access to health care, or in the provision of other state services, and the government effectively enforced these provisions. The law does not require government or privately owned buildings to be accessible to persons with disabilities, but the government subsidized builders to construct "disabledfriendly" structures. Despite these incentives, only a small proportion of buildings and public transportation vehicles had been modified to accommodate persons with disabilities. Aid for Handicapped Children, an NGO, is in charge of protecting the rights of persons with disabilities.There are laws establishing quotas requiring businesses that employ more than 25 persons to hire workers with disabilities and pay them prevailing wages, but the government acknowledged that these laws were not applied or enforced consistently.Other Societal Abuses and DiscriminationThere were no reports of official or societal discrimination based on sexual orientation or against persons with HIV/AIDS. Section 6 Worker Rightsa. The Right of AssociationThe law provides for the right to form and join unions without previous authorization or excessive requirements, and workers exercised these rights.

Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory LaborThe law prohibits forced or compulsory labor, including by children, and there were no reports that such practices occurred.d. Prohibition of Child Labor and Minimum Age for EmploymentThe government effectively implemented laws and policies to protect children from exploitation in the workplace. The law prohibits the employment of children under the age of 16. Apprentices who are 16 years old must attend school in addition to their job training. Workers under the age of 18 have additional legal protection, including limits on overtime and the number of hours that can be worked continuously. The ministries of labor and education effectively enforced the child labor laws.e. Acceptable Conditions of WorkThe national minimum wage for a single worker over the age of 18 was approximately $2,190 (1,503 euros) per month for unskilled workers and approximately $2,630 (1,804 euros) for skilled workers. The minimum wage was not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family; however, most employees earned more than the minimum wage.The law mandates a maximum workweek of 40 hours. Premium pay is required for overtime or unusual hours. Sunday employment is permitted in continuous-process industries (steel, glass, and chemicals) and for certain maintenance and security personnel; other industries must request permission for Sunday work, which the government granted on a case-by-case basis. Work on Sunday, allowed for some retail employees, must be entirely voluntary and compensated at double the normal wage or with compensatory time off on another day, equal to the number of hours worked on Sunday. The law requires rest breaks for shift workers and limits all workers to a maximum of 10 hours per day including overtime. The labor inspection court and then the Superior Court of Justice are responsible for enforcing these laws.The law mandates a safe working environment. An inspection system provided severe penalties for infractions. The labor inspectorate of the Ministry of Labor and the accident insurance agency of the social security ministry carried out effective inspections. No laws or regulations specifically provided workers with the right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to their continued employment; however, every worker has the right to ask the labor inspectorate to make a determination regarding workplace safety, and the inspectorate usually did so expeditiously.
