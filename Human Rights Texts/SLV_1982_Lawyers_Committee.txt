EL SALVADOR
While acknowledging that "serious human rights problems continued" during 1982, the Country Report paints-a relatively optimistic picture of El Salvador. Basic to this optimism are two broad observations: that the country is "in transition to a multiparty democracy"; and that there were "signs of [human rights] improvement throughout the year." Both of these carefully worded observations seriously distort the reality.
For example, the Report contrasts the Magana government with El Salvador's pre-October 1979 political structure, calling the latter a system "closed to participation by other than a few officially-accepted parties, under the control of an economic oligarchy backed by the security forces and the military." Despite the claim that the coup of October 1979 changed this situation "fundamentally," one could hardly find a more apt description of El Salvador's current political structure and leadership. That the reformist element of the government is marginal to real power is nowhere more evident than in the rash of assassinations of Christian Democrats since the March elections and the abductions of FDR members. These assassinations and abductions are attributable to military, paramilitary and auxiliary forces

such as the civil defense committees. The Report's statement that the elections "shifted the ground of political action" is therefore only half-true: shifted, yes, but to where? To the greater control of rightist elements, that have made it impossible for the left (that is, the FDR) and the center (that is, the Christian Democrats) to take part in government by kidnapping and murdering their members.
Using Salvadoran press sources (which essentially reprint official military figures), and considering these a valid basis for data even on rural areas, the Country Report concludes: "There was a significant decrease in political violence in 1982." Reporting by human rights organizations in El Salvador also shows a decline in reported, verified civilian political deaths, but these reports are necessarily incomplete, as violence has been concentrated in rural areas off-limits to human rights monitors (as well as the press). It is quite impossible in such circumstances to estimate the number of innocent dead, and misleading to state categorically that their numbers have declined. The most important fact about political murder, as well as disappearance and torture, in El Salvador in 1982, is that these practices continued at levels which would defy belief were we not by now so accustomed to the incidence of atrocity.

As in last year's reports, attribution of political murders is mainly to "extremes of the right and the left," while the Salvadoran military is largely absolved through careful de-emphasis. As to killings: "some groups associated with the military security forces identify and eliminate suspected collaborators" of the opposition. As to arbitrary arrest, this "is permitted under Decree 507." As to torture: it does occur, has even been extreme in some cases, but "appears to have declined in 1982 along with civilian deaths attributed to political violence." In addition, the Report emphasizes the military's efforts to discipline rogue members and auxiliaries who have abused human rights. But its aggregate figures on the numbers jailed refer to "abuses of authority," not necessarily human rights violations, making this an area subject to debate. The Americas Watch has established that between the beginning of February and the beginning of August (a certification period) disciplinary actions taken against military personnel did not, for the most part, concern human rights abuses. As of December 2, the State Department admitted there had not been a single conviction of any member of the Salvadoran armed forces for a human rights abuse during those months.
Moreover, the Report's portrayal of human rights

monitoring in El Salvador is seriously misrepresentative. It charges that the Catholic Church's and Catholic university's publications on human rights "reflect a pro-FMLN viewpoint." As evidence, it cites the university journal's editorial, position favoring negotiations - a position shared by numerous international organizations and parties and by many members of the U.S. Congress. As we have stated about similar allegations in the past, human rights monitors already working at considerable risk are made more vulnerable by such distortions of their work. The Report adds another distortion as well: the discrediting of these monitors* statistics by criticizing their methods of reporting. Human rights groups do not "rely primarily on newspaper reporting," do not include guerrilla combat deaths in their civilian statistics, and base their numbers on personal testimonies they can verify. The decline in their figures may be attributable more to their careful approach than to a real decline in civilian deaths.
Nor is the attribution of leftist opinions confined to human rights monitors. The primarily Christian Democratic Popular Democratic Union is described as a "left wing" labor federation - as evidence of a government tolerance of trade union freedom that does not exist. The

application of political labels is selective, however. As an example of human rights monitoring, the Report cites the newly-established official Human Rights Commission. This group "will monitor and analyze" human rights conditions and make recommendations to the President. It is too early to tell what, if any, effect the Commission will have. What is clear from the Report is the reason for its establishment: "to overcome what many in the Government feel is the leftist bias of [the existing] human rights groups." With such a political agenda, and with the National Police Chief as one of its members, there is reason for concern that the Commission may not direct much attention to abuses by official forces, but that concern is not reflected in the Report.
