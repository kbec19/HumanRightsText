 PORTUGAL
 After a 48 year dictatorship, the revolution of April
 25, 1974 in Portugal opened the way for dramatic
 improvement in human rights. Overnight, censorship
 was abolished, the secret police was dismantled, and
 free speech was exercised. Exiled opposition leaders
 returned, and political parties were formed. In the
 near anarchy of 1974-75, there were isolated incidents
 of human-rights violations by officials and agencies,
 as well as during the leftist crackdown following the
 unsuccessful rightist coup attempt on March 11, 1975.
 After the unsuccessful leftist coup attempt on
 November 25, 1975, however, respect for human rights
 became one of the cornerstones of the new Portugal.
 The constitution promulgated April 2, 1976 includes
 25 articles spelling out "rights, freedoms and safe-
 guards" guaranteed Portuguese citizens and residents.
 Subsequently, Portugal adhered to the United Nations
 Universal Declaration on Human Rights, the European
 Convention on Human Rights, the International Cove-
 nant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and
 the International Covenant on Civil and Political
 Rights. Portugal was elected in May 1978 to a term
 on the United Nations Human Rights Commission ending
 in December 1981.
 Portugar is encouraging increased economic growth as
 the most rapid method of ensuring the fulfillment of
 such basic social needs as housing, employment and
 improved standards of living. The government negoti-
 ated a package of approximately $370 million in pre-
 accession assistance from the Common Market (which it
 expects to join in 1983), which will be used to improve
 transportation and industrial facilities. Increased
 export earnings helped bring the 1979 balance of
 payments deficit down to a fraction of the 1977 and
 1978 deficits which threatened Portugal's economic
 well-being, while increased tourist revenues and
 emigrant remittances helped offset the rising costs
 of imported oil. A new investment incentive system
 and a compensation program for owners of nationalized
 property have facilitated the creation of jobs for
 Portuguese citizens.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Portugal has been free from torture since the dis-
 mantling of the secret police in 1974. Torture is
 forbidden under Article 26 of the constitution and
 no evidence gained through such treatment may be
 used in criminal proceedings.
 
 
 861
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been no documented cases of cruel, inhuman
 or degrading treatment or punishment since November
 1975. Such treatment or punishment is prohibited by
 the constitution. The death penalty was abolished
 over a century ago for civilian crimes, removed
 from the military penal code in 1977 and replaced by
 a maximum penalty of 28 years imprisonment in a
 penitentiary.
 c.   Disappearances
 Persons are not abducted, secretly arrested or held
 in clandestine detention by police or security forces.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Since November 1975 there have been a few cases in
 which Portuguese citizens were held without specific
 charges longer than the 48-hour period allowed by the
 constitution. In those cases, defense lawyers were
 able to obtain due process for their clients through
 legal efforts and publicity. There are prisoners who
 have been either convicted or detained on criminal
 charges resulting from politically motivated acts of
 violence. The right to habeas corpus is guaranteed
 by the constitution.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Portugal allows no secret trials or condemnations,
 and the judicial system is fair, if at times slow.
 In 1980 Isabel do Carmo and Carlos Antunes, two
 members of the Revolutionary Party of the Proletariat,
 were tried and convicted on charges of conspiracy
 in connection with a rash of bank holdups and bombings.
 They were in jail over one year awaiting trial. The
 only known prisoner who has remained in jail for an
 extended period without trial is the former director
 of the defunct secret police, Silva Pais. Although
 Pais has been imprisoned since the 1974 revolution,
 he has never been formally charged with committing
 any crimes.
 f.   Invasion of the Horqe
 The inviolability of the home and the privacy of
 correspondence and other means of private communica-
 tion are guaranteed. The constitution requires an
 "order of the competent judicial authority" for
 searches of and entries into homes and specifies
 that the consent of the occupants must be obtained
 to enter a home at night. These provisions are
 respected in practice, and any irregularities would
 be subject to immediate scrutiny through the press
 and other institutions.

 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education
 Portugal, although possessing extensive agricultural
 resources and a large farm work force, has not yet
 increased productivity and crop yields enough to
 provide all of its food requirements. The Portuguese
 government therefore has taken the initiative to
 obtain food supplies through import agreements with
 major producers, such as PL 480 agreements with the
 United States. As an incentive to bring the lands
 nationalized following the 1974 revolution into
 production, the government has implemented a policy
 of distribution under which individual former tenant
 farmers are given title to parcels of government-held
 property in the southern region of the country. The
 government also is working with the Agency for Inter-
 national Development in designing and carrying out
 programs to increase fertility of lands in the nor-
 thern part of Portugal. Although most food prices
 are set by government regulatory bodies, this con-
 straint on production incentives will face modifica-
 tion as Portugal prepares to enter the Common Market
 in 1983.
 Since 1975 Portugal has sought to alleviate the
 hardship of the least advantaged, despite severe
 financial limitations. In 1980, the government
 continued its programs for construction of housing
 units throughout Portugal for low-income families,
 including refugees from former Portuguese colonies
 in Africa. In order to improve health conditions
 among rural and low-income populations, the govern-
 ment has pursued programs to construct water, sewage
 and sanitation facilities, and regional health centers
 throughout the country. Many of these projects are
 targeted on the poorest sections of the country. The
 government has used financial assistance from the
 Agency for International Development to help fund a
 number of these activities.
 Education is free through secondary school. Portugal
 has embarked upon a large scale school construction
 program to combat its estimated 35 percent illiteracy
 rate and lack of educational opportunity in rural
 areas. In 1980 the government budgeted $888 million
 for education and science and continued to subsidize
 textbooks and newsprint. The number of schools built
 increased in 1980. Portugal remains a conservative
 society in many respects, and there is still discrimi-
 nation against women, particularly in jobs and
 salaries.
 The Social Security Program is included in the country's
 general budget. In 1980, the government increased
 social welfare payments and pensions, increased the
 
 
 863
 minimum wage, and lowered marginal tax rates to permit
 real income to grow. A number of food items continue
 to be subsidized to make them more accessible to
 lower income groups. Unemployment, at between 11 and
 12 percent, has been the target of government programs
 aimed at strengthening investment.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 These freedoms are guaranteed under the constitution
 and respected in practice, although two provisions of
 law'limit the range of permissible political activity.
 The National Assembly passed the so-called "Anti-
 Fascist Law" in June 1978, prohibiting fascist orga-
 nizations, discussions of corporatism and other
 activities related to "fascism." The law provides
 penalties of from two to eight years imprisonment
 for violations. Because of its vagueness and appli-
 cability to only one side of the political spectrum,
 the law has been questioned by some Portuguese human
 rights advocates. There have been no prosecutions
 so far under the law.
 Portugal's penal code has a provision authorizing up
 to eight years imprisonment for those found guilty of
 "insulting" civil or military bodies, the President
 of the Republic or members of the Revolutionary Council
 or the legislative assembly. A few journalists have
 been prosecuted under this statute. Manuel Murias,
 editor of the weekly A Rua, was sentenced in February
 1980 to 14 months impiri-nent for "insulting"
 President Eanes and the Revolutionary Council. Murias
 was released in September for good behavior.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement, foreign travel and emigration
 are guaranteed by Article 44 of the constitution.
 Domestic travel is not circumscribed. However,
 currency exchange restrictions imposed because of
 balance of payments problems impose some practical
 constraints on foreign travel by Portuguese citizens.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 The political system is a democratic multi-party
 system in which opposition parties operate freely
 with access to the media. Only "fascist" organiza-
 tions are outlawed. The government has respected
 the constitutional provision for universal, secret
 and equal suffrage for all citizens over 18 years
 of age.
 
 
 864
 The April 1978 revision of the civil code guarantees
 full legal equality for women in accord with the
 constitution. Portugal was one of the first signa-
 tories of the United Nations Convention on the
 Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against
 Women. Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo served as Prime
 Minister for five months in 1979, and the Sixth
 Constitutional government had four women in positions
 just below the cabinet level. Women play an active
 role in the political parties, but have not yet risen
 to the top leadership of any significant political
 party.
 Workers have the constitutional right to set up trade
 unions and trade union associations. A law prohibi-
 ting the establishment of more than one national labor
 confederation (which gave a monopoly to the communist-
 dominated General Confederation of Portuguese Workers)
 was revoked in 1976, and a new democratic National
 Trade Confederation (UGT) has been established as an
 alternative to the CGTP. The right to strike is
 protected by the constitution.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Portugal's government has cooperated with independent
 outside investigation of human rights conditions.
