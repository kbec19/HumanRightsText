DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO (DRC)
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
The catastrophic five-year war pitting the Congolese government against eversplintering
rebel groups continued through most of the year with belligerents
killing, raping and otherwise injuring thousands of civilians.After intensified international
efforts to end the war,Angola and Zimbabwe withdrew most of the troops
they had deployed to support the Congolese government. Rwanda returned home
most of its soldiers backing the Goma branch of the rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy
(RCD-Goma),while Burundi, also a supporter of RCD-Goma, and Uganda,
backer of three other RCD factions, also announced troop withdrawal plans, albeit
in October Rwandan and Burundian forces were reported once more to be in
action alongside RCD-Goma as eastern Congo descended further into inter-factional
and inter-ethnic conflict. In return for the Rwandan military withdrawal, the
Congolese government banned Rwandan rebel groups based in eastern Congo and
expelled the leaders of one of them,the Democratic Forces for Rwandan Liberation
(FDLR). The government also agreed to facilitate the disarmament and repatriation
of Rwandan rebels, but initial efforts at persuading them to return home were
largely futile.
In the year or so up to their withdrawal the major foreign actors generally
observed a truce, but local forces, some of which received support from the Congolese
government or from one of the foreign actors, continued combat behind the
front lines in eastern Congo through much of 2002. According to a report by a
United Nations (U.N.) Security Council investigating commission released in
October, Rwandan, Ugandan, and Zimbabwean army officers and Congolese
authorities spurred these local conflicts in order to more easily plunder Congolese
resources. It said these high-ranking officials collaborated with “criminal groups”
in stealing Congolese wealth, and warned that the withdrawal of foreign troops
would not end this exploitation.
Various parties to the conflict met in February 2002 in the inter-Congolese dialogue
called for by the Lusaka Peace Accord of 1999, but they reached only a fragile
power-sharing agreement that left undecided important questions about national
reunification and the political transition. RCD-Goma refused to sign the agreement,
as did veteran opposition leaders like Etienne Tshisekedi of the Union for
Democracy and Social Progress. RCD-Goma boycotted a scheduled renewal of
negotiations in late October.
The government became a state party to the Rome Convention for the International
Criminal Court and also called for the establishment of an international
criminal tribunal to try crimes against humanity committed in Congo before the
date when the ICC came into being. Other actors, too, called for an international
tribunal in the agreement reached as a conclusion to the inter-Congolese dialogue,
but the international community showed little interest in this.
In May some RCD-Goma troops mutinied in Kisangani. In putting down that
uprising, RCD-Goma soldiers, apparently backed by Rwandans, massacred civilians
and military personnel: According to a report presented to the U.N. Security
Council, more than 160 persons were slain.
In August and September hundreds of civilians were killed in the northeastern
province of Ituri, where Ugandan army troops that were supposed to be keeping
order there instead gave backing to one side in a conflict between competing rebel
factions and ethnic militias. In August the Union of Patriotic Congolese (UPC), a
faction predominantly of Hema ethnicity and supported by Ugandan troops, drove
forces of the RCD-Liberation Movement (RCD-ML), led by Mbusa Nyamwisi,
from the provincial capital, Bunia, and killed members of the Lendu and Ngiti ethnic
groups, seen as RCD-ML supporters.RCD-ML forces and predominantly Ngiti
militia then attacked the town of Nyankunde and killed hundreds of civilians,
including hospital staff and patients, the latter slaughtered in their beds.
In Orientale province Nyamwisi’s RCD-ML also lost territory in October to the
Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (MLC) led by Jean-Pierre Bemba.
Advancing eastwards out of Equateur province and reinforced by another RCD
splinter, the RCD-National (RCD-N) led by Roger Lumbala, Bemba’s forces captured
Epulu and Mambasa, driving thousands of frightened civilians before them,
and at this writing were bearing down on Beni in North Kivu.
As Rwandan troops left North and South Kivu provinces in October, local forces
including groups of Mai-Mai and Banyamulenge (Congolese people of Rwandan
ancestry) drove RCD-Goma soldiers from Uvira and surrounding areas, but then
yielded before a new RCD-Goma thrust, reportedly reinforced by Burundian and
Rwandan forces.RCD-Goma troops and Mai-Mai all reportedly killed civilians and
plundered their property during this combat.
Many Banyamulenge originally supported RCD-Goma, but in early 2002 an
important group followed former RCD-Goma officer Patrick Mazunzu in rejecting
the rebel movement’s authority. RCD-Goma troops tried unsuccessfully to suppress
Masunzu’s group. Rwandan government soldiers then joined in attacking the
Banyamulenge, a people whose security had once been a pretext for the Rwandan
army presence in Congo. Rwandan and RCD-Goma troops killed scores of civilians,
including some shot from helicopter gunships, and forced thousands from
their homes.
Combatants from all sides raped and otherwise sexually assaulted women and
girls in the October fighting, as throughout the year. In some cases, victims were
abducted and held for weeks or months to provide sexual and other services.
According to U.N. figures, some two million persons had been displaced by the
conflict in eastern Congo by late October. Humanitarian agencies could meet the
needs of relatively few of them and had to reduce even this limited assistance with October’s intensified fighting. Combatants sometimes hindered humanitarian
work:Mai-Mai took staff of the Merlin nongovernmental organization hostage for
three days in January, and UPC authorities prevented humanitarian flights from
landing at Bunia airport in October.
On taking power in 2001,President Joseph Kabila had pledged to honor civil and
political rights, but throughout 2002 he continued to exercise autocratic powers
inherited from his late father and predecessor, Laurent-Desiré Kabila.According to
decree-law number 3 of 1997, all executive, legislative and judicial powers are vested
in the president.Authorities carried out many abuses under the guise of delivering
justice through the Court of Military Order. In October the prosecutor demanded
the death penalty for 115 of 135 persons accused of having participated in plotting
the late President Kabila’s assassination. Shortly before, the government had
announced the end to a moratorium on the death penalty in place since March
2001.
In December 2001 authorities beat and otherwise injured hundreds of Kinshasa
university students whom they arrested after they had protested against tuition fee
increases. According to the government, three policemen were killed during the
protests. Leaders accused of organizing the protests were arbitrarily detained for
three months, during which time they were severely beaten to induce them to confess
to supposed links with political opposition leaders.
During the year authorities arrested fifteen journalists for publishing articles of
which they disapproved. The publication director of the daily Alerte Plus reported
that he was tortured in detention to force him to reveal sources of a news story published
by the paper. The reporter who wrote the story was also arrested. In the East
Kasai provincial capital, Mbuji-Mayi, the director of the National Intelligence
Agency reportedly ordered three local radio and television stations not to cover
news concerning opposition leader Tshisekedi.
In the zone controlled by RCD-Goma, authorities often detained civilians in
unofficial places of detention, brought no charges against them, and refused them
outside contact. Such detainees included a dozen Banyamulenge whom RCDGoma
agents arrested in Burundi in January with the help of Burundian authorities.
They were reportedly transferred to a container located a short distance from
Goma; at this writing their whereabouts were unknown.
In August and September, RCD-Goma authorities cooperated with Rwandan
officials in forcibly repatriating thousands of Congolese refugees who had sought
safety in Rwanda several years earlier. They made no provision for those who
returned and initially refused to allow humanitarian workers access to them.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Human rights activists faced harassment, abduction, beatings, and arbitrary
arrest in the course of their efforts to work in an extremely hostile environment in
both government-held and rebel-controlled areas of Congo.
In April government agents detained N’sii Luanda Shandwe, head of the Committee
for the Observation of Human Rights, and charged him with treason and sheltering criminals. N’sii faces trial before the Court of Military Order and a possible
death sentence if found guilty.Human Rights Watch and other local and international
advocates asked President Kabila to release N’sii or transfer his case to a
civilian court to be tried in accordance with international fair trial standards, but at
this writing N’sii—who fell ill in prison—remained under military jurisdiction.
Willy Wenga Ilombe, a lawyer and member of the nongovernmental Center for
Peace,Democracy and Human Rights, detained in February for criticizing the government,
was still held at this writing. Golden Misabiko, chairman in Katanga
province of the leading national organization the African Association for the
Defense ofHuman Rights (ASADHO), was detained for eight months and tortured
in 2001, and in March 2002 was forced to flee the country after the prosecutor of
the Court of Military Order ordered his arrest for having criticized government
policy in a radio interview.
In the zone controlled by the Ugandan-backed MLC, authorities detained a local
correspondent of the U.N.-supported Radio Okapi for a week because he had interviewed
child soldiers. In Bunia in early September, agents of RCD-ML, also backed
by Uganda, detained Honore Musoko, founding member of the association Justice
Plus, because he had criticized the human rights record of the faction during an
interview with Voice of America. In late 2001 and early 2002, RCD-ML agents
repeatedly detained Hangi Bin Talent, the representative in Beni of ASADHO. By
mid-year, he had fled Congo.
Human rights defenders were harassed and arrested also by RCD-Goma authorities.
On March 15 agents detained and severely beat Richard Bayunda of the
Research Center for Environment, Development and Human Rights (CREDDHO).
They were apparently reacting to his efforts to protect detainees whose
rights were being abused.After the May mutiny in Kisangani, RCD-Goma authorities
threatened several human rights activists. They detained Dunia Ruyenzi, a
lawyer, in late May when he sought information about the whereabouts of some
detainees. They held Djento Mahundu Bwenge for over a week at the Direction
Générale de Migration (DGM) because he gave an interview to Radio France International.
Also in May RCD-Goma soldiers raided the office of the Study and Action
Group for a Well-Defined Development (GEAD). They seized documents and
equipment and, at the time of this writing,were still prohibiting access to the office.
Soldiers later attempted to intimidate Delphine Itongwa, a leading member of
GEAD, by making a menacing nighttime visit to her house.
In the RCD-Goma-held city of Bukavu, a civil society leader and teacher at the
Catholic University, Professor Byamungu, was assassinated by uniformed soldiers
in July.As of this writing, no one had been arrested for this crime.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
Having spent much effort trying to end the war in the DRC, and satisfied with
the withdrawal of foreign troops and Congo’s disavowal of Rwandan rebels, the
international community appeared willing to mute its calls for accountability in
hopes of ensuring the hard-won semblance of stability.
United Nations
Ambassadors of the U.N. Security Council traveled to countries involved in the
Congo war in May, the third such visit in as many years,underlining the importance
they gave to ending the conflict. On several occasions the council deplored efforts
by belligerents to increase their territory in violation of the truce, condemned the
resurgence of violence, and encouraged steps such as the withdrawal of foreign
troops.
The United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (MONUC) monitored observance of the truce by the primary belligerents
effectively, but did nothing to halt combat among local parties behind the lines.
With some 5,500 troops, most of them stationed far from the eastern region where
local conflicts were most prevalent, MONUC was ill-equipped to carry out the part
of its mandate calling for the protection of civilians at “imminent risk of physical
violence.” This failure was evident during the Kisangani massacre in May. On the
first day of violence no MONUC personnel went out on patrol to deter killing,
although there were dozens of military observers in the city and some one thousand
troops there to defend U.N.personnel. On the second day,MONUC officers did call
for calm, obtained the release of two detained priests, and protected seven other
civilians. Officers of the force subsequently joined representatives of the U.N.High
Commissioner for Human Rights Field Office in Congo in conducting a detailed
investigation of the events. As a number of international actors were calling for
increased resources for MONUC in October, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
proposed increasing the force to 8,700 troops and stationing two strong mobile
units near the zones of conflict in the east.
Following critical comments by U.N. personnel about the conduct of RDCGoma
soldiers, the rebel authorities expelled two U.N. staff members from the
town of Goma and a third from Kisangani. It also declared the secretary-general’s
special representative persona non grata after MONUC reported on the Kisangani
killings as “unjustifiable.” On June 5, the Security Council condemned “in the
strongest terms” acts of intimidation by RCD-Goma against U.N. officials and
called on Rwanda to use its influence to ensure that RCD-Goma obey Security
Council resolutions without delay.
On several occasions during the year, such as on September 30 after combat had
intensified in the east, the Security Council called for an end to human rights abuses
committed by all sides during the war. It issued a particularly strong presidential
statement on July 23 condemning the Kisangani massacres and demanding that
RCD-Goma bring the officers responsible to justice. It also said that Rwanda had a
duty to use its influence over RCD-Goma to see that no further war crimes were
committed.
The special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions went
to Kisangani to investigate the massacre and gathered information that formed the
basis of a report presented by the high commissioner for human rights to the Security
Council in July. This marked the first time that the high commissioner had
addressed the council on the human rights situation in a single country.At its 2002
meeting, the Commission on Human Rights extended the mandate of the special
rapporteur for the DRC.
The Panel of Experts on the Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources and Other
Forms ofWealth of the Democratic Republic of Congo presented its final report to
the Security Council in mid-October.Drawing on extensive documentary evidence
and witness statements, the panel described the networks through which Rwandan,
Ugandan, Zimbabwean, and Congolese authorities had been growing rich at the
expense of the Congolese people. The report explained that various foreign actors
worked to keep local authorities weak and local peoples in conflict in order to make
it easier for them to extract wealth from the area. It also concluded that Rwanda was
not in Congo to protect its security, as it frequently claimed, but rather to “secure
property.” It named not just individual officers but also various corporations—
some international, some national—involved in illegally exploiting the DRC’s
wealth. It called for sanctions against the individuals and corporations if they
failed, after a brief grace period, to halt their activities.
European Union
The E.U. sought to encourage peace by combining incentives and pressures on
all parties to the conflict. The United Kingdom (U.K.) foreign secretary and his
French counterpart visited Central Africa together in January. They were followed
soon after by the Belgian foreign minister and a joint delegation of the U.K.,
Netherlands, and Norwegian ministers for international development.
The E.U. condemned violations of the truce, such as when RCD-Goma forces
took Moliro and Pweto in March. In demanding that these forces retreat, the E.U.
called upon Rwanda to use its influence to see that this was accomplished.On October
22 the E.U. deplored the resurgence of violence in the east and expressed concern
about human rights violations, particularly in Ituri. It endorsed an expansion
of MONUC forces. Shortly after the Kisangani massacre, the E.U. Presidency and
the European Parliament condemned the killings and “the repression of the Congolese
people by RCD-Goma members and Rwandan troops.”The U.K., known to
favor Rwanda, nonetheless played a key role in brokering the agreement between
the Congolese government and Rwanda in July.
As the year-long Congolese program of economic reform yielded some
improvements, various donors rewarded this success and promised further support
if efforts at peace, reconciliation, and democratization continued. In January,
the E.U. approved a National Indicative Program of Û120 million (U.S.$118 million)
for a five-year effort to alleviate poverty and strengthen institutions. This
resumption of development assistance signaled a departure from previous years
when the E.U. denied Congo funds for development while delivering extremely
generous assistance to Rwanda and Uganda, notwithstanding condemnation of
both these governments for their military presence in Congo.
International financial institutions joined in offering new support to Congo.
The donors grouped in the Paris club wrote off more than half of U.S.$9 billion in
debt and agreed to reschedule the rest and to seek similar relief for Congo from
other donors. The World Bank proposed canceling more than 80 percent of outstanding
Congolese debt (to be finally decided on in early 2003). In June, the World
Bank resumed cooperation with Congo by giving a loan of $450 million and a grant of $44 million to help finance part of a $1.7 billion emergency and reconstruction
program.
United States
Like others in the international community, the U.S. focused on ending the war,
a message that President George W. Bush himself delivered to the Congolese and
Rwandan presidents in September. The U.S. condemned the Kisangani massacre,
and its ambassador for war crimes issues traveled to the scene in October. The
ambassador also pushed Congolese authorities to surrender important suspects
sought by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, an effort that netted
one important suspect by October. The U.S. State Department Country Report on
Human Rights Practices for 2001 detailed abuses by government and rebel authorities,
but recognition of the abuses had only limited impact on policy.
