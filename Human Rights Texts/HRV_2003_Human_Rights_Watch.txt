CROATIA
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Ensuring minority rights remained Croatia’s biggest human rights challenge in
2002. The government remained reluctant to lend strong support to the return of
Serb refugees and backed away from its previous record of cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). At the same
time, the government was increasingly committed to pursuing domestic trials to
establish accountability for abuses committed against Serbs during the 1991-95 war.
The government failed to enact a long-pending constitutional law on minority
rights. In February, the cabinet rejected a draft produced by a working group that
included minority representatives. The cabinet then established a new working
group, this time without minority representation. As of November, the group had
not presented a new draft.
Seven years after the Dayton Peace Agreement brought peace to the region, by
the close of 2002 most of the 350,000 displaced Croatian Serbs had still not
returned home. Between January and August, 7,800 Serbs returned (primarily elderly
persons returning to villages), increasing the total number of returnees to
110,000, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR). An unknown number of returnees had departed again for F.R.
Yugoslavia or Bosnia and Herzegovina after a short stay in Croatia. Property issues
remained the principal impediment to sustainable return, with thousands of
returnees finding their pre-war homes destroyed or occupied by others. Lack of
employment opportunities, often resulting from oblique discrimination, also
impeded return.
On July 12, the Croatian Parliament set a December 31 deadline for the government
to issue administrative decisions on return of occupied private properties to
their owners. For property not returned by this deadline, the government obliged
itself to pay compensation to owners who had filed property claims. The amendments
disbanded the inefficient local housing commissions and vested the State
Prosecutor with the authority to file lawsuits against temporary users who refused
to vacate occupied property. The amendments left in place, however, a number of
obstacles to repossession of property. Most significant among these was the
requirement that before evicting temporary occupants the authorities must provide
them with alternative accommodation,which often proved difficult.The right
to alternative accommodation applied even to temporary occupants who could
afford to obtain other housing and to occupants who had previously lived within a
single household but since the war had multiple homes thanks to their occupancy
of Serb houses.
While eviction of illegal occupants of Serb properties was legally mandated, in
most cases in which they refused to vacate the property, the competent housing
commissions had not sought court-ordered eviction.Only at the beginning of 2002
did the Supreme Court abandon its earlier position and rule that owners, as well as
the local housing commissions, could sue to evict illegal occupants. Even where
courts had rendered final decisions in favor of the owner, however, the judgments
rarely led to actual repossession.
The situation was even more hopeless for those who had pre-war tenancy rights
in apartments. Deputy Prime Minister Zeljka Antunovic stated in November 2001
that during the war Serbs had left their apartments voluntarily, and accordingly, they
had as a matter of law lost their tenancy rights. Lovre Pejkovic, head of the government’s
Directorate for Expelled Persons, Returnees, and Refugees, stated in March
2002 that the government had no obligation to former tenancy rights holders.
Roma continued to suffer discrimination in all fields of public life. The Law on
Citizenship required citizenship applicants to have five years of permanent residence
and excellent Croatian language skills, preventing many Roma from obtaining
citizenship. Romani children were segregated into separate and educationally
inferior Roma-only classes. On April 19, a group of fifty-seven Romani children
assisted by the European Roma Rights Center filed a lawsuit against the Ministry of
Education, the Medjimurje county local government, and four primary schools,
charging them with segregation. In October, the municipal court in Cakovec dismissed
the lawsuit, arguing that racial and ethnic origin of the Roma children was
not the reason for the segregation.Roma in Croatia also continued to face discrimination
in obtaining access to housing, health care, and employment.
The judiciary continued to suffer from a large inherited backlog of pending
cases, inexperienced judges and staff, and political influence at the local level, particularly
among judicial appointees of the late President Franjo Tudjman.
In a step back from its previous cooperation with the ICTY, the government
failed to arrest and transfer former general Ante Gotovina to the custody of the tribunal.
Gotovina was indicted in July 2001 for crimes during and after the 1995
Operation Storm.On August 23, 2002, the tribunal prosecutor indicted retired general
Janko Bobetko for war crimes committed against Croatian Serbs in 1993. The
government refused to surrender Bobetko to the court, arguing that the indictment
contravened the Croatian constitution.
In a welcome development, the authorities accelerated domestic prosecution of
ethnic Croats suspected of war crimes committed during the 1991-95 war. Serious
concerns remained about the quality of these proceedings, however. Judicial bias
and witness tampering characterized some trials, including the high-profile trial in
Split for crimes committed in 1992 in the Lora military prison. The witnesses were
scared to speak openly in the courtroom about the crimes, and the presiding judge
demonstrated bias in favor of the accused Croatian soldiers. The trial had not been
completed as of mid-November.
The central government generally did not interfere with the independence of the
media. In February 2002, the state-owned television station declined to air a program
prepared by a renowned journalist on the contemporary heritage of the
Ustashas, the Croatian World War II allies of Nazi Germany. In March, the Zagreb
District Court upheld two lower court libel decisions imposing fines amounting to
U.S.$24,000 on the satirical weekly Feral Tribune (distinguished for debunking
nationalistic myths and researching war crimes against Croatian Serbs). In one of
the judgments, the judge faulted Feral Tribune for publishing “cosmopolitan opinions
and views.”
Croatia continued to be a transit country for international trafficking, but it was
also increasingly a country of destination for a growing number of women and
children trafficked for sexual exploitation from Bosnia and Herzegovina and the
countries of the former Soviet Union.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Robust and professional human rights organizations were active, particularly in
the urban centers of Zagreb, Karlovac, Split, Osijek, Vukovar, Knin, and Rijeka. In
February 2002, a group of leading civil society groups prepared a shadow report for
the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD). In
March 2002, the parliamentary ombudsman submitted its annual report. The
complaints received by the ombudsman mostly pertained to property and housing
rights of Serb returnees, and to pension, disability and medical insurance, and
social welfare. The report noted that ministries and administrative bodies continued
primarily to ignore the ombudsman’s communications.At the July 9 session of
the Parliamentary Commission for Constitutional Issues, a representative of the
ruling coalition, tacitly supported by other coalition members, strongly criticized
the ombudsman for his critiques of the human rights situation in the country.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
On November 30, 2001, the U.N.Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural
Rights issued its concluding observations and recommendations on Croatia’s
implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural
Rights. The committee noted that many post-independence transitional measures
were being amended or superseded by new laws that better conformed to international
human rights principles. The committee nonetheless criticized continued
discrimination, mostly affecting Roma and displaced Croatian Serbs.
In its March 19 concluding observations, the U.N. CERD welcomed Croatia’s
efforts to promote equality.The committee expressed concern at the continued segregation
of Romani children in education and at reports of discrimination against
Roma in access to employment, health, political representation, and citizenship
rights. The committee also urged Croatia to take effective measures to prevent discrimination,
especially against Croatian Serbs, as regards the restitution of their
property, tenancy rights, access to reconstruction assistance, and rights to residency
and citizenship.
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
The six-month report of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) Mission to Croatia presented on May 24 welcomed several important
government policy statements on property repossession, judiciary reform,
regional cooperation, and minority legislation. The report also pointed out the
main areas of concern, including return of refugees and property repossession, the
issue of tenancy rights, and the state of the judiciary and the rule of law. The mission
attempted to develop a dialogue with the government while issuing reports
critical of its return-related practices.
Council of Europe
In a March 1 decision in the case Kutic v.Croatia, the European Court ofHuman
Rights (ECHR) addressed a Serb applicant’s claim for compensation for property
destroyed during the 1991-95 war.The case was typical of thousands of compensation
claims filed by Serb property owners in Croatian courts, which had simply
stayed the proceedings and failed to act on the claims. The ECHR held that there
had been a violation of the right of access to courts and ordered Croatia to pay the
applicant Û10,000 in non-pecuniary damages. In several other cases, not related to
return of Serb refugees, the court also found violations of the right to a fair hearing
within a reasonable time and the right to an effective remedy.
On February 6, the Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the
Protection of National Minorities published its April 2001 opinion on Croatia.The
committee found that implementation of the Framework Convention had
improved regrettably slowly and singled out employment as the area in which the
protection of the Serb and Roma minorities merited urgent attention. In its
response, the Croatian government invoked the consequences of war as a factor
affecting the rights of minorities, and listed legislative and policy reforms underway
to improve its record.
On September 27, Council of Europe Secretary General Walter Schwimmer
recalled that full co-operation with the ICTY was one of the commitments that
Croatia undertook upon accession to the Council of Europe.He called for a swift and
unconditional surrender of the recently indicted General Bobetko to the tribunal.
European Union
Croatia and the E.U. signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement in late
2001. Pending ratification by all E.U. member state parliaments, an Interim Agreement
on the trade-related provisions of the agreement was in effect as of January 1,
2002. In its April 4 Stabilization and Association Report, the European Commission
identified the continuing weakness of the judiciary and nationalistic pressures
in Croatia as the most far-reaching potential threats to the return of refugees, cooperation
with the ICTY, and the achievement of overall economic, political, and
social reform. At the beginning of October, Javier Solana, E.U. high representative
for common foreign and security policy and Danish Foreign Minister Per Stig
Moeller, acting on behalf of the E.U. Presidency, called separately on Croatia to
hand over General Bobetko to the ICTY. On October 21, the Council of the European
Union “strongly encouraged”Croatia to cooperate fully with the ICTY.
United States
During a July 2002 visit to Croatia, United States Ambassador-at-large for War
Crimes Issues Pierre Prosper supported the Croatian government’s efforts to conduct
domestic war crimes trials and take over cases from the ICTY. Prosper’s statements
left it unclear whether the U.S. considered it a priority that such domestic
trials meet international standards.
In July, the United States requested that Croatia enter into an agreement
exempting U.S. citizens from transfer from Croatia to the International Criminal
Court. A spokesman for the Croatian Ministry of Interior expressed a negative
opinion of the proposed agreement,while the president and prime minister linked
Croatia’s response to the E.U.’s position. U.S. Ambassador Lawrence Rossin stated
in September that U.S. support for a possible Croatian application for NATO membership
might depend on whether Croatia signed the agreement.
In October,Ambassador Prosper publicly reminded the government of Croatia
of its commitment to cooperate with the ICTY and urged the government to surrender
General Bobetko.
