ETHIOPIA
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Human rights conditions in Ethiopia did not perceptibly improve in 2002. In
southern Ethiopia they significantly worsened: Police shot into groups of civilians
and conducted mass arrests. Arbitrary arrests, however, were not confined to the
south. Those who were arrested were subjected to prison conditions that did not
meet international standards and some prisoners, particularly in Oromiya regional
state, were tortured. Courts rarely intervened to stop human rights abuses, parliament
not at all. The print media was allowed to publish but was frequently
harassed. The ruling coalition Ethiopian Peoples’Revolutionary Democratic Front
(EPRDF) led by Prime Minister Meles Zenawi maintained a firm grip over the federal
and state governments. Local elections were subject to intimidation and fraud.
The EPRDF also continued to exert control over the judiciary.
Police violence in Tepi and Awassa, in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and
Peoples (SNNP) regional state, resulted in the deaths of more than one hundred
civilians and the arrest of hundreds. In Tepi, members of two minority ethnic
groups, the Sheko and Majenger, clashed in March with local officials and police
over political rights. Some civilians were reported to have been armed with
machetes. At least eighteen civilians and one local official died. In the following
days, more than one hundred were killed and villages razed on the order of local
authorities, leaving some 5,800 homeless. Nearly one thousand civilians were
arrested after the disturbance, and 269 remained in detention when a diplomatic
delegation visited in June.
In the city of Awassa on May 24, soldiers using machine guns mounted on
armored cars shot into a crowd of farmers protesting a change in the administrative
status of the city. The government acknowledged seventeen deaths but independent reports said that twenty-five civilians were killed and twenty-six injured.
Police also shot at crowds of unarmed students in March and April in Oromiya,
Ethiopia’s most populous state. State officials acknowledged that five high school
students were killed and over a dozen wounded when police shot into groups
protesting government educational and economic policies.The Oromiya state parliament
justified the police tactics by asserting that the police had no funds to purchase
non-lethal crowd control equipment.
Police subsequently arrested several hundred students, teachers, and others
whom it accused of being members or sympathizers of the Oromo Liberation Front
(OLF), an armed movement that the government claimed had instigated the student
protests. In June, over three hundred people were incarcerated in Dembi Dolo,
including some seventy school children. Some of those detained there and in Ambo
town, about 130 kilometers west of Addis Ababa (the capital), were tortured.Most
of the prisoners were released on bail two months after their arrests. The government
suspended teachers and civil servants from their jobs.
The government failed to bring police accused of killing civilians to justice in the
above-mentioned incidents, or similar previous incidents, including the killing of
forty students during a strike at Addis Ababa University in April 2001. The federal
government arrested ten officials in August 2002 for their involvement in the
Awassa or Tepi violence. It was not clear, however, whether those arrested were
accused of using excessive force to put down the protests or of having encouraged
civilians to demonstrate in the first place.
Human rights violations continued to be particularly egregious in Oromiya.
Since the government banned the OLF a decade before, thousands of alleged OLF
members or sympathizers had been arrested, and this trend continued in 2002.
(Oromos constitute the largest single ethnic group in Ethiopia, some 40 percent of
the population.) As ofMarch more than 1,700 such prisoners were reportedly held
at the Ghimbi central prison, half of them arrested recently and the rest having been
there for five to ten years, some without charge. Hundreds more were detained in
prisons and police jails across Oromiya state. Prisoners who were released or
escaped from incarceration reported severe torture while imprisoned. The
Oromiya state minister for capacity building, who fled the country in May,
denounced the state government for indiscriminately accusing the Oromo people
of supporting the OLF.
The government continued to crack down on teachers who criticized changes in
education policy and supported the banned Ethiopian Teachers’ Association
(ETA). Dr. Taye Wolde Semayat, president of ETA, was released in May 2002 after
an appeals court reduced his sentence to less time than he had already served. He
had been placed in a fetid cell and shackled while in solitary confinement during
part of his six-year incarceration (Taye had been convicted of plotting to overthrow
the government, though independent observers believed the charges were fabricated).
ETA continued to work to protect teachers’ rights despite the fact that the
government had created a puppet organization with the same name, seized the
original organization’s funds, and sealed parts of its offices. Seven teachers who
supported ETA were arrested in May in Sendafa and held for two months on
trumped-up charges, and more than forty teachers who attended a February ETA conference on education for all and teaching about HIV/AIDS were arrested and
held for two weeks when they returned home. Between August and October
authorities refused permission for and police interrupted and dispersed ETA meetings.
Government officials threatened teachers with dismissal or withholding of
salary if they failed to disassociate themselves from ETA.
Prison conditions were harsh in the provinces and in Addis Ababa.Medical care
was rudimentary and rationed to a handful of prisoners per day. Prisoners with
AIDS reportedly received no treatment, and former prisoners reported having witnessed
deaths of prisoners with serious diseases such as tuberculosis. Prisoners
were denied access to bathing facilities, mattresses, and blankets. Some released in
2002 told of being detained in such crowded confinement that they had had to take
turns sleeping. Food was meager but adequate. Prisoners who had family living
nearby were normally allowed to receive food from family members. In May the
International Committee of the Red Cross reported it had access to 4,800 security
detainees in 150 places of detention.
The judiciary remained unable or unwilling to stop human rights violations. In
May, the federal minister for capacity building acknowledged that the justice system
was generally backward and incapable of enforcing constitutional guarantees.
Often judges refused to release prisoners on bail even when the police or prosecutor
had no proper grounds for their detention. Instead, hearings were adjourned for
two weeks at a time to allow police to investigate. Occasionally, a court would order
the release of a prisoner only for the prisoner to be rearrested and jailed within a
day or two outside that court’s geographical jurisdiction. For example, police
arrested an Addis Ababa businesswoman,Dinkinesh Deressa Kitila, in early June on
accusations she had transported OLF documents in her car. She appeared in court
several times over two months before the local court ordered her released for lack
of evidence.Two days after her release on bail, she was rearrested in another district.
As of October, she remained imprisoned.
Prisoners held for non-bailable offenses were incarcerated for years while their
cases were investigated. In 2001, parliament enacted legislation to prevent anyone
accused of corruption from being released on bail. The law was immediately
applied to the former Defense Minister Siye Abraha, who was also Prime Minister
Meles’ chief political adversary. The former minister and several alleged co-conspirators
had not been brought to trial by October 2002,well over a year after their
arrests. In July the presiding court ordered the prosecution to revise its charges,
assuring further delay. Businesspeople arrested in 2001 on corruption charges also
continued to languish in jail without trial.
The largest single group of long-term prisoners were members of the previous
government, the Derg, accused of genocide, crimes against humanity, and other
serious offenses. Several dozen former Derg officials were brought to trial in 2002,
about a third of whom were acquitted.Hundreds more who had been in prison for
a decade or more still awaited trial, but the Federal High Court claimed to be able
to complete their trials by September 2003.
In some cases, the police and courts began to enforce laws protecting women and
children more seriously than in the past, in particular by making greater efforts to
arrest men who raped children and, when convictions were secured, by imposing prison sentences on some rapists. In Addis Ababa two policewomen were assigned
to each district.However, women’s groups claimed that police often did not investigate
reports of adult rape,while prosecutors took over a year to bring charges and
then only for infractions with the lowest possible penalty. Outside the major cities,
customary law continued to govern intra-family relations including inheritance.
The private print media was allowed to operate but was periodically harassed.
The prime minister called the newspapers organs of illegal political parties and the
minister of information accused them of practicing hate politics. In July, the former
editor of a weekly newspaper was sentenced to two years of imprisonment for
defamation and disseminating false information. Early in 2002, the government
released another journalist on U.S.$2,000 bail after ten months of incarceration.He
had been accused of inciting violence after he had written articles about mismanagement
at a government-owned tannery and about a former general’s prediction
of the government’s imminent overthrow. Other journalists were also briefly
detained and then released on bail for articles they had written. In March, one was
fined U.S.$1,400 for a 1997 article quoting a speech given in the United States in
which the American speaker asserted that the present Ethiopian government was as
bad as the Derg. In each case, the government invoked a Derg-era press law making
defamation, the publication of false information, and incitement criminal offenses.
The government was drafting a new press law and code of ethics, but advocates for
an independent press feared it would be even more restrictive and intrusive than
existing law.
The editor of the only newspaper in Tigray state was arrested in December 2001.
After a state court ordered her release and dismissed the criminal charges she closed
the newspaper and fled the country. The Addis Ababa private print media had no
circulation outside the capital, partly as a result of transportation problems but also
partly because of intimidation by local authorities who regarded the possession of
nongovernment newspapers with suspicion. The government owned the only television
and all radio stations except for one FM station owned by the Tigray Peoples’
Liberation Front (TPLF), the lead political party in the government coalition.
Although the government periodically stated that it would permit others to enter
broadcasting, implementing legislation remained stalled.
Political parties were permitted to exist but their activities were sometimes hindered,
especially at local levels. In December 2001, opposition groups in the SNNP
state boycotted zonal elections, claiming that their candidates had been denied
access to the ballot and had been molested by government party supporters. The
chairman of the South Ethiopian Peoples’Democratic Coalition (SEPDC), Beyene
Petros, one of a handful of opposition members of the federal parliament, accused
the National Elections Board of having assigned government officials and government
party members as election judges. The chairman of the commission deemed
the charge without merit and threatened to sue Beyene. In March 2002, people
known to be government party functionaries disrupted a meeting of the Ethiopian
Democratic Party (EDP) in Awassa at which members were protesting government
acquiescence to revision of the border between Ethiopia and Eritrea. (See below.)
Police present at the meeting failed to intervene.
Issues remaining from the border war Ethiopia fought with Eritrea between 1998 and 2000 continued to fester. In late August 2002, Eritrea repatriated 279
Ethiopian prisoners of war (POWs), stating that it had thereby returned all POWs,
but the Ethiopian government accused Eritrea of still holding prisoners in undisclosed
locations. It demanded information about seventy-three police and militia
members who remained unaccounted for, and about a pilot who had been paraded
through the streets of the Eritrean capital after his plane was shot down in 1998.As
of October 2002, the Ethiopian government continued to hold about 1,300 Eritrean
POWs despite its pledge to release them. Persons of Ethiopian descent who were
deported from Eritrea continued to live under difficult circumstances in fourteen
camps around the country. The Ethiopian government abruptly closed three of the
camps, forcing inhabitants to leave, and announced plans to do the same with the
remaining eleven.
Reliable sources reported that the Eritrean government was giving logistical
support, training, and weapons to OLF guerillas attempting to infiltrate Ethiopia
from Sudan, and to armed Tigrean groups opposed to the current Ethiopian government.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
The Ethiopian Human Rights Council (EHRCO), the most prominent human
rights group, issued a number of reports on human rights violations in 2002,
including on the shootings and arrests in Tepi, Awassa, and Oromiya; on forced
roundups of street children who were then dumped in a remote forest; and on
abuses against deportees from Eritrea. Two leading members of EHRCO who had
been arrested and bailed in 2001, charged with inciting university students to riot,
appeared in court periodically in 2002 but a trial on the merits had not begun at this
writing. The Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association, which like EHRCO had been
temporarily shut down by the government in 2001, faced no overt government
interference in 2002. The government continued to refuse to register the Human
Rights League.
The constitution and legislation empower parliament to establish a human
rights commission and ombudsman to investigate government abuses. A parliamentary
committee solicited nominations to these bodies in 2002 but, as of October,
neither organization had been established.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
Following the end of the war with Eritrea in 2000, international donors began to
provide Ethiopia with more generous aid packages. The United States, European
Union, and United Nations were preparing to respond to a looming humanitarian
crisis due to severe drought.Most international donors remained silent in the face
of human rights violations, preferring to support Ethiopia’s fragile, relative peace
in a troubled region and not wishing to jeopardize Ethiopia’s cooperation in fighting
terrorism.
United Nations and World Bank
An independent boundary commission established as part of the December
1999 cease-fire agreement released a report with preliminary findings in April. The
report generally rejected Ethiopian claims including (without mentioning it by
name) the claim to the village of Badme,where the war had started. Both countries
initially announced that they accepted the commission’s decision, but in June the
Ethiopian government defied the ruling by voluntarily resettling 210 people from
central Tigray to Badme. Actual demarcation of the border in accordance with the
commission’s directions had not begun as of October.
The U.N. Security Council extended until March 15, 2003 the mandate of the
United Nations Mission to Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) to monitor the ceasefire
agreement. The border remained calm but for occasional tense confrontations
by local civilians and militia with UNMEE peacekeepers. In April 2002, the
Ethiopian government accused the UNMEE force commander of bias after he
drove foreign journalists into Badme from Eritrea, and refused to meet with him
thereafter. The U.N. replaced him in October.
The U.N. Emergencies Unit reported in February that some areas, notably in
eastern Tigray,were still uninhabitable due to the presence of landmines.While no
demining had started in Ethiopia, two demining companies were trained, and some
survey work had started. In April, after many months of prodding, Ethiopia provided
detailed maps of mines its forces had laid in Eritrea to UNMEE. There was a
significant decrease in deaths and injuries from landmines and unexploded ordinance
from the previous year. Nevertheless, from June to August alone, twelve
people were injured and four killed in eleven incidents.
Ethiopia obtained a measure of debt relief in 2002 from the World Bank and
Western countries in 2002, enough to save it U.S.$96 million in annual debt service
until 2021 if fully implemented. As part of the arrangement, Ethiopia would be
required to revise its tax structure, carry out privatization, cut defense spending,
and reorganize the banking sector.The promised debt relief represented only about
10 percent of Ethiopia’s estimated external debt burden of U.S.$10.3 billion.
United States
Ethiopia’s international standing grew during the year as its strategic location,
bordering Sudan and Somalia, made it a “frontline state” in the U.S.-led “war
against terrorism.” The U.S. provided substantial military assistance to Ethiopia
within this context.Yet the U.S. failed to press for accountability of Ethiopian security
forces accused of human rights violations, including the shooting of civilian
protestors. A senior state department official claimed that the U.S.wielded virtually
no leverage over Ethiopia because it was dependent on the country’s assistance in
rooting out al-Qaeda. U.S. economic and humanitarian assistance amounted to
about U.S.$170 million,one third of which represented funds for education, health,
and governance, and the remainder food and emergency aid.
European Union
The E.U. issued a statement in June condemning the violence in Tepi and Awassa
and demanding an inquiry into these events. The E.U. declined to provide police
assistance to the Ethiopian government to improve its ability to manage disturbances
with less than lethal force because it could not guarantee Ethiopia would use
such assistance responsibly (in the past, Ethiopia has misused assistance provided
to the police actually to commit human rights violations, including using a British
government-donated vehicle in the 1997 assassination of ETA leader Assefa Maru).
The E.U. and its member states provided about Û60 million (U.S.$59.1 million) in
humanitarian assistance during 2002.
