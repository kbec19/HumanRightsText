 PARAGUAY
 Paraguay has a tradition of authoritarian rule. The Presi-
 dent, General Alfredo Stroessner, has governed for over 23
 years. He is expected to be reelected to a new five-year
 term in February 1978. There have been cycles of repres-
 sion in Paraguay under President Stroessner. Recently
 there has been improvement in some aspects of the Government's
 human rights performance, but abuses continue. A major
 contributing factor to abuse is a state of siege which has
 been in force since 1947. During 1977, releases of political
 prisoners substantially exceeded new arrests, with the year
 end estimate of those still in custody below 200. However,
 19 Christian Trade Unionists were arrested in December.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Article 65 of the Constitution proscribes torture. A
 practice of police brutality and arbitrary arrest is well
 entrenched. Reports of torture--some credible, some un-
 verifiable--continue to be received. They usually refer
 to systematic mistreatment during an interrogation designed
 to elicit information or to undisciplined actions by in-
 dividual jailors. Government failure to enforce proper
 rules of conduct by the security forces serves to condone
 brutality.
 A 1976 report on the status of human rights in Paraguay
 by the International League for Human Rights (ILHR) con-
 tained the following paragraph:
 "Torture has undoubtedly been used. We talked to
 people who had been tortured. There are some docu-
 mented cases of people who have died under torture.
 The purpose of torture does not seem to have been,
 in general, to acquire information, but rather to
 force those submitted to it to confess, regardless
 of whether these confessions represented realities
 or fiction."
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The mistreatment of those in police custody sometimes
 includes cruel, inhuman and degrading acts. A September

 1977 Amnesty International publication refers to the use
 of the pleta, a tub filled with water into which a pri-
 soner is suerged head first.
 The Government of Paraguay has established a separate
 facility for political prisoners, thus removing them from
 the custody of local police. The 1977 ILHR report stated
 that while conditions at this facility were initially
 harsh, they have steadily improved.
 Although landowners occasionally kill Indians (and there
 was reportedly a mass killing of 20 Indians several years
 ago), charges of "genocide" against Paraguay appear to be
 false. Authorities can be charged with negligence for not
 enforcing the law and with considerable neglect of the
 Indians who suffer from poverty. A current study of the
 Ache Indians by Robert Smith of Kansas University appears
 to support the foregoing judgments.
 Official Government policy toward the Indian population
 calls for protection and gradual assimilation. More re-
 servation land has recently been allocated for the Indians
 and there have been public inspections of tribal areas.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Under Article 79 of the Constitution a state of siege has
 been imposed almost without interruption since 1929, and
 continuously since 1947. This allows for the indefinite
 detention of suspects without due process through the
 suspension of abridgment of individual guarantees. The
 state of siege which permitted arbitrary arrest and impri-
 sonment, is premised on the presence of a subversive threat
 to Paraguay's institutions but the very lenath of the state
 of siege and the climate of political st-bflity argue
 against the need for this extraordinary measure.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Executive has been reluctant to bring political or sub-
 versive prisoners before a court of law. In addition,
 the ILHR has found that there is an acute shortage of
 qualified judges. Resolution of a case can drag on several
 years because of crowded court calenders..
 Tne judicial process also suffers from interference with
 the ability of the defense to develope an adequate case.
 
 
 203
 The fairness of the judicial process for political pri-
 soners is adversely affected by restrictions for access
 to attorneys. Lawyers with clients in the Emboscada pri-
 son, have been allowed to visit prisoners only on family
 visiting days and have been denied privacy for discussion
 with defendants. Court and police records may not be
 readily available. The ILHR recently reported that the
 Minister of the Interior has promised "... an extra
 visiting day for attorneys and to permit notes, papers,
 and documents to be retained by attorneys . . "
 Prior to 1975 persons detained under state of siege pro-
 visions were rarely charged and tried. However, in Nov-
 ember 1976 some 45 detainees suspected of involvement in
 a group known as the Organizacion Politico-Militar (OPM)
 were charged under the anti-su~versive law. OP members
 reportedly received their training from the ERP of
 Argentina, one of the two groups most responsible for
 leftist terrorismin itht. cuntry.... As_.may_as_.L,0-0- per-
 sons may have been picked up for initial questioning re-
 garding the OPM in a wide-ranginï¿½ roundup in 1975 and
 1976. It is estimated that a sizeable number of these
 remain in jail among the approximately 200 political pri-
 soners. In July 1977 the Government also detained 17
 persons for alleged connection with the Communist Party
 and the OPM. Eleven of these have been released and
 the remaining six have been ordered to stand trial for
 subversion.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Invasions of the home occur usually in connection with
 investigation of supposed subversive activity. The state
 of siege provision of the Constitution Article 79, over-
 rides basic protections against arbitrary searches.
 3. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs .as Food, Shelter, Health Care, and
 Education
 In April 1977 the World Bank judged Paraguay's develop-
 ment strategy of agriculture and agroindustries to be
 well focused. All but 3% of Paraguay's exports are agri-
 cultural in origin. The World Bank indicated an economic
 growth rate of 7% during the 1972-1976 period.
 
 
 204
 In recent years donors have been'directing more attention
 to projects in the agricultural and health sector which
 will be of direct benefit to the poor. The Government
 of Paraguay has pushed infrastructure projects in trans-
 portation and an immense hydroelectric project which will
 supply relatively inexpensive energy on which industries
 can base their operations.
 A significant portion of Paraguay's population is still
 outside the money economy. According to the World Bank,
 60% of Paraguay's population lives in rural areas, and
 65% of that sector earns less than a poverty level in-
 come. The country depends on river and air transport,
 and a limited road system. When roads become available,
 the small farmers quickly take advantage of increases
 in world market prices, as was evidenced in 1977 when
 small farmers sharply increased their income with the
 production of cotton and tobacco.
 The Gbvernment is engaged in an active, ongofng home-
 steading and colonization program. Government-provided
 land now accommodates 21% of the rural population. As a
 result of this program and the efforts of the authorities
 to grant titles to poor farmers,.over 55% of farmers may
 now have title to at least part of their land. An analysis
 by the World Bank indicates expropriation of many large
 land holdings would not necessarily be beneficial because
 these holdings are most suited to extensive agriculture.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion, and
 Assembly
 Paraguay is largely free of religious and racial discrim-
 ination except for the problems mentioned with respect
 to the Indian population. Exceptions to the generally
 respected freedom of assembly occur in cases in which the
 Government suspects  subversion" or "Communist activity."
 On those grounds certain Jesuit cooperative development
 programs were harassed and closed in 1976 and several
 members of a welfare organization sponsored by the Dis-
 ciples of Christ were arrested. All but two persons of
 the latter group have been released.
 The Paraguayan Workers' Convention (CPT), representing
 over 90% of organized labor, is the only legally recog-
 nized union. It is under strict Government control.
 
 
 205
 Christian unions have been modestly active, particularly
 in rural areas, but have incurred Government displeasure.
 In theory, freedom of the press and speech are constitu-
 tionally guaranteed. Press criticism is tolerated within
 limits. Government programs may be criticized, but of-
 ficials may not. Self-censorship is practiced.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on movement within the country,
 provided an individual has a valid ID card. A persis-
 tent problem has been the refusal of the police to return
 I.D. cards to former detainees, or to issue them new ones.
 Foreign travel and emigration are not restricted as a
 rule and emigration has served as a safety valve for the
 unemployed. Certain former political prisoners have been
 sometimes prevented from traveling..abroad.--
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Paraguay has a long history of authoritarian government.
 President Stroessner, who has governed continuously since
 1954, is -ften credited with bringing "stability" to
 Paraguay, but at high cost to civil liberties.
 In the national elections of 1968 and 1973, the Colorado
 Party (Stroessner) received approximately 77% and 83%,
 respectively, of the total vote cast, although the poli-
 tical opposition asserts that many registered voters
 were turned away.
 There are two traditional political parties in Paraguay:
 the governing Colorado Party, which almost exclusively
 enjoys the political patronage of Government jobs, and
 the Liberals, who are split (the Government-dominated
 central election board ruled against an agreed merger
 that was approved in convention). A third legally recog-
 nized party, and the only one considered to be ideologi-
 cally oriented, is tne Febrerista Party. The Christian
 Democrats have yet to receiverecognition.
 Currently there are two regularly published opposition
 party biweeklies, and a third which appears sporadically,
 but these are subject to the restrictions on freedom of
 the press noted above.

 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rignts
 On several occasions the Government has allowed human
 rights groups to enter the country to meet with appro-
 priate officials and private citizens. Former Ambassador
 Stephansky has headed visits by two groups from the ILHR.
 His report on the first visit in 1976 was published by
 the ILHR and summarized in the Paraguayan press. The pur-
 pose of the second mission in 1977 was to conduct a study
 of the Paraguayan legal system.
 In 1977 Richard Arens, the editor of Genocide in Paraguay,
 accepted an invitation from the Paraguayan Government
 to examine firsthand the situation of the Ache Indians,-
 the subject of his book.
 The Government of Paraguay has agreed to permit a visit
 by-the--Iterx-meian" Human Rights Ccmmission soon after
 the February 1978 national elections.
