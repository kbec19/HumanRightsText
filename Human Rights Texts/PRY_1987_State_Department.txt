 PARAGUAY
 Paraguay has not had democratic government since its
 independence in 1811. President Alfredo Stroessner has ruled
 since 1954, dominating the military, the police forces, the
 government bureaucracy, and the ruling Colorado Party. His
 firm control over the party was reinforced-in the contentious
 August 1, 1987 party convention, when the more independent-
 minded traditionalist faction lost control of the party's
 governing board. The legislative and judicial branches of
 government are clearly subordinate to the power of the
 executive.
 National elections for the presidency and the legislature will
 be held in February 1988. The opposition's ability to conduct
 an effective campaign is severely restricted by the Government.
 Although two legally recognized opposition parties will
 participate, the Colorado Party's control over the election
 process has again induced most of the political opposition to
 boycott the electoral process. In the 1985 municipal
 elections, no opposition party candidate was credited with
 winning in any of the 190 municipalities. By law, however,
 the participating opposition parties share a third of the
 legislative and municipal council seats, no matter how small
 the total vote they receive in the elections.
 In 1986 the Paraguayan economy was buffeted by severe drought,
 which generated major recessionary pressures and a slump in
 exports. However, modest recovery occurred in 1987 as a
 result of improved weather and stronger international prices
 for Paraguay's key agricultural exports. While the Government
 has taken some steps over the past year to adjust exchange
 rates to more realistic levels, a continued, complex, multiple
 exchange rate system penalizes exporters, represents costly
 subsidies for public sector enterprises, and results in a
 misallocation of scarce economic resources.
 April 1987 witnessed the lapsing of the state of siege for the
 first extended period of time since 1929, the return of two
 well-known political exiles, a significant drop in the number
 of political detentions, and political rallies by the
 nonrecognized opposition in the interior, which drew crowds
 reportedly in excess of 10,000. These positive developments
 were reversed, however, after the militant faction took over
 the Colorado Party at the August convention, and significant
 violations of Constitutional civil and political liberties
 resumed. Arbitrary short-term detention of oppositionists,
 including dissident traditionalist Colorado Party members,
 increased substantially. The number of political detentions
 in the week prior to and the 2 weeks following the convention
 surpassed the total number of detentions during the preceding
 7 months.
 Government officials often ignored Constitutional provisions
 for protection of the integrity of the individual, the
 requirement for judicial warrants, freedom of assembly and
 association, the right to a judicial determination of the
 legality of detention, and the provision for a prompt and
 impartial trial. Opposition rallies were broken up and
 demonstrators beaten by police or Colorado Party supporters.
 Warrants were not issued for any of the 1987 political
 arrests, and a Significant number of those detained were held
 incommunicado without charges beyond the interval provided for
 in the Constitution. In August opposition activist Rafael
 Saguier was arrested and held for 4 months under a charge of
 sedition, allegedly for insulting the military in a panel

 discussion'and suggesting that democratiztion would come
 after President Stroessner's death. His detention recalls the
 similar arbitrary detention of his brother, Tito, for 4 1/2
 months in late 1986.
 Freedom of the press was further curtailed in 1987. The
 Ministry of Interior suspended publication of the nation's".
 only opposition newspaper, and Paraguay's most independent
 radio station closed after months of illegal jamming of its
 broadcast frequency and government pressure on advertisers to
 cancel their.-,ccounts. The Government has taken no action on
 a subsequent application by Radio" Nanduti owner Humberto Rubin
 to relicense the station. Threats',by official party organs
 against the r4maining print and broadcast media continued to
 spur self-censorship in the .press,

 As in previous ygprs-there  iere well-publicized and credible.
 charges of'toriture afid physical abuse by police or municipal
 officials in criminal cases, some of which resulted in death.
 The seriousness-of such allegations prompted police officials
 in Asuncion to denythat.Aortpie is commonly used in prisoner
 interrogations and to claimd that officers charged with torture
 are prosecuted under the law. Disciplinary action was taken
 in some abuse cases lei4ing to the reported imprisonment of
 police'officers. A Coronel Oviedo police officer,'who
 reportedly shbt and killed an innocent peasant in December
 1986, was frially charged and ordered imprisoned by a
 criminal juge. Seven police officers, held since February
 1985 in a beating and shooting death, were found guilty, and
 the prosebuting attorney asked for a 9-year sentence for the
 chief and 4 ;'2,years for his six subordinates.
 In January a 13 year-old died after he was allegedly tortured
 by police investigating the theft of bicycles. No known
 charges were filed against the police wh6 claimed the youth
 had attempted tb escape. In March charges were filed against
 three police officers for the death of a'man from Hernandarias.
 The court ordered the arrest of the three, but to date, the
 case has not been heard. Also in March, 'a police chief in
 Salto del Guaira. was charged with unnecessary force resulting
 in the death of a suspect. The disposition of the case is not
 known. I A9pril, afarmer was allegedly shot to death during
 a heated exchange with two soldiers and a police officer; no
 known charges have been filed. The press reported numerous
 other instances of torture by poliOc and other officials.

 Again this year, peasant organizations charged that military
 and police authorities illegally arrested and tortured
 landless farmers squatting on private or state-owned land.
 Three such dases, two involving squatters at Tavapy II and one
 involving landless peasants at Itakyry, were publicized.
 Since the 1986 shooting deaths of two peasants at Tavapy II,
 the military appear to have tried scrupulously to avoid
 involvement in violence against squatters, and these cases now
 appear to reflect principally police involvement.
 Reports that long-term prisoner Napoleon Ortigoza was being
 tortured, had been bricked into his cell, or was in need of
 urgent medical attention not being provided by prison
 authorities, appear to have been inaccurate. Archbishop Rolon
 saw Ortigoza prior to his release and publicly stated that
 Ortigoza was well and lucid. Ortigoza denied these reports in
 published interviews following his release in December from 25
 years' confinement.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is able to
 visit any prisoner with whom it requests an interview, although
 the Government does not always consent to Red Cross insistence
 on private interviews between their representatives and
 prisoners. Local judges, including the five Supreme Court
 Justices, also routinely visit local prisons to meet with and
 investigate the condition of prisoners. Paraguayan prisons
 are notably austere, and, without supplemental food from
 family or friends, prisoners could barely survive.
 Nevertheless, criminal detainees do enjoy some privileges such
 as meals shared with wives and children and conjugal visits.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Constitution provides for a judicial determination of the
 legality of detention and stipulates that any person arrested
 without a warrant must formally be presented before a judge
 and have charges filed against him within 48 hours of his
 detention. These constitutional provisions continue to be
 routinely ignored in 1987.
 According to public sources, 253 opposition political
 activists were arbitrarily detained and held at least
 overnight in 1987. An unknown but significant additional
 number were detained for several hours but were not
 incarcerated overnight. The 1987 arrest figure represents a
 net increase of 63 over 1986 detentions, which were twice the
 number of 1985. One hundred fifteen of the 253 were held less
 than 48 hours; 99 were held more than 48 hours but less than a
 week; 39 were held more than 7 days. No known arrest warrants
 were issued in any of the 253 cases, and formal charges''were
 filed in only 16 cases. Five law students, arrested without
 warrants on September 18, were held for 3 weeks following a
 campus confrontation between rival factions of the Colorado
 Party, on charges characterized as groundless by law school
 dean and Senate President Juan Ramon Chaves. The longest
 political detention of 1987 was that of Authentic Radical
 Liberal Party (PLRA) activist Rafael Saguier, who was arrested
 on August 29 and released December 23. He was charged with
 violating Law 209, i.e., sedition.
 The state of siege ordinance, the authority by which most
 political prisoners were held in 1986, was allowed to lapse on
 April 8, 1987, after having been in effect virtually
 continuously since 1929. Since the expiration of the state of
 siege, there are no known instances where the court has
 
 
 577
 PARAGUAY
 disqualified itself on habeas corpus petitions as had been the
 practice during the state of siege. Despite a sharp reduction
 in the number of:detainees immediately following the expiration
 of the ordinance, the number of political detainees in August
 and September exceeded any 2-month period in'the previous 2
 years while the state of siege remained in force. Arbitrary,
 short-term detention was used primarily against the political
 opposition including dissident Colorados. One hundred
 fifty-six of the detainees were held in connection with their
 opposition political activities., The labor movement composed
 the nekt largest grodpi-ng with 23 detainees id 1987.
 No person was exiled-in 1987. Two of those persons still in
 exile at the end of 1986 were allowed to return in 1987--
 D6midgoLaino on April 25 and Juan Carlos Galaverna on June
 17, both after several unsuccessful attempts to reenter'the
 country. The status of long-term exile poet Agusto Rao Bastos
 is uncler.- The'Govdrnment claims he is free to return., but
 he has"iade no attempt to do so. Justice and Labor Minister
 Eugenio Jacquet indicated in August that although the
 Constitution does not discuss the legality of exile as a means
 of punishment, it is nonetheless a legal right, established by
 its traditional use under various governments in Paraguayan
 history. Members of the illegal Paraguayan Communist Party in
 exile-,have not returned to Paraguay, probably fearing
 imprisonment were they to do so.
 Forced labor is prohibited, and it is not practiced.
 ei- D-nibl of a Fair Public Trial
 Trials are conducted almost exclusively by presentation of
 writteh documents to a judge, who then renders a decision.
 The adcused often appears before the court only twice--to
 plead and t6 hear sentencing. All judgments are automatically
 reviewed by an appellate'judge, 'and appeals to the Supreme
 Court are-possiblet Part of both civil and criminal
 -proceedings are open 'to the public'and are often reported in
 the piress: However,-court proceedings in cases of a sensitive
 political nature are heldin camera, and subsequent press
 reports ate based only on the attorney's or judge's comments.
 The Constitution and thepenal code provide numerous safeguards
 to protect the rights of-individuals. However, the judiciary
 remains subordinate to the executive branch. Executive
 influence i  exerdised thtough the presidential appbintment of
 judges, control over the judiciary's budget, and through
 political;tpartj'discipline' A prominent lower court criminal*
 judge-resigned in.Septdmber citing his refusal to accede to
 demands from the executive in cases assigned him.
 Executive"interference, administrative shortcomings, and the
 lack of adequate financial support for the judicial system can
 limit the right of an accused to a fair, speedy trial. Prison
 authorities at the National Penitentiary at Tacumbu recently
 stated that 94 percent of those imprisoned had not yet been
 sentenced. Many accused serve the normal time prescribed for
 the crime for which they are accused and are released without
 ever having their trial proceedings completed. The widespread
 perception that judicial protection depends on political,
 military, or economic power engenders sufficient fear to
 prevent most citizens from confronting political or police.
 authority.
 
 
 578
 PARAGUAY
 Efforts to improve the image of the judiciary included the
 suspension of a judge in Ciudad Stroessner for failure to act
 in a timely manner on a case involving a police officer charged
 with torturing to death a prisoner in his custody. A second
 judge was suspended for allegedly extorting $50 from a
 defendant in a case he was hearing.
 Two cases involving convicted prisoners of international
 notoriety were subjects of judicial review in 1987. Rafael
 Mella Latorre, convicted in 1980 as an accomplice in the death
 of Anastasio Somoza and sentenced to 6 years in prison, has
 not been released. Authorities maintain he is now being held
 in connection with his alleged participation in a prison riot
 in January 1986. Mella, and others accused in the riot, began
 pleadings in the new case in October 1987, 1 year and 10 months
 after the event. Napoleon Ortigoza, held in solitary
 confinement since being convicted in 1963 for the murder of a
 military cadet, was released on December 20. Following his
 release, Ortigoza was ordered to a provincial town for 30 days.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 While government and security forces generally do not
 interfere in the private lives of most citizens, there are
 notable exceptions. Although private homes are
 constitutionally protected from entry except with a judicial
 warrant or to prevent a crime, this protection has been
 ignored in practice. On February 11, Asuncion police launched
 a tear-gas grenade into the garden of a private residence
 where a small group had gathered, before a police cordon was
 established, for a dinner in honor the U.S. Ambassador. The
 police claimed that the gas entered the garden accidentally
 although. the tear gas grenade was launched from close range
 and landed close to the Ambassador, an Embassy officer, and
 their hosts. On April 12, police broke into a private home in
 an Asuncion suburb to disrupt a meeting and arrest seven
 leaders of the PLRA. Other party leaders escaped over a
 garden wall. According to press accounts and statements by
 the home owner, the police did not have search or arrest
 warrants. The police stated that they were halting an
 unauthorized political meeting. No charges were filed against
 the seven men who were held for 1 day and then released. On
 August 30, police entered the home of the hospital workers'
 leader, Hector Lacognata, without a warrant. Police claimed
 they had orders to. arrest Lacognata, but, in fact, 'did not
 arrest him. On October 7, police entered a private home in an
 Asuncion suburb without a warrant and arrested 17 leaders of
 the PLRA. The 17 were taken to a local police station and
 released an hour later.
 There are credible reports that security forces routinely
 intercept and open private mail and monitor private telephone
 conversations. Some political opponents and independent labor
 leaders have been unable to obtain municipal services, such as
 telephone and water utilities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press suffered further reversals in
 1987. Despite broad constitutional assurances of freedom of
 speech and press, in practice the.Government will tolerate
 only limited amounts and kinds of criticism. Direct criticism
 
 
 579
 PARAGUAY
 of the President or members of his family, the military, and
 key civiri-an leaders are avoided by the major print and
 broadcast media. Some observers believe that El Pueblo,
 Paraguay's only opposition party newspaper, apparently
 exceeded those constraints. Owned and operated by the legally
 recognized Reyolutionary Febrerista Party (PRF), El Pueblo had
 reached a weekly circulation of 45,000 before it was suspended
 by a Ministry of Interior. order on August 28. The Government
 subsequently sought'and obtained a court order- to legalize the
 closure. The independent pewspaper ABC Color, suspended by
 government order in March 1984, remained closed. A government
 permit .is required to publish a newspaper; at least two
 applictibns for such permits were denied in 1987. Six
 joVrnallsts'were arbitrarily detained in 1987 and 3 were
 beat~n by police or Colorado vigilantes during the arrest
 process.
 Radio Nanduti, an independent radio station, suspended its
 broadcasts on Januaryo14, following months of illegal jamming
 of its .authorized frequency. Written appeals to the courts
 and to the National Telecommunications Administration,
 responsible for. protecting airwave rights, were denied. The
 illegal jamming, which originally blocked out news and public
 information programs, was expanded to include commercial
 announcements, and eventually blocked the Radio Nanduti AM
 signal during virtually all of its air time. The ruling
 Colorado 'arty is clearly identified with a parallel campaign
 to drive adib Nanduti off the air by intimidating the
 station's'advertisers. The.Government prohibited jhe weekly
 SundaVbroadcass of Catholic church services in the four
 interidr. tQwhs of Pilar, San Pedro,. San Estanislao and
 Concepcion. In Concepcion the broadcasts were. later allowed
 to resume. A press conference planned by Freedom House
 representatives at Radio Nanduti was prohibited by the
 Government, The closing press conference of the Interamerican
 Press Association scheduled to take place at the editorial
 officpsbt the clgsed newspaper'ABC -plor, and a follow up
 conference at the hotel','were.simiarly brohibited.
 Othei independent media outlets received strongly worded
 warnbnisand thinly veiled threats either printed in the
 C61o6ado :'arty's official daily newspaper, La-Patria, or
 broadcast in its daily national radio program. Editors-of the
 more independent media, such as Radio Caritaq, Radio' Primero
 de Marzo, and the nqwspaper Ultima Hora, deny that they
 consciously exercise self-censorship over their news reporting.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association'
 The rigbts. of peaceful assembly and association, though
 provided'for by the'Constitution, were~regularly violated in
 practice. Despite the expiration of state of siege provisions
 requiring a permit for any public gathering in excess of five
 persons, the police routinely insisted on prior authorization
 for any.meeting involving the political opposition, labor, or
 students. -This provision was not enforced, for members in good
 standing of the Colorado Party, the cooperative opposition, or
 in cases involving nonpolitical groups.
 On January 2, 1987 the United States announced a decision to
 suspend Paraguay's beneficiary status in the U.S. Generalized
 System of Preferences (GSP) program because Paraguay was found
 not to be in compliance with the requirements in the GSP
 statute regarding .internationally recognized worker rights".
 
 
 580
 PARAGUAY
 The decision followed a review of allegations of Paraguayan
 practices denying freedom of association for labor unions and
 harassment of union leaders.
 During early 1987 the Government selectively permitted a
 number of political opposition and labor gatherings that in
 previous years were forbidden. The nonrecognized parties,
 particularly the PLRA, were permitted to hold rallies; the
 Inter-Syndical Workers Movement (MIT) staged a public May 1
 Labor Day rally in a downtown Asuncion plaza; and the April 24
 initial launching of the Independent University Student
 Movement (FEUP) was approved and was not impeded by police.
 However, the PLRA soon experienced problems, and police began
 blocking and repressing meetings and beating and arresting the
 organizers. An MIT picnic was prohibited in August and iits
 leader arrested, and a September rally of the FEUP was blocked
 by police.
 In a particularly noteworthy example of governmental
 suppression of political and labor opposition, a September
 opposition/labor panel discussion in a Catholic Church
 parochial meeting hall in Coronel Oviedo was violently broken
 up by Colorado Party vigilantes interspersed in the audience.
 Armed with chains, cables, and truncheons, as well as a few
 pistols, and led by the Colorado ward vice president, the
 militant party supporters attacked the panelists as well as
 the parish priest who attempted to intercede to stop the
 violence. Rather than condemning this vigilantism, the
 Minister of Justice and other government authorities lauded
 the action. PLRA meetings were prohibited, prevented, and
 disrupted in the interior and the capital, in open public
 spaces, meeting halls, private clubs, and even private homes,
 and its leaders beaten on several occasions.
 Other opposition groups suffered similar treatment. Police
 blocked a commemorative Mass organized by the Popular Colorado
 Movement (MOPOCO) in May and denied access to the cathedral
 and entry of the officiating priest. The public launching of
 a new political group, the Popular Democratic Movement (MDP),
 scheduled to be held in the Radio Nanduti auditorium in July,
 was prohibited by police. On five separate occasions, peaceful
 political protests called civil assemblies, organized by the
 PRF in crowded public areas in Asuncion, were broken up by
 police using excessive force. A number of oppositionists,
 students, and reporters were beaten by police.
 Student and cultural groups suffered similar treatment.
 Following a March 22 memorial Mass commemorating the closure
 of the newspaper ABC Color, attended by U.S. religious press,
 the Ambassador, and Brazilian parliamentarians, police beat
 placard-bearing students in front of the Metropolitan
 Cathedral. In April a law school student rally was violently
 broken up by police, and five students were arrested.
 Students at the National Theological Seminary were brutally
 beaten when they attempted to leave their campus in a
 "Stations of-the Cross" march to demonstrate support for the
 'release of the five law students and to protest government
 policies.
 Throughout the year police engaged in antilabor activities.
 They barricaded entrances to halls retained for meetings by
 the Construction Workers Union (SINATRAC) and the Commercial
 Workers Union (SEOC), prevented elections by the union of a
 cotton and vegetable oil processing plant (CAPSA) and a
 meeting of a journalists union (SPP), refused permission for
 
 
 581
 PARAGUAY
 education workers to meet and organize, and violently broke up
 a march by health workers at-the Asuncion Hospital de Clinicas
 and beat several doctors. Various union leaders were arrested
 on numerous occasions, specifically Victor Baez, President of
 FETRABAN, and leader of MIT who was arrested twice, Elsa Mereles
 and Carlos Filizzola of the Hospital de Clinicas, Pedro
 Salcedo, Secretary Genera- of the Cotton Workers Union
 (CAPSA)i~and Gregorio-Ojeda, Secretary General of the-
 Construction Workers Union (SINATRAC).
 Beginning in September police lines systematically blocked
 public panel debates sponsored by-Radio Nanduti, which were to
 -have been held-in the.-station's auditorium. Police spokesmen
 denied that-the panels were prohihited and explained that only*
 entrance by nonstation personnel (including the panelists) was
 forbidden.         -
 The governmeht-linked Confederation of Paraguayan Workers
 (CPTI-represents most recognized labor unions, but is clearly
 not- independent and-makes only pro forma efforts-to defend
 workers'-interests. The right-to strike, while recognized
 under Paraguayan-labor law, is virtually impossible to
 exercise-due tolthe complex legal process of fact finding,
 -arbitration, and adjudication .required before a strike can be
 considered legal..
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Romanfatholicism is zthe predominant and official religion in
 . Paraguay, but the Constitution provides freedom of conscience
 -for other denominations. Thisfreedom is-respected. Adherence
 to a particular creed confers no. automatic advantage, and
 conversion from one faith to another is permitted. Foreign
 and local,missionaries proselytize openly, and a number of
 Protestant groups have achieved marked growth in the number of
 their-adherents. -, The. Jehovah's Witnesses lost their legal.
 status in 1979.  An appeal filed with the Supreme Court on the
 right oE Jehovah~s Witnesses.children to abstain from    . .
 participation in mandatory patriotic observances in public
 schoo1s was decided in-July against the children. The-Court
 ruled that.constitutional-prQvisions requiring veneration of
 the national symbols overrode~provisio s .establishing the
 right to education'fox all citizens. Despite the church's
 lack of'status, the Government has not moved against church
 property.      -  -.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 TraV.el, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Most Paraguayan'citizens travel freely with virtually no
 restrictions on their-freedom of movement, but there are
 periodic-and random road-blocks established on rural roads to
 verify possession of national and voter registration cards and
 current payment of registration fees. Those citizens who do
 not oppose the Government may enter and leave the country
 without'restriction. However, the Government restricted the
 travel of a number of citizens active in the political
 opposition or in labor movements in 1987. Humberto Rubin,
 owner of Radio Nanduti, was prohibited from leaving Paraguay
 on two occasions in 1987--in February, as he departed for a
 socialist convention in Spain, and in May, when heattempted
 to travel to-the United States to speak at a seminar sponsored
 by the National-Endowment for Democracy. Rubin's passport was
 seized when he tried to leave in February and has not been
 returned. He was told that he is prohibited from traveling
 
 
 582
 PARAGUAY
 due to unresolved charges pending against him under the
 political offenses statutes, despite the presiding judge's
 rejection of that argument.
 Two labor leaders at the National Teaching Hospital--Nurses'
 Union President Elsa Mereles and Doctors' Union President
 Carlos Filizzola--have applied for passports and repeatedly
 been unable to obtain them. The identity documents of other
 political and labor leaders have been confiscated, and some
 have been subsequently arrested for failure to produce
 identification at police checkpoints.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 President and General Alfredo Stroessner dominates the
 Paraguayan political scene. He exercises political control
 over the executive, legislative, and judicial branches through
 the Colorado Party, which administers public patronage, and
 through the military and police forces, which maintain public
 order. The ruling party's two-thirds majority in the Senate
 and the Chamber of Deputies gives the Colorados complete
 control of the legislature. There has been no recent occasion
 when the legislative branch has rejected any significant
 presidential proposal or adopted any significant.proposal by
 the legislative opposition. By statute, the legislature
 includes a one-third opposition presence, currently divided
 among the two opposition parties that participate in national
 elections. Their legislative presence exceeds the combited 10
 percent of the vote they are credited with in recent
 elections. They can express their views and criticize the
 Government but have no real power.
 General elections, held every 5 years for the presidency and
 the legislature, will next be held in February 1988.
 Municipal elections, last held in 1985, also occur nationwide
 every 5 years. The law requires that all Paraguayans between
 18 and 60 years of age vote. However, sanctions for not
 voting are rarely applied except against public service
 employees. One of the legally recognized opposition parties
 (the PRF) does not participate in elections, claiming that
 government control over the political process makes such
 participation meaningless. The nonrecognized opposition
 groups, the PRF's partners in the National Accord (the
 Christian Democratic Party (PDC), the PLRA and the MOPOCO),
 also practice nonparticipation for the same reason.
 Restrictions on the activities of opposition political
 parties, the system of indirect selection of candidates, and
 the control of the electoral machinery by the dominant
 Colorado Party constitute a seriously flawed electoral
 process. Secret balloting provisions are frequently not
 respected. Votes reportedly are counted at times without the
 presence of an opposition or impartial poll watcher. In
 recent elections, in some jurisdictions, the Colorado Party
 finished with more votes than the number of registered
 voters. Speaking in defense of the generosity of the Colorado
 Party during elections, President Stroessner said publicly
 that the number of votes of the participating opposition is
 sometimes inflated by the Colorado vote counters.
 Nevertheless, since the opposition began participating in
 elections in 1963, they have won only one municipal
 election--in the first such contest, and reportedly by
 error--among the country's 190 municipalities.

 Hence, Colorado Party membership is the essential criterion
 for employment in the government, including the judiciary, the
 teaching and administrative staffs of public schools

 national steel dbmPany, and the security services. Following

 Sectin'5 DisCriminition Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The common unifying elements in 'Paraguayan culture are its
 Roman'CaHolicism and its Guarani-language roots. While
 social-stratification exists, and there is only very limited
 social mixing; there ii some social mobility and'no clear

 evidence of discrimination based on race, religion, or
 language. Particularly in political or military circles,
 nonfluency in Guarani and a lack of ties to peasant or rural
 origins is considered a severe handicap.
 The Constitution provides for "the equality of civil and
 political rights of women," but women, in fact, play a minor
 role in political life. The executive and judicial branches
 of government have few prominent female officials. There are
 two women in the 90-member legislature. While the traditional
 social system limits the participation of women, they have
 long been economically active, particularly those from lower
 income groups, and increasing numbers are participating in
 business, the professions, and the artistic world. Women
 usually receive less remuneration than men for comparable
 work. There are two organizations concerned with women's
 rights--an auxiliary organization of the Colorado Party, and
 the Union of Paraguayan Women (UMPA), an organization founded
 in 1982 by a former opposition national deputy. A new
 organization, Women for Democracy, was formed in 1987. It
 includes professional and politically active women from a
 broad political spectrum, but none involved in or with the
 Government.
 Paraguay has an unassimilated Indian population estimated at
 between 75,000 and 100,000. The Government's National
 Indigenous Institute can purchase land on behalf of the
 Indians and can expropriate private property under certain
 conditions to establish tribal homelands. In 1987, there were
 two well-publicized cases of private land expropriated on
 behalf of indigenous groups. The Government also actively
 encourages church groups to work with indigenous populations
 for health and welfare, as well as religious ends. The
 problems of the indigenous population continue to receive
 frequent publicity in the Paraguayan media.
 The Government has investigated reports of massacres or
 murders involving members of the indigenous tribes. A report
 in December of the massacre of eleven Pai Indians was quickly
 investigated, and a number of suspects in the case were
 arrested. On December 15, when eight of the missing Indians
 were found unharmed, it appeared that no massacre took place,
 and the suspects were released.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Paraguayan labor code provides minimum guarantees of
 worker rights and benefits. Public sector, temporary, and
 domestic workers are not covered under this law. According to
 the code, maximum hours are set at 8 hours per day or 7 hours
 for night work, with 1 day of rest per week. A minimum wage
 is established by the labor authority depending on the type of
 work and the region, based on studies of the cost of living
 prepared by the National Economic Coordinating Committee. The
 law provides for a 1-month annual bonus. Minors between 15
 and 18 years of age may be employed only with parental
 authorization and cannot be employed in dangerous or unhealthy
 conditions. For children between 12 and 15 years of age,
 there is a restriction that work be in a family enterprise, an
 apprenticeship, or agriculture. Married women require their
 husband's consent to enter a labor contract; however, labor
 contracts may not be denied to women who worked prior to
 marriage. Paid maternity leave of 6 weeks prior to and after
 birth is required. Day care centers for children under 2
 years of age are mandatory for enterprises employing more than

 50 women. Severance pay is specified and compensation is
 provided for in cases of unjustified dismissal.
 The labor code also governs conditions of safety, hygiene, and
 comfort.- The absence of a strong independent trade union
 movement, and the slowness and relative expense of the labor
 law system to adjudicate cases, result in the frequent failure
 to provide the protections of the labor code.
