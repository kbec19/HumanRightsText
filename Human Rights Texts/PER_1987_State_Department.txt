 PERU
 Peru has a freely elected democratic government, with an
 executive branch headed by a president, a bicameral
 legislature, an independent judiciary, and an autonomous
 attorney general. Peru's history has been punctuated by
 periods of military rule, most recently between 1968 and
 1980. President Alan Garcia and his American Popular
 Revolutionary Alliance (APRA) won the last general elections
 in 1985 by a large margin. General elections are next
 scheduled for 1990. Political representation in Congress
 ranges from conservative to Marxist. Independent trade unions
 are active. Freedom of speech and press generally are
 respected, and the media often criticize the Government.
 Peru has a mixed economy, and private property is generally
 respected. Natural disasters, low commodity prices, and
 terrorism have taken their toll on the economy. In spite of
 renewed growth in 1986 and 1987, per capita income is no
 higher than it was 20 years ago.
 Since 1980, the Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) Maoist
 guerrillas have used terror to undermine democracy. Rejecting
 calls for dialog and lacking widespread popular support,
 Sendero regularly has assassinated local officials, APRA party
 members, police and soldiers, and ordinary citizens who
 withhold support. In 1987 Sendero stepped up activities in
 coca-producing areas, demanding protection money from coca
 producers and attacking narcotics police. Sendero also
 increased its assassinations of APRA and government officials.
 Although not alone in committing abuses, Sendero is a major
 human rights violator and bears heavy responsibility for the
 rise in violence in Peru. In addition, two other smaller
 terrorist groups contributed to increased violence.
 The military leads the effort to combat subversion outside
 Lima. The number of provinces (in addition to Lima and Callao)
 under a state of emergency increased to 34 in November (out of
 a total of 181) and remain at that level. These states of
 emergency place all executive-branch authority in the local
 military command, suspend restrictions on arbitrary detention
 and search warrants, and restrict rights to movement and
 assembly. The history of military coups has limited civilian
 control over the armed forces. There is little oversight of
 military activities in the emergency zones by civilian judges
 or prosecutors, and the constitutional rights of persons
 detained by the military are usually ignored. Three police
 services, which report to the Interior Ministry, have the
 primary counterterrorist role in Lima and other cities.
 Under the previous administration, counterterrorist operations
 resulted in widespread human rights violations. Reports of
 summary executions by the security forces dropped in 1987, but
 only after the military restricted journalists' access to the
 Ayacucho emergency zone. The Public Ministry, an independent
 body with constitutional responsibility to promote criminal
 prosecutions and protect human rights, reported 120 complaints
 in 1987 of disappearances allegedly carried out by the security
 forces, of which only 20 were resolved. Human rights groups
 believe many of the remainder were summarily executed, and
 such conclusions appear to be well founded. Public Ministry
 prosecutors have made credible charges regarding the use of
 torture by government entities, to which the Government has
 not responded. In 1987 the Government withdrew permission for
 the International Committee of the. Red Cross (ICRC) to visit
 key prison and detention centers. Trials of military personnel

 accused of human rights.violations (there are five currently
 in progress) move very slowly,. .That of Commander Artaza is
 postponed indefinitely due to the defendant's disappearance.
 Human rights groups charge that the military is deliberately
 stalling the remainder.. -    *
 Positive developments in-1987 included the creation of a
 prestigious-congressional commission to investigate the 1986
 prison-killings- and revisionof the antiterrorism law to
 require that suspects be interrogated only in the presence of
 a Public Ministry prosecutor and w-defense attorney. Human
 rights, groups say the law gdverning-police interrogation of
 terrQvist-suspects is usually observed in Lima, but much less
 so in other areas.      -                      "
 Several developmtentsin 1987 caused.concern that elements of
 the.governing APRA party-were using violence against suspected
 terrorists aridpolitical opponents. These included afailed -
 bombing against a proterrorist.newspaper; an alleged kidnaping-
 attempt against a leftist congressman; and press reports of-
 police seizures .ofAPRA arsenals. The Government and APRA
 deny,..iny 34rongdoing. -
 In Deremier,1987., Americas- Watch published a report that
 expressed several concerns. While acknowledging that-the
 Government ljas had to confront the Sendero insurgency, and-
 that the Government does ,not engage in human rights abuses as-
 a matter of policy, the report criticizes the Government for
 passility in not pursuing a more vigorous program to end such
 abuzes.- The'Government' was citicized for the'lack of  ,
 inqstigationN into -buses committed by the security forces,
 especially the lack of.-progress in the investigations of the
 1986 pxiso. riots.-

 Section 1 -Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 S-  -  Freedom from:-      :,
 a. Political Killing
 Politicalkillings remained a.significant problem in 1987.
 Rejecting dialog and seeking-the overthrow of democracy,
 Sendero, Luminoso continued to assassinate policemen,'soldiers,
 government and ruling party officials, as well as recalcitrant
 peasants:.3.etween January and November 1987, Sendero killed
 612 .persons, according to the research organization DESCO; due
 to the, isolation of many rural areas where Sendero is most
 active,-the number of victims almost surely is underreported.
 In th)Jezcountryside,. Sendero used violence, particularly
 assassinations,.to impose its.control in certain areas, to
 punish sorcalled "traitors," and to eliminate sources of
 opposition. In the cities, Sendero used assassinations more
 for propaganda purposes. Particularly noteworthy was the
 increase during 1986 and 1987 in Sendero killings of government
 and party (APRA)-officials. Sendero killings in 1987 included
 the -anuary execution of.3 peasants in Ayacucho Department who
 participated- in a government employment program; the April
 ambush of an army bus in Huancavelica Department in which 10
 soldiers and 4 civilians died; the April attack with automatic
 weapons against a Lima restaurant in which 3 army officers and
 5,bystanders died; the August assassination of the Prefect of
 Apurimac.Department, along with his 12-year-old son; the
 killing in August of Rodrigo Franco, President of the
 government food corporation ENCI, witnessed by his family; the
 
 
 588
 PERU
 September killings of 14 peasants in an Ayacucho village; the
 October assassination of a government party official; and the
 murder in December of 3 development officials in Ayacucho.
 In addition to Sendero, a smaller terrorist group, the Tupac
 Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), killed two policemen in
 April 1987. In alliance with the companion Movement of the
 Revolutionary Left (MIR), it carried out numerous bombing
 attacks against public buildings and diplomatic installations
 that claimed the life of one civilian and wounded several
 others. With the advent of MRTA rural operations, that
 organization has killed as many as 20 soldiers in San Martin
 Province. A MRTA leader stated in a December interview that
 some of the soldiers died from mines laid by the MRTA.
 The Government claims to have killed approximately 4,200
 alleged terrorists since 1983, including approximately 310 in
 1987. This is much lower than the 1986 total of 813, which
 included approximately 250 imprisoned Sendero members.
 Casualties in remote areas likely are underreported by the
 military, and probably include a large but unknown number of
 captured terrorists and innocent civilians summarily executed
 by the security forces. The Government acknowledged in 1985
 and 1986 that summary executions had cost the lives of about
 200 persons. In 1987 the senior public prosecutor in Lima
 accused the armed forces and civil guard of directing
 inhabitants of Uchuraccay in January 1983 to massacre 8
 journalists.
 Peruvian human rights groups have agreed that there has been a
 drop in reported summary executions since 1985 and have brought
 forward few specific accusations of such executions in 1987.
 They expressed concern, however, that this drop reflects, at
 least in part, government efforts to hide abuses. Following a
 media expose in 1986 of summary executions in Ayacucho, the
 Ayacucho military command in 1987 sharply decreased
 journalists' access to areas where fighting was heaviest. The
 effect was to reduce independent observers' ability to monitor
 abuses.
 Human rights groups were also concerned about the lack of
 punishment for members of the military accused of participation
 in summary executions. Even in cases where the Government has
 acknowledged that executions occurred (Accomarca and Pucayacu
 in 1985, Lurigancho prison, Pomatambo, and Parcco in 1986), no
 military personnel have yet been convicted of wrongdoing. The
 congressional commission charged with investigating the Parcco/
 Pomatambo executions never reached the site of the killings.
 The Ayacucho political-military command refused to provide
 helicopter support to the commission (claiming other demands)
 and said the military could not vouch for the commission's
 safety if it traveled by road. The commission decided not to
 visit Parcco and Pomatambo under these conditions.
 After a 1-year delay, in August the government majority in
 Congress named a .commission headed by a respected leftist
 .opposition leader to investigate the 1986 prison uprising, in
 which about 250 prisoners died. Of the approximately 95
 policemen originally detained in connection with the summary
 executions at the prisons, only 15, including 3 officers,
 remain in custody. The commission's extensive minority report
 blamed the government for using force too soon and in excessive
 amounts, failing to observe legal requirements, and concealing
 evidence. It concluded that several top officials should be
 tried for their responsibility. The majority report, approved
 
 
 589
 PERU
 by the APRA-contFolled Congress, acknowledged excesses but
 exoferated top officials. In a special report on the prison
 killings whch Amnesty'International (AI) released in February
 1987, Al chargei3.hat there had-been "a deliberate cover-up of
 the events-by civilian, as well as by military, authorities,
 which hded-to hide the'notorious violations of human rights."
 The. military justice code contains no provision for dealing
 with-cases Of killing,.kidnaping, or torture--pnly "negligence"*
 and "abuse. pf authoiiiy." Legislation to correct this
 shortcomi~ng passed the Senate in 1986 but has" not yet passe-

 Human rights groups have estimated that there were   -
 approximately' 200 unresolved disappeaiance cases for 1987.
 Most involved alleged detentions of individuals suspected of
 terrorism by the.armed forces-i)a the-Ayacucho emergency zone.
 About 20 of tfiepersons reported to have disappearedturned up
 alive in police custody. Human rights groups charge that the
 remainder were summarily executed-by the security forces. The
 boSiOsb.dsapparance0vietims~are rarely found. Based on.
 testimQ l by survivors of disappearances, it appears that most
 disappearance victims are taken to military bases for
 interrQoation. Some are turned over to the police after'long
 detentions'and .afterwards are freed for lack of incriminating
 evidifice", ',Human rights groups argue persuasively that the
 rest are summarily executed by the armed forces.
 A December 1986,report.by the United Nations Human Rights
 Commigsion UNHRC)' Working Group on Forced or Involuntary
 Disappearances noted that "although there were fewer cases,
 the structures thit" permitted disappearances to occur remained
 intact, and the number of persons released after having been
 held in unacknowledged-detention was still considerable."
 
 
 590
 PERU
 Although most disappearances occur in rural areas, they have
 spread to Lima as well. Jose Vasquez Huayca, a lawyer who
 defended accused terrorists, disappeared in October 1986 and
 has not been seen since. Reliable observers claim that an
 eyewitness saw Vasquez detained by the security forces in the
 Palace of Justice just before his disappearance. Although the
 Government has stated that Mr. Vasquez is not in detention,
 his family claims that other detainees reportedly saw Vasquez
 in the cells of the Anti-Terrorism Directorate of the
 investigatory police. In February 1987, university student
 Angel Perez Ali reportedly disappeared following police
 detention of nearly 800 Lima students after a nighttime raid
 on Lima universities. In May 1987, a newspaper reported the
 capture of alleged Sendero member Santiago Castillo Cavero.
 Castillo was never seen again, and the police deny he was ever
 captured. In October APRA youth leader Jaime Bedon was
 arrested for trying to detain at gunpoint a Marxist
 congressman. He was subsequently released and was dropped
 from his party position because of the attempt. In October
 there were allegations that Carmen Rosa Rodriguez (a member of
 the pro-Sendero "Committee of Family Members of Prisoners of
 War") disappeared after a visit to Canto Grande prison; the
 -police deny she was ever detained.
 The Public Ministry sent - special prosecutor, Carlos Escobar,
 to Ayacucho in July to investigate the.disappearances of 142
 persons in 1987, of which 45 persons were alie (three had
 died). Although the reappearance of disappearance victims was
 more common in 1987 than before, Escobar's efforts may well
 have contributed to the finding-of some of the victims before
 they disappeared for good. In addition, Escobar's report
 critical of military human rights practices is a departure from
 the normal practice of the Public Ministry. The military's
 refusal to permit the Public Ministry, judges, or other
 civilian agency officials access to military detention centers
 remains aimajor obstacle, as well as the absence of vigorous
 prosecution of persons accused of carrying out disappearances.
 .No member of the security forces has ever been convicted of
 participating in a disappearance. The trial of Navy officer
 Alvaro Artaza, accused of the'disappearance in 1964 of
 journalist Jaime Ayala, was suspended in 1986 when Artaza
 dropped from-sight, reportedly with Navy consent. The
 Governeent claimed it was unable to locate him in 1987,
 although Artaza somehow managed to file a legal plea before
 the Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal in 1987.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture and inhuman or humiliating
 treatment. Nevertheless, charges of brutality toward detainees
 are common. In February a senior Public Ministry prosecutor
 claimed that police probably had tortured or mistreated many
 of the 800 students detained during a police sweep. Human
 rights groups claim that suspected subversives are routinely
 tortured at military detention centers and at the police
 antiterrorism unit's (Dircote) detentio facility. Lawyers
 and other persons familiar with the police and judicial system
 concur in these charges. In September, the Public Ministry's
 special prosecutor in Ayacucho Department declared that the
 majority of persons recently detained by the military, who
 were usually held incommunicado, showed signs of mistreatment
 or torture. The Government has not responded to these charges.
 A commission appointed by the Minister of the Interior to
 inyestigate the charges of torture of 10 peasants in Cuzco in
 
 
 591
 PERU
 November 1,986 r.eporte. that the 10 dekainees were held beyond
 the legal limits imposed by the law and that they were tortured
 by the police while' n detention. The. report indicates'that
 the'illegal. 4ete6hions and, torture were carried out with the
 knowledge qf th e prefect And the public.prosecutor of Cuzco
 and'named the men. epponsible. Charges wee filed against the
 policemen allegedli tespon ible for the Cuzco torture case;
 the trial has, not.-coclpede .  .       .      '
 The"new -terrorism lit's requirement that persons detained for
 terrorism be interrogated only in the presence of a lawyer is
 viewed as A pgsitive development. Human rights groups noted
 with concern the. pclusibn of the ICRC from prisons and police
 faci1ties In the Ayacuchoemergency zone, beginning in  -
 January, and theo.C  s exclusion, be~inning in April;-'from
 Dircote.'s Ima'deteni on'center.
 Many of Seneros, mueder,.victims showed signs of having been
 tortured before death, reportedly sometimes following a mock
 trial. Examples include: the torture and killing of 7
 narcotics traffickers in San Martin department in April; the
 torture and kiiling of an army sergeant in Lima in July; and,
 the reported burying alive of'l0 peasants in Ayacucho in
 August. In addition, there were credible- reports that Sendero
 frequently beat and tortured peasants who had withheld their
 Prjppk cnditions are.,ppor, and prisoners are likely to
 encountpiiitid'hygienic facilities, poor nutrition and
 health-,car6 , and 'll treatment,by prison staff. During the
 prisof-repxganilzation, it-was discoyered that many.prison
 guards ha' drininal backgrounds. Approximatply 350 prison
 guards reportedly will be fired-under the reorganization.

 defense attorney. The new law also requires that police
 notify the detainee's family and human rights groups of the
 arrest. There is no bail or provisional liberty for persons
 accused of terrorism. The-increase in terrorism in Lima
 (which, though under a state of emergency, is governed by the
 civilian authorities) has been accompanied by an increase in
 temporary detentios_. In February, nearly.800 university
 students were detained during a sweep of 3 Lima university
 campuses; fewer than 10 of the students were eventually
 charged.. By January 1988, all the cases had been dismissed
 for lack of evidence.
 Arrest procedures are quite different in the rural emergency
 zones. The armed forces do not need a warrant to arrest
 
 
 592
 PERU
 persons, and persons detained by the military are held
 incommunicado. They do not have access to an attorney, nor
 are they permitted any contact with family members. They are
 interrogated without the presence of a public prosecutor or a
 defense attorney. Credible allegations of torture are common.
 The Constitution recognizes the concept of judicial
 determination of the legality of detentions, however, this
 Light is unlawfully disregarded in the rural emergency zones
 under military control;.military base commanders simply ignore
 such requests.
 During 1986 and 1987, human rights groups noted that an
 increasing number of persons detained by the military in the
 rural emergency zones reappeared after a period of
 incommunicado detention. This may reflect pressure by the
 Government to reduce long-term detentions and summary
 executions. The number of arbitrary arrests and detentions in
 the emergency zones for 1987 is estimated to be in the
 hundreds.
 The Constitution prohibits compulsory labor and exile, and
 these provisions are respected in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is an independent branch of government. Supreme
 Court judges are nominated by the President and ratified by
 the Senate. 'The Supreme Court designates members of the lower
 courts. The legal system is based on the Napoleonic Code.
 Once criminal charges are filed, a judge determines whether
 probable cause exists. The next step is a judicial hearing
 process that may last up to 5 months, followed by a public
 trial. Defendants have the right to be present at the trial.
 Sentence may be appealed, and judges may send cases back to
 lower courts for additional investigation. Public defenders
 exist but in inadequate numbers. Many judges on the Superior
 and Supreme Court are active in political parties, and claims
 of politically motivated judicial decisions sometimes occur.
 One example, in October, was the removal from office by the
 Supreme Court, reportedly under pressure from the executive
 branch, of a lower court judge who had issued several
 ,decisions against application of the Government's bank
 expropriation law.
 Corruption and intimidation of witnesses and judges seriously
 impair the functioning of the judicial system. Luis Bertello
 Masperi, who had been extradited 5 months previously on charges
 of fraud in the bankruptcy of a bank, was released on bail,
 after the prosecutor failed to oppose the release orders. The
 Public Ministry ordered an investigation into the prosecutor's
 conduct, and the media speculated the judge would be replaced
 for lack of impartiality. The Supreme Court president charged
 the executive with interference in the judicial process.
 The courts face severe backlogs, a product of the sharp
 increase in terrorism cases, inefficiency, and influence
 peddling. The Government acknowledges that the majority of
 prisoners have not been sentenced and remain at some stage of
 the trial process. Human rights groups have documented
 numerous cases of persons who have been detained without bail,
 awaiting trial, for periods up to 4 years. Human rights
 groups and the Marxist opposition parties claim there are
 about 100 political prisoners, down from approximately 300 in
 1985. Most are members of leftist-parties who allegedly were
 unjustly accused of terrorism and who have been detained for
 
 
 593
 PERU
 several years awaitihg trial. The Government has resisted
 proposals to grant amnesty to such persons, whom it denies are
 correctly classified as political prisoners, instead calling
 upon the judiciary to speed up its handling of terrorism cases.
 Terrorists reportedly have threatened judges handling terrorism
 -cases. Many observers complain that known terrorists
 frequently are released by the courts oily to be arrested
 again. Judges blame this on a lack of evidence and poor case
 preparation by the police and prosecutors. Many government
 officials-blame it on terrorist intimidation of the judiciary.
 To remedy this, in 1987 Cbngress created a special tribunal
 for terrorism cases, with greater security measures to protect.
 judges-and witnesses; the tribunal began receiving cases in
 October. The initial judicial proceedings are still carried
 out by a regular penal "juez instructor"; the next stage (for
 cases in Lima) is the llth Superior Penal Court, designated to
 hear terrorism cases. So far, no verdicts have been reached,
 and the court reportedly has a severe backlog. One human
 rights group estimates it can handle fewer than 100 cases per
 year .
 The Constitution mandates that civilians be tried in civilian
 courbs.  -The Supreme Court dedides whether military and police
 offenders are-tried in civilian courts or in a separate
 military court system; the military attempts to assert its
 jurisdiction in these cases, and the court generally rules in
 its favor. The last attempt to have a civilian court try a
 militaryi-officer-was thwarted in'l986 when'the officer fled to
 avoid-'trial.' The civilian courts are making slow progress on
 several cases involving alleged police violations of human
 rights. These-include the 1984 death of peasant leader Jesus
 Oropezac(in Dedember, 8 policemen Uere sentenced for the
 killing), the March ,1982-killifigs of prisoners in an Ayacucho
 hospital;'.the November 1983 death of Francisco Nufflo, and the
 1986 torture of 11 detaihees in a Cuzco police station.'
 During 1987 the Supreme Court upheld maximum sentences against
 sevqralpolice officers fbr- killing :32 peasants in Soccos in
 1983.
 Military trialS are not public, -and little is known about
 specific trials. No member of the armed forces has ever been
 convicted in either the military or the civilian courts for
 human rights violations. Cases repoitedly pending in military
 courts include that of Lt. Telmo Hurtado for the murder in
 1985 of 69 persons in Accomarca, officer Edwin Diaz for 3
 deaths in Huanuco in 1985, 2 cases involving mass graves
 discovered in Pucayacu in 1984 and 1985, the case of Army
 General Jorge Rabanal and several police personnel in
 conjunction with'the:sumfnary ekecutioh of ipproximateiy 100
 pritsoneTs in 1986 at Lurigancho prison, and military personnel
 accused of the 1986 executions in Parcco and Pomatambo. In
 1987 relatives of killed and disappeared prisoners-at El
 Fronton prison filed suit against Navy and police personnel
 for the 1986 deaths of some 130 prisoners there.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution stipulates that police need a judicial
 warrant to enter a private dwelling, and this is generally
 respected in practice. The requirement for a warrant is
 suspended in those areas under a state of emergency, however,
 and security forces in those areas routinely conduct searches
 of private homes without a warrant.
 
 
 594
 PERU
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and the press.
 With 7 television networks, 57 radio stations, 16 daily
 newspapers, and many magazines in Lima alone, Peruvians have
 access to news and opinion of every political stripe, terrorist
 groups included. The media are highly partisan. The
 Government owns one of the two national television networks, a
 national radio network, and two newspapers. The government
 party itself also controls another 10 media outlets in Lima.
 Most major opposition parties control their own newspaper, and
 opposition figures frequently have access to the government
 media as well.
 The media expressed growing concern in 1987 about government
 attempts to influence unduly or to control media coverage.
 They made credible claims that government officials used
 newsprint supplies, state bank loans, and access to the
 national telecommunications network to affect media coverage.
 The government has denied any wrongdoing. In November, the
 government closed three radio stations in Tarapoto for
 noncompliance with license provisions. The stations claimed
 the action was a reprisal for having broadcast information
 about local guerrilla activity. One station reopened in
 January 1988.
 The media also complain that the government occasionally
 arbitrarily bars journalists from news events and confiscates
 video and photographic material of incidents which the
 Government does not want to have publicized. A serious
 problem in 1987 was the virtual barring by the military of
 most journalists from travel in the countryside of the
 Ayacucho emergency zone, apparently in response to a 1986
 media expose of human rights violations there.
 More disturbing are reports of government or government party
 violence against journalists and others. In addition to
 credible accounts of the APRA attempted bombing against the
 proterrorist daily El Diario, there were bombing attacks in
 September against the homes of two journalists fiercely
 critical of the Government. The Government has denied
 responsibility but has not been able to identify the
 perpetrators.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These rights are expressly provided for in the Constitution
 and are normally respected in practice in areas not subject to
 the state of emergency. Municipal authorities usually approve
 permits for demonstrations. The mayor of Lima however, denied
 permission for marches to commemorate the first anniversary of
 the prison riots. Unauthorized demonstrations occur and, for
 the most part, the Government deals with them in a
 nonconfrontational manner. However, in November riot police
 were filmed beating unarmed men and women assembled at the
 Plaza de Armas to demand that President Garcia fulfill a
 promise he had made several months earlier to xecognize the
 acreage given them by the Government. The right to assembly
 is suspended in areas under a state of emergency. In August,
 there were credible reports that APRA members threw bombs to
 disrupt an opposition meeting in Arequipa.

 those areas under a state of emergency. Peru is a party to
 the 1967'United Nations'Protocol on the Status of Refugees.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Peru is a democracy governed by a freely elected President and
 Congress. The political process is completely open and is
 vigorously contested by groups ranging from conservative to
 Marxist. However, Sendero Luminoso persistently seeks to deny
 citizens their political rights. Particularly in remote
 mountain areas, it kills candidates and elected officials and
 threatens voters.
 Suffrage is universal for persons over 18 years of age, except
 for members of the military. In April 1985, Peru held open
 and free elections for a President, two Vice Presidents, and
 240 Congressmen-and Senators.
 The July 1985 inauguration of President Garcia marked the
 first transfer of power between democratically elected
 governments in 40 years and the first accession to power of
 the APRA. The current administration has a majority in the
 Congress. Nationwide municipal elections took place in
 November 1986, contested by three major parties and more than
 a half-dozen smaller ones. Although most of the contests
 occurred without incident, several important races were close
 and led opposition groups to claim the Government had
 committed fraud or improprieties. In January 1987, the
 independent national elections board decided no fraud had
 occurred.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental'Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government welcomed visits in 1986 by AI, Americas Watch,
 and the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) Working
 Group on Forced or Involuntary Disappearances. None of the
 above groups sent delegations to Peru in 1987. Between 1984
 and 1987, the ICRC had access to prisons and police facilities.
 The military withdrew the ICRC's freedom to visit prisoners
 and detainees in the Ayacucho emergency zone, however; and in
 May the police cancelled the ICRC's access to the Dircote
 Detention Center. Local human rights groups-have criticized
 these developments; the government has not responded.
 The February 1987 AI special report on the 1986 prison
 killings was highly critical of the Government (see Section
 l.a.). The Government limited its response to claims that
 portions of the Al report, which it never identified, were
 false. The Government has not addressed specific criticisms
 voiced in regular AI or Americas Watch reports. Some
 government officials have criticized foreign and domestic
 human rights groups for not paying enough attention to
 terrorist violations of human rights.
 Several private human rights organizations comprise the
 independent National Coordinator for Human Rights. These
 include the Association for Human Rights, the Catholic
 Church's Episcopal Commission for Social Action, the National
 Human Rights Commission, and the Institute for Legal Defense.
 Smaller groups work in the departmental capitals and in other
 cities. These groups are credible observers, but they
 concentrate on government actions to the exclusion of
 terrorist human rights abuses. Lima is also the headquarters
 of the Andean Commission of Juristp which sponsors human
 rights analyses in Peru and other countries of the Andean

 region. Local human rights groups have not been harassed or
 threatened by the.Government, but the groups complain that
 their requests to the Government for information are often
 ignored..-
 Sectig,. -5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 -.Langgage, or Social Status
 The Constitution grants women equality with men, and laws on
 marriage and.divorce donot discriminate against women.
 Nevertheless, tradition impedes the access of women to,
 leadership roles in major.social and pol.iticpl institutions.
 There are 3 women in the 60-member Senate and 10 in the
 180-member Chamber.of Deputies.- Thereare two women in the
 Cabinet. WoMen.represent 26.percent-of the labor force. In
 1984,.61.,9 percent of. the  femalq workforce was employed in
 commerce and services, 16.6 percent in the industrial sector,
 and the remaining 19.5 percent in other occupations, mainly as
 domestics. The average wage of mate workers is double that of
 females.
 The rural, and indigenous population and Peru's small Black
 commupybi.ce situations similar-to thope-of women. -The
 former group traditionally has lacked access to public.
 services. Composed of several distinct geographic regions,
 Peru is a classic case of differential development: public
 investment traditionally has been focused on the coast,
 drawing migrants to thepcities, especially-Lima-., One-third of
 the population is in the'capital area an  accounts for
 two-thirds of the gross domestic product. Th. Government has
 increased the flow of resources and services to poor, largely
 Indian rural areas. Development efforts, however, have been
 affected by the difficulty and cost of providing services to
 areas out of.the mainstrgam of.Rispanic culture ,nd economic
 activity. As a result of this dicqotomy and n  historical
 prejudices, the economic and social needs of Peruvians of
 European angestry arp.-mgrelikqly ,to be iet than those-,of
