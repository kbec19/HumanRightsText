 PARAGUAY
 Paraguay has traditionally been governed by autocratic
 regimes, and has a history of wars, insurrections
 and coups. The country has been ruled under the state
 of siege provisions of the constitution almost continuously
 since 1929. President Alfredo Stroessner, an army
 general, has governed Paraguay since 1954 under these
 provisions, and there has been no effective challenge
 to his authority.
 Major violations of the integrity of the individual
 have decreased over the past three years. However,
 credible reports of harsh treatment and punishment
 were recorded in 1981, and the political and civil
 rights giarantees in Paraguay's constitution continue
 to be violated. The press continues to operate with
 considerable freedom. Opposition political elements
 are not able to participate fully and freely in the
 political process, and affiliation with the Colorado
 Party is often a prerequisite for significant participation
 in the nation's rapidly expanding economic activity.
 The judiciary, while formally independent, does not
 serve as an effective check on actions of the executive
 branch.
 There has been rapid economic growth over the last
 two decades. While poorer elements of the population
 have benefited in absolute terms from this economic
 growth, income disparities between the wealthy and
 the poor appear to have increased. The government
 continues its land distribution program, which has
 benefited over one-sixth of the nation's small farmers.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The constitution guarantees the protection of the
 physical integrity of the individual. However, there
 are still occasional allegations of the use of torture
 by the authorities to obtain information. The most
 credible case in 1981 involved an Argentine journalist
 who was arrested in February in connection with the
 investigation into the assassination of the ex-president
 of Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Paraguayan police are reliably reported to mistreat
 prisoners during early stages of detention, but prominent
 political detainees seem less subject to such mistreatment.
 Former detainees have stated that they were subjected
 to beatings, forced standing for long periods of time,
 denial of food, lengthy isolation, verbal abuse and
 threats against prisoners and their families. Conditions
 in police stations where detainees are first held
 are poor. In most cases, once formal charges are
 
 (504)
 
 
 505
 presented to the courts, detainees are transferred
 fairly quickly to regular prison facilities where
 conditions are generally better.
 There were no reports in 1981 of cruel, inhuman or
 degrading treatment or punishment during detention
 in regular prison facilities. While representatives
 of the International Red Cross are normally allowed
 access to detainees, in one case they were denied
 permission to visit two prisoners who were on a hunger
 strike. No known disciplinary actions have been taken
 against officials accused of torture, cruel, inhuman
 or degrading treatment or punishment of prisoners.
 The Paraguayan government's treatment of unassimilated
 Indians attracted international criticism as a result
 of the relocation in January of some 700 members of
 the Toba-Maskoy tribe. These Indians were forcibly
 removed from land granted earlier to them by a presiden-
 tial decree and placed in an area which appeared to
 offer limited potential for development. However,
 the government has provided food relief, dug some
 wells and promised to supply the necessary infrastructure
 for the Indians. In June 1981 *Survival International
 USA" lodged a formal complaint with the United Nations
 Commission on Human Rights. The complaint echoed
 charges made by the Paraguayan Bishops' Conference
 regarding the relocation of the Toba-Maskoy. Their
 plight was exacerbated by a seven-month drought in the
 Chaco region, which precluded the possibility of planting
 crops. Recent reports indicate that probably half of
 the original Indian settlement has fled from the site
 designated by the government to an area colonized
 by Mennonites.
 c. Disappearances
 During 1981 no case of disappearance is known to have
 occurred.
 d.. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Article 79 of the constitution has permitted the
 government to impose a state of siege upon the nation
 almost without interruption since 1929. The state
 of siege effectively suspends habeas corpus and the
 right of legal counsel and permits the government
 to detain suspects arbitrarily for indefinite periods
 of time. In May 1978 the state of siege was lifted
 nationwide, except for the capital. However, the
 courts have ruled that prisoners can be moved to Asuncion
 and held there, and police authorities often act as
 though the state of siege were still in force throughout
 Paraguay.   Article 79 is supplemented by law 209,
 the elastic, *anti-subversive" statute. Defendants
 prosecuted under this law have the rights of habeas
 corpus and legal counsel.
 As in years past, article 79 and law 209 accounted
 for the bulk of arbitrary detentions in Paraguay in
 1981. There was a marked increase in the number of
 persons detained arbitrarily for political reasons;
 the great majority of these detentions lasted from
 24 to 72 hours. Under article 79, the government
 also conducted warrantless house-to-house searches
 for "subversive elements" and prevented some meetings
 of the officially unrecognized political opposition.
 Such meetings require police permits under the state
 of siege.
 
 
 506
 With the end of year release of one detainee there
 were four prisoners with plausible claims to political
 prisoner status in custody as of December 31, 1981,
 including three members of the proscribed Communist
 Party. Apart from these, another prisoner was detained
 for apparently political reasons but has been charged
 with participation in three homicides which occurred
 20 years ago. Five others, four of whom were arrested
 in 1980 and one in 1981 are still being detained without
 formal charges in connection with the Somoza assassination
 investigation. Non-governmental human rights observers
 estimate the total number of political prisoners and
 those being detained arbitrarily at around 30, but
 that figure includes cases in which, while political
 factors may be involved, civil or criminal law may
 have been violated.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Paraguay has a well-developed body of laws and penal
 codes. While legal proceedings are reported in the
 press, and are formally in accord with the constitution,
 the judiciary is subject to executive and military
 influence, and there have been charges of extensive
 judicial corruption.   In cases involving political
 figures, fair trials are generally not possible.
 In September 1981 a lawyer representing an arbitrarily
 detained prisoner was sentenced to five days in jail
 for showing *disrespect toward the judiciary" by issuing
 a statement to the press which questioned both the
 validity of the charges against his client and the
 fairness of the court.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Under the law, judicial warrants are necessary before
 the security forces can enter private homes. However,
 using the state of siege provisions of the constitution,
 the police have conducted searches, detained persons
 and impounded or expropriated personal property, all
 without judicial writ. Such actions were widespread
 in the aftermath of the Somoza assassination in 1980,
 and have continued intermittently in 1981.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The media exercise self-censorship, and the government
 sometimes issues "press guidance" to the directors
 and senior editorial staffs of newspapers. Four journalists
 who were detained without charges during the Somoza
 assassination investigation were released in early
 1981. On December 30 the government closed a new,
 irregularly appearing periodical, "La Republica."
 "El Pueblo," organ of the opposition Febrerista Revolutionary
 Party, was closed by the government in late 1980,
 and has not reopened. Despite government pressures,
 the press in Paraguay reports independent and opposition
 viewpoints, and criticism of government policies is
 generally tolerated, except for criticism of the president,
 the military and key civilian leaders. However, incorrect
 quotations by the press can cause severe official
 reaction, as in the November and December cases of
 two "Ultima Hora" journalists who were detained incommunicado,
 
 
 507
 one for seven days and the other for 22 days, for
 allegedly misquoting a school official on the condition
 of the local economy. Foreign press reports critical
 of Paraguayan politics and policies are sometimes
 published in local papers.
 Radio and television are controlled by the government
 or its supporters, and reporting is less open than
 in the press. Opposition parties are not allowed
 access to the electronic media to air their views.
 Freedom of assembly is circumscribed. Opposition
 political parties, whether recognized by the government
 or not, are frequently denied the right to hold public
 meetings. In May 1981 police in the interior cities
 of Coronel Oviedo and Concepcion detained a total
 of 20 leaders of the unrecognized Authentic Radical
 Liberal Party and held them without charges for periods
 ranging from two to five days. Security forces,
 particularly outside the capital, have allegedly intimi-
 dated opposition politicians in order to prevent even
 private meetings in homes. In Asuncion, some opposition
 leaders and gatherings have been subject to police
 harassment.
 There is no independent trade union movement in Paraguay.
 The Federation of Paraguayan Workers (CPT), which
 represents over 90 percent of organized labor, is
 the only legal national labor organization. It is
 controlled by the government and dominated by the
 Colorado Party. A few unions associated with opposition
 political parties belong to the CPT. The slate of
 officials elected at the CPT's 1981 convention enjoyed
 open government support. While individual unions
 have shown some bargaining power, strikes are not
 permitted, and collective bargaining efforts have
 been frustrated repeatedly by private firms, despite
 legal guarantees.
 The Paraguayan constitution guarantees religious freedom
 for existing religious groups, and a wide variety
 of denominations conduct their activities freely.
 Legislation prohibits the conferring of legal status
 on any "new* religious groups. The Jehovah's Witnesses,
 who lost their legal registration in 1979 and cannot
 use their meeting houses for religious purposes, continue
 to appeal that decision in the courts.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The constitution provides for freedom of travel and,
 within Paraguay, this freedom is usually honored.
 Most citizens may enter and leave the country freely.
 However, officials have often refused to issue travel
 documents to political opponents, former political
 prisoners or persons who criticize the government.
 Many political opponents of the government, particularly
 the members of a dissident faction of the Colorado
 Party, have been forced into exile over the years.
 Although some have been allowed to return, they can
 do so only by undertaking not to participate in the
 political life of the country. Paraguay has followed
 a policy of welcoming immigrants and providing asylum
 to foreign refugees. Europeans, Japanese, Brazilians
 and Koreans, as well as large numbers of members of
 fundamentalist religious sects, have settled in Paraguay.
 
 
 508
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Only members of the dominant Colorado Party in good
 standing can fully participate in the political process.
 Individuals are pressed to join the Colorado Party
 in order to gain access to economic and social advantages
 which are subject to government influence, such as
 admission to the national university, access to government
 employment and the right to bid on public contracts.
 The government often appears to identify legitimate
 dissent with subversion and seeks to justify harassment
 of critics or opponents on the basis of national security.
 General elections are held every five years, and the
 law requires all Paraguayans 18 years of age and over
 to vote. A new electoral statute, which was signed
 into law on December 11, 1981, could affect participation
 by opposition parties. Some political groups are
 not recognized and are therefore not allowed to participate
 at all, while one recognized party voluntarily abstains
 from the process. Two other opposition parties are
 recognized, do participate in elections, and have
 representation in congress. Both recognized and unrecognized
 opposition parties are subject to harassment. In
 June 1981 the president of the unrecognized Christian
 Democratic Party was detained incommunicado for three
 days and then expelled from the country for 'affronts
 to the nation's leadership". The Communist Party
 is legally proscribed.
 Equal rights for women are 'guaranteed by the Paraguayan
 constitution. The traditional social system limits
 the participation of women, especially those from
 lower income groups. Women have traditionally played
 an inferior role in Paraguayan political life, and
 the executive and judiciary have few prominent women
 officials. There are three women in the 90-member
 congress, and several others are politically prominent.
 An increasing number of women are participating effectively
 in various professions, business and the artistic
 life of the country. Women normally receive less
 remuneration than men for comparable work.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigat!-Qn
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Paraguayan government responds to inquiries from
 international human rights bodies, including the United
 Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) and the Inter-
 American Human Rights Commission (IAHRC). At its
 February 1981 session in Geneva the UNHRC dropped
 Paraguay from those countries being considered under
 its confidential 1503 procedures. However, the UNHRC
 is currently considering private communications concerning
 human rights in Paraguay. Despite repeated commitments
 in past years, the government hah yet to schedule
 an on-site inspection of Paraguay by the IAHRC. While
 the government has allowed some visits by non-governmental
 human rights organizations over the years, foreign
 visitors who are perceived to be human rights activists
 may be denied entry. In August 1981 a plane carrying
 the Argentine winner of the 1980 Nobel Peace Prize,
 Adolfo Perez Esquivel, was denied permission to land
 in Asuncion. There were no visits by international
 
 
 509
 groups concerned with human rights during 1981.
 The Paraguayan Human Rights Commission and the Inter-
 Faith Committee, composed of three church groups,
 are both active in human rights in Paraguay, and their
 efforts are reported in the local press. Both organiza-
 tions have been subject to government criticism and
 harassment.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 During the past decade Paraguay has enjoyed the second
 highest rate of economic growth in the hemisphere,
 stimulated by construction activities associated with
 large hydroelectric projects on the Parana River,
 an expanding agricultural frontier and increasing
 trade. Real gross domestic product has almost doubled
 over the past five years. These factors, combined
 with the country's stable government, conservative
 fiscal and monetary policies and a laissez-faire approach
 to trade and investment have had a favorable economic
 impact on a broad segment of Paraguayan society.
 While most of the population has benefitted from the
 rapid growth of the economy, there is growing concern
 about the equitable distribution of income and wealth.
 .While the government continues to express support
 for developing a private industrial sector, the lack
 of one has contributed to a rapid expansion of state-
 owned enterprises. These are controlled by members
 of the Colorado Patty, and employment even at the
 lowest levels often depends upon party membership
 or official connections. Also, contracts for and
 employment in government-related projects, loans in
 the agricultural sector and the ability to participate
 in the flourishing unregistered trade are largely
 dependent upon party membership and official approval.
 Close economic relationships between insiders and
 government officials have led to widespread allegations
 of favoritism and irregular practices.
 The government also takes a laissez-faire approach
 to many social questions, relying on economic growth
 and private organizations to fulfill social needs
 whenever possible. As a consequence, government
 expenditures in these areas, particularly in health
 and education, are at relatively low levels, despite
 a modest upward trend in recent years.
 Central government per capita expenditure on health
 was $2.00 in 1978, the same as in 1972. Nevertheless,
 health and nutrition have improved as a consequence
 of economic growth. Life expectancy at birth was
 64 years in 1978, compared to 56 years in 1960. While
 no figures are available on the infant mortality rate,
 .the child death rate from ages one to four was seven
 per 1,000, down from 16 per 1,000 in 1960. This decline
 in child mortality and improved health conditions
 have led to an average annual population growth of
 2.9 percent from 1970 to 1979, up from 2.6 percent
 during 1960-1970. The percentage of the population
 with access to potable water was only 13 percent in
 1975, but the availability of safe water has increased
 in recent years. Malnutrition is widespread in rural
 areas due to gastrointestinal diseases associated
 with:inadequate availability of potable water.
 .Central government per capita expenditure on education
 
 
 510
 was $11.00 in 1978, an increase from $8.00 in 1973.
 The number of students enrolled in primary school
 as a percentage of age group in 1979 was 85 percent
 of the age group, or 87 percent for males and 84 percent
 for females. The adult literacy rate was 84 percent
 as of 1976, compared to 75 percent in 1960. Nevertheless,
 the functional literacy rate is probably lower. Teachers'
 pay in public primary schools is extremely low, about
 one-half of the minimum wage in the private sector.
 Most families with adequate means prefer to send their
 children to private schools. The number of students
 enrolled in secondary school was 25 percent in 1978,
 compared to 11 percent in 1960, reflecting a significant
 increase in the availability of secondary education.
 Similarly, the proportion of students enrolled in
 higher education was eight percent, compared to two
 percent in 1960. With increases in enrollment, the
 Colorado-controlled National University and the independent
 Catholic University remain poorly equipped, but are
 attempting to improve their facilities. There are
 no other universities in Paraguay at present.
 As a result of rapid economic growth, there have been
 absolute increases in income for almost all segments
 of the Paraguayan population. GNP per capita was
 $1,070 in 1979. wages have generally kept up with
 inflation, and at year's end unemployment was low,
 despite an economic slowdown during the latter part
 of the year. Electricity generation, telephone service,
 water supply and most government services have kept
 pace with population growth. Consumption of consumer
 goods has increased, reflecting an increase in the
 amount of disposable income, and there has been a
 considerable increase in the size of the middle class.
 Construction has flourished throughout the country,
 and the average number of persons housed per room
 has probably declined from the latest available figure
 of 2.4 for 1970. However, some reports indicate a
 growing deficit in low-cost urban housing.
 While there are no conclusive statistics available,
 income disparities between the rich and the poor appear
 to have increased. In urban areas there is an increasing
 amount of conspicuous consumption, while 19 percent
 of the urban population remains below the poverty
 level. In rural areas the comparable figure is 50
 percent. However, there is very little abject poverty
 or misery. The government has attempted to ameliorate
 rural poverty with a colonization program which has
 offered principally new lands to over one-sixth of
 the nation's small farmers thus far.
