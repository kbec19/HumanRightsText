HAITI
Worsening human rights conditions, mounting political turmoil, and a
declining economy marked President Jean-Bertrand’s Aristide first year
back in office. The investigation into the murder of crusading journalist Jean
Dominique reached a standstill, with the judge assigned to the case receiving little
cooperation from the police and other government bodies. The work of human
rights defenders became increasingly dangerous, as several received serious death
threats.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Aristide won the presidency in November 2000, in an election that was boycotted
by credible opposition candidates because of the government’s failure to
remedy the deeply flawed results of the May 2000 legislative and local elections.The
Organization of American States (OAS) and other international observers refused
to monitor the November balloting, in which Aristide faced no serious challengers.
During meetings with U.S. Special Envoy Tony Lake in December 2000,Aristide
committed to undertaking a series of steps to address the country’s serious problems.
The reforms he promised—which included remedying the results of the May
2000 elections,professionalizing the police and judiciary, and strengthening democratic
institutions—were urgently needed. Unfortunately, over the course of the
year,Aristide showed little inclination to follow through on his promises.
Despite many millions in international aid hanging in the balance, progress
toward resolving Haiti’s political crisis was painfully slow.As of late November, no
agreement had yet been reached between Fanmi Lavalas, the party of President
Aristide, and the Democratic Convergence, the main opposition coalition. Talks in
October brokered by OAS envoy Luigi Einaudi, the latest in a long series of negotiations,
broke down almost immediately. Although the two sides had tentatively
agreed to hold new legislative elections in November 2002, they were unable to
resolve other areas of disagreement.
The country’s polarization raised the spectre of political violence. In early January,
a month before Aristide’s inauguration, leaders of so-called popular organizations
that supported Fanmi Lavalas made violent threats against a number of
opposition figures. Speaking at a press conference at the church of Saint Jean Bosco,
Aristide’s former parish, Paul Raymond and René Civil referred to a list of opposition
leaders, religious figures, journalists, and others who they said were opposed
to Aristide’s inauguration. They warned the people on the list to change their position
within three days or face violent retaliation.
With Aristide’s inauguration and the opposition’s declaration of a “parallel government,”
political instability continued. There were several outbreaks of violent
unrest over the course of the year. In mid-March, angry mobs staged street demonstrations and erected burning barricades in parts of Port-au-Prince to protest
opposition claims that the government lacked legitimacy. The office of the main
opposition coalition was firebombed, as pro-government demonstrators called for
the arrest of the opposition’s self-styled “president,” Gerard Gourgue.
At the end of the March wave of violence,which spread to other Haitian cities as
well, at least four people had been killed and many more injured. Police inaction in
the face of violent demonstrations by armed gangs raised doubts about the government’s
interest in quelling the unrest.
A chain of attacks on police stations on July 28, characterized by the government
as a coup attempt, led to a crackdown on the opposition.Although the motives and
circumstances of the attacks were unclear, it was undisputed that armed men clad
in the uniform of Haiti’s disbanded army seized the national police academy for
several hours and later tried to take over several police stations in central Haiti.
Seven people were killed, including five police. At least forty people were arrested
in the wake of the attacks, including many members of the Democratic Convergence.
A number of the arrests were made without a judicial warrant, leading a
coalition of local human rights groups to complain that the arrestees’ prolonged
detention was “arbitrary and illegal.”
Earlier in the year, several hundred former army officers had held demonstrations
to demand the restoration of the army,which was dissolved by President Aristide
in 1995. Many believed that the July attacks were carried out by such former
officers.
In mid-November, large scale rioting broke out in Cap Haitien, Haiti’s second
largest city, following a call by the main opposition coalition for a two-day general
strike to pressure President Aristide and his political allies to relinquish power. The
previous week, smaller demonstrations were held in Petit-Goave and Gonaives,
coastal towns west of the capital.
Although in the first half of the year there were encouraging signs of progress in
the investigation into the April 2000 killings of journalist Jean Dominique and
security guard Jean Claude Louissant, by November the case appeared stalled.
Investigating Judge Claudy Gassant, citing safety concerns, announced that he
would not accept the renewal of his appointment to the case, set to expire in January
2002. Earlier, in June, Judge Gassant had resigned from the case because of security
threats and a lack of government protection.He fled to the United States at that
time but returned after a few weeks, when the minister of justice promised to provide
armed bodyguards and other security guarantees. Gassant faced death threats
and intimidation because of his work.
Stymied by a lack of cooperation from police and other officials, Gassant was
unable even to question some of his top suspects. Arrest warrants issued against
Paul Raymond, René Civil, Richard Solomon, and Franck Joseph had no effect,
with the suspects moving freely about the capital.Another leading suspect, Senator
Dany Toussaint, benefited from parliamentary immunity. As of November, more
than three months after receiving Judge Gassant’s request that Toussaint’s immunity
be lifted, the Senate had yet to make any decision on the question. Indeed, the
parliamentary commission charged with examining the request did not even meet
until five weeks after the request was made.
In early November, one of Dominique’s suspected killers was lynched by an
angry mob in Léogane, a town southwest of the capital.He was the second suspect
in the case to die before being questioned. The killing, which police apparently
allowed to take place, further hindered the investigation of the case. Judge Gassant,
who witnessed the murder, announced two days later his decision to leave the case.
Ivorian journalist Abdoulaye Guedeouengue—who was abducted, beaten, and
robbed in May—had been investigating the Dominique murder at the time of his
capture.He was reportedly warned by the kidnappers to stop looking into the case.
As the Guedeouengue case indicated, the media came under increasing pressure
to limit its reporting. On October 12, Jean Robert Delciné, a journalist with Radio
Haiti Inter, was hit by police while investigating a police killing in Cite Soleil.Other
Radio Haiti Inter journalists also reported threats and harassment over the course
of the year, in some instances by men believed to be police. On October 2,members
of a so-called popular organization close to Fanmi Lavalas threatened radio journalist
Jean-Marie Mayard, telling him that he would be a “dead man” if his reporting
did not favor the Aristide government.According to Reporters without Borders,
a France-based international press freedom organization, ten journalists were
threatened or attacked by people connected to Fanmi Lavalas during the first ten
months of the year.
The justice system remained largely dysfunctional, with many crimes going
unpunished. In June, in a speech to police, President Aristide announced a “zero
tolerance”crime policy, stating that it was not necessary to bring criminals to court.
His words were widely interpreted by Haitians as an invitation to vigilante justice
and police violence. Human rights groups reported that in the months following
the speech, dozens of suspected thieves were killed by mobs.
The increasing politicization of the Haitian National Police (HNP) raised additional
concerns. The reluctance of police to intervene in certain situations to prevent
political violence, typically when opposition supporters were in danger, was
frequently in evidence. In an open letter to the police leadership sent in October, the
nongovernmental National Coalition for Haitian Rights (NCHR) deplored the
HNP’s lack of political neutrality. The letter drew attention to the failure of the
police to arrest certain criminal suspects pursuant to valid arrest orders and, in contrast,
the willingness of the police to arbitrarily arrest others. It also claimed that
several police officers, previously dismissed for involvement in serious human
rights violations, had been reintegrated into the force.
Accountability for past abuses remained elusive. Although the success of the
Raboteau trial in 2000 raised hopes of further such prosecutions, the prospect of
achieving justice for many other notorious crimes seemed remote. In a letter sent
on August 28, the seventh anniversary of the assassination of Father Jean Marie
Vincent, NCHR criticized what it called the “systematisation of impunity.”
Former Gen. Prosper Avril,who headed the country’s government for two years
after a 1988 coup, was arrested on May 28 on charges of assault, torture and illegal
arrest. Avril’s rule was characterized by egregious human rights abuses. Although
efforts to prosecute such crimes were all too rare in Haiti, the circumstances and
timing of Avril’s arrest suggested that it was politically motivated. The arrest was
made on the basis of a 1996 warrant that had been ignored for years; it was acted upon only after Avril attended a highly-publicized meeting of the main opposition
coalition. A number of political figures who were tortured under Avril’s government,
but had since joined the current opposition,were unwilling to testify against
Avril regarding past abuses. In June, a court of appeals judge ordered that Avril be
freed, but the head of the public prosecutor’s office refused to sign the release form,
blocking the defendant’s release.
Prison conditions remained dire, with the country’s desperately overcrowded
prisons and jails being largely filled with pretrial detainees. Detention facilities
lacked the necessary infrastructure and many failed to provide medical care, sufficient
food,or even potable water. A study of the prison system published by the Vera
Institute for Justice found “a serious problem of malnutrition.” In mid-November,
five prisoners were killed by police who were putting down a riot at the National
Penitentiary in Port-au-Prince.
Of all Latin American and Caribbean countries, Haiti continued to have the
highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS, although treatment was largely unavailable.
According to UNICEF, some 74,000 Haitian children were orphaned because of the
AIDS pandemic.Many of the orphans were themselves HIV-positive.
Determined to escape Haiti’s dire conditions, thousands of Haitians tried to
leave the country in overcrowded and rickety boats.Many of them, hoping to reach
the United States, were intercepted by U.S. coast guard cutters and immediately
repatriated, while an unknown number died at sea.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Human rights defenders came under increasing pressure in 2001, with several
receiving death threats. In October, both NCHR and the Platform for Haitian
Human Rights Organizations (POHDH) were threatened following the publication
of a strongly-worded letter from NCHR to the police leadership.
Pierre Espérance, the director of NCHR in Haiti, also received several menacing
calls in August. The different callers warned him that if NCHR continued to press
for justice in the Jean Dominique case, he would be eliminated. Espérance had reason
to take such threats seriously, having suffered an assassination attempt in 1999.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
At this writing, some U.S. $500 million in international aid remained frozen,
reflecting donor governments’ impatience with Haiti’s inability to resolve the political
crisis.
United Nations
In November 2000, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended against
renewing the mandate of the United Nations International Civilian Support Mission
in Haiti (MICAH). In an usually critical report to the General Assembly, he noted that over the previous several months, “Haiti’s political and electoral crisis
has deepened, polarising its political class and civil society.” In light of such conditions
he concluded that MICAH’s ability to function successfully was limited.
MICAH’s mandate ended on February 6, the day before President Aristide entered
office.
In July, Secretary-General Annan reiterated that the resolution of the political
crisis was a prerequisite for the resumption of aid to Haiti.
Adama Dieng, the United Nations independent expert on the human rights situation
in Haiti, issued his last report on conditions in Haiti in January. In it, he drew
attention to the deterioration of the system of justice, noting the “politicization of
the police, arbitrary arrests, prolonged detention without trial, the climate of violence
and also the deplorable health conditions in the prisons.”Dieng,who resigned
from his post to work for the Rwanda war crimes tribunal, had not been replaced
as of November.
The U.N. Commission on Human Rights, issuing a chairperson’s statement in
April, called upon the Haitian government to thoroughly investigate politically
motivated crimes, including the murder of journalist Jean Dominique; to prosecute
the perpetrators of such crimes; to institute legal proceedings against perpetrators
of human rights violations identified by the National Commission for Truth
and Justice; and to ensure the neutrality of the police.
Organization of American States (OAS)
As in 1999, Luigi Einaudi, assistant secretary-general of the Organization of
American States (OAS), carried out intensive efforts to break Haiti’s political deadlock.
He made a number of trips to Haiti, including in February, April,May, June,
and October. In May and June, Einaudi visited Haiti in the company of OAS Secretary
General Cesar Gaviria.Their efforts to mediate the crisis did not,however, bear
fruit.
In early October, the OAS established a new “Group of Friends on Haiti”—made
up of Canada, Argentina, the Bahamas, Belize, Chile, Guatemala, Mexico, the
Dominican Republic, United States, and Venezuela—in hopes of restarting the
stalled negotiations.
United States
In September, on the tenth anniversary of the military coup that drove him from
power, President Aristide announced that the United States had returned thousands
of pages of documents gathered from the offices of the Haitian military and
the paramilitary Revolutionary Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti
(FRAPH).The documents,which detailed paramilitary abuses after the 1991 coup,
had been seized by U.S. forces in September 1994. It was believed, however, that the
names of U.S. citizens had been excised from the returned documents, a condition
that previous Haitian administrations had publicly rejected.
The failure of the United States to extradite Emmanuel “Toto”Constant, former
FRAPH leader, continued to thwart Haitians’hopes for justice for past abuses.Constant, previously an informer for the Central Intelligence Agency, remained in
Queens, New York, having been extended protection from deportation. Other
members of the coup-era high command were also resident in the United States.
European Union
Finding that “respect for democratic principles has not yet been re-established
in Haiti,” in January the European Union (E.U.) terminated consultations with
Haiti that had been initiated under the Cotonou Agreement, an aid pact linking the
E.U. with African, Caribbean, and Pacific states. As a result, all direct budget aid to
Haiti was suspended.
