SIERRA LEONE
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Sierra Leone made significant progress in 2002. On January 18, President
Ahmad Tejan Kabbah declared that the decade-long civil war had ended, and on
March 1, he lifted the four-year state of emergency. On May 14 the people of Sierra
Leone went to the polls and re-elected President Kabbah and his Sierra Leone
People’s Party for a further five-year term. The elections were largely peaceful,
though there were a few reports of violence and intimidation. Eleven parties vied
for the presidency and 124 parliamentary seats. The seventeen thousand-strong
peacekeeping force of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL)
completed disarmament of over forty-seven thousand combatants, contributing,
with British-led efforts to rehabilitate the ill-disciplined police and army, to dramatic
improvement in prospects for peace, security, and respect for human rights.
By October more than 195,000 Sierra Leonean refugees from Guinea, Liberia, and
the broader sub-region had returned home. Two important transitional justice
mechanisms aimed at ensuring accountability for the horrific abuses that characterized
the war—the Special Court for Sierra Leone and the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission—also began operations. Against these positive developments,
the intensification of civil war in neighboring Liberia created a large refugee population
in Sierra Leone, resulted in instability in the border areas, and drew in hundreds
of Sierra Leonean former combatants to fight for both Liberian government
and rebel forces.
From May 2001 through January 2002, UNAMSIL disarmed and demobilized
close to forty-eight thousand combatants from the rebel Revolutionary United
Front (RUF) and Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC), and from the government-allied Civil Defense Force (CDF) militias. Of these, 6,845 had been child
combatants, 92 percent of them boys. The vast majority of former child soldiers
have been reunited with their families and about half of them were either enrolled
in educational support or skills training programs. The United Nations Children’s
Fund (UNICEF) identified at least four hundred girls who remained with their
former RUF captors, willingly or unwillingly. There were few reports of retaliation
against former RUF combatants as they returned to their villages and towns.However,
in former rebel strongholds returning refugees and internally displaced civilians
sometimes faced problems from former rebels including intimidation and
refusal to vacate returnees’ homes that they had occupied.
In addition, a December 2001 dispute over mining in the diamond-rich Kono
district led to serious clashes between former RUF rebels and youths from a local
organization called the Movement of Concerned Kono Youths (MOCKY).During
the clashes the youths, supported by policemen and former CDF militiamen, and
allegedly backed by local chiefs and leaders, attacked former RUF combatants and
their families. The clashes left at least thirteen mostly former RUF combatants
dead, the majority of them hacked to death with machetes. During the fighting
thousands of civilians, including hundreds of former RUF fighters, fled the area.
There were periodic reports of MOCKY members using intimidation to evict non
Konos from towns within Kono district in what appeared to be an attempt to consolidate
ethnic Kono control over the diamond-mining area.
After being held without charge for eighteen months, former RUF leader Foday
Sankoh and forty-nine other former RUF rebels on March 4 were taken to court
and charged with various criminal offenses including murder. The charges related
to an incident on May 8, 2000 when Sankoh’s bodyguards had opened fire on
demonstrators in Freetown, the capital, killing at least twenty. Separately charged
to court also in March were thirty-six members of the West Side Boys, a splinter
group of the AFRC, who had been captured in September 2000, during a British
assault on their base.
While there were very few complaints of abuses by the army, there were frequent
complaints of corrupt, unprofessional, and in some cases violent practices by the
Sierra Leone Police. Hundreds of ordinary criminal suspects continued to be
arrested without warrants and/or unlawfully detained, many without due process
guarantees as stipulated in the constitution. The insufficient number of judges,
magistrates, prosecutors, and courtrooms continued to lead to huge backlogs
within the legal system and the denial of justice for hundreds of detainees.The High
Court was only functional in Freetown and two other provincial towns; several
magistrates courts also remained closed, though three destroyed during the war, in
Kambia,Makeni and Magburaka, were refurbished and reopened.
On July 5 President Kabbah formally swore in the seven Truth and Reconciliation
Commission (TRC) commissioners, three international and four national.
The commission had one year to prepare a record of abuses in Sierra Leone during
the civil war from 1991 and make recommendations to avoid their repetition and
promote healing. Efforts to establish the TRC were spearheaded by the Office of the
United Nations (U.N.) High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), and was
a priority for both the UNAMSIL human rights section and local human rights groups. In August the originally proposed budget of U.S.$9.98 million was scaled
back to $6,276,440, of which, at this writing, barely a third had been pledged by
donors. Following a three-month preparatory period, hearings were scheduled to
begin in October 2002, but were pushed back until November following this poor
donor response.
On January 16, after over a year of negotiations, the U.N. and the government of
Sierra Leone signed an agreement that created the legal framework for the Special
Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL), an independent court using both international and
Sierra Leonean law, judges, and prosecutors. In March, the Sierra Leonean Parliament
passed an act implementing this agreement into law. The court will be based
in Freetown and will prosecute persons bearing “the greatest responsibility” for
serious violations of international humanitarian law and certain crimes under
national law perpetrated from November 30, 1996 onwards. On April 19, 2002,
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed a senior attorney of the United
States Department of Defense, David Crane, as the SCSL chief prosecutor, and
Robin Vincent (United Kingdom) as registrar. After great delay by the U.N. Secretariat
in obtaining the necessary approvals for funding the SCSL, it began operations
in July. The SCSL is to operate for at least three years and has a proposed
budget of U.S.$56.8 million. While funds for the court’s first year have been
secured, there are shortfalls for the second and third years. A management committee
representing the major donor states (United States, United Kingdom,
Netherlands, and Canada) plus Lesotho and Nigeria, has oversight over the functioning
of the court.UNAMSIL offered little administrative and logistical support
to the SCSL, despite official commitments to do so.
Among the impacts on Sierra Leone of the renewed war in Liberia, as of October
2002 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) had registered
more than 37,500 Liberian refugees in Sierra Leonean camps. Liberian
government troops and rebels of the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy
(LURD) often crossed into Sierra Leone to loot, buy provisions, escape
fighting, or abduct people who are then forced to work for them as porters. From
January to October there were at least fifteen such cross-border incursions, resulting
in at least two deaths and the abduction of scores of Sierra Leoneans.
Hundreds of former RUF,West Side Boys and CDF combatants in Sierra Leone
crossed over to fight as mercenaries with either the Liberian government or the
LURD. There were also credible reports of recruitment from within the Liberian
refugee camps in Sierra Leone. The presence of hundreds of Liberian government
and rebel deserters in Sierra Leone prompted the government of Sierra Leone to
move to set up an internment camp,which at this writing was under construction.
Another vulnerability of refugees was highlighted in February 2002, in a report
by UNHCR and Save the Children-U.K. which alleged that refugee children in
Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone had been subjected to sexual abuse and exploitation
by employees of national and international nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs), UNHCR and other U.N. agencies. The report provoked a major outcry,
including from Kofi Annan who said he was “clearly shocked and disturbed.” The
report found that the victims were mostly teenage girls, and that the perpetrators
were often “men in positions of relative power and influence who either control access to goods and services or who have wealth and/or income.” The government
of Sierra Leone, U.N. agencies and NGOs established a Coordination Committee
for Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (CCSEA) to address the problem. The U.N.
Office for Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) and the UNHCR inspector-general
conducted an in-depth follow-up investigation, and in Geneva, the U.N. and
humanitarian community formed the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC)
Task Force on Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse to look at issues of
protection and codes of conduct. However, the strategies adopted by the humanitarian
agencies generally lacked a discussion of the importance of holding perpetrators
accountable.
UNAMSIL was itself responsible for some similar and other abuses. In April witnesses
saw a woman apparently being raped by two Ukrainian peacekeepers near
the eastern town of Joru.There was no formal investigation into the matter. In June
a Bangladeshi officer was accused of sexually assaulting a fourteen-year-old boy living
in a transit camp for recently returned refugees. A formal UNAMSIL investigation
came up with inconclusive results and the peacekeeper was repatriated soon
after the investigation. On July 18 two people were killed and three injured after
Nigerian UNAMSIL peacekeepers moved to quell violence that had erupted in
Freetown after a Sierra Leonean black-market trader was allegedly murdered by
Nigerian criminals. Initial reports by an ad-hoc UNAMSIL task force set up to
investigate the incident found that the peacekeepers “employed a combination of
persuasion, crowd dispersal tactics and firing of warning shots into the air” to break
up the riot. They concluded that “the facts available to UNAMSIL indicate that at
no time was firing directed at the crowd.”By contrast, an August 22 report by a committee
of seven Sierra Leonean human rights groups found that the peacekeepers
fired into the crowd, killing the two, and characterized the peacekeepers’ conduct as
“disproportionate use of force.” The leadership of UNAMSIL was generally reluctant
to investigate allegations of abuses by peacekeepers.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Numerous human rights NGOs operated in Sierra Leone. Thirty-three of these
groups were part of a coalition called the National Forum for Human Rights
(NFHR) whose purpose was coordination, and technical advice to the membership.
The establishment of government control over previously inaccessible areas
of the country allowed human rights groups to start operating outside Freetown.
However, most of these lacked funding, expertise, and institutional support.
As in past years, these groups did little monitoring of human rights abuses.Most
of their activities focused on human rights and civic education for the public, promoting
reconciliation, and preparing for the TRC. Local groups did not generally
document and publicly denounce governmental non-compliance with due
process, and abuses by the police or army.
The formation of an autonomous, quasi-judicial national human rights commission,
as provided for in the 1999 Lomé Peace Agreement, received little national
or international attention and neither UNAMSIL nor the government actively advocated for its formation. Meanwhile, the existing governmental body, the
National Commission for Democracy and Human Rights (NCDHR), formed in
1996, continued to be severely constrained by lack of funds. As in past years, it did
little or no monitoring or documentation of human rights violations. Its activities
consisted of voter education; human rights education for the army, police and
members of Parliament; and preparation for the TRC. It did, however, continue to
run a successful legal aid clinic for indigents.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
International election observers, including the Carter Center, European Union,
Commonwealth Observer Group, Organization of African Unity, and Economic
Community ofWest African States, praised the manner in which the elections had
been held, although they noted irregularities including multiple voting, underage
voting, and direct interference with the marking of ballots. With the successful
completion of disarmament and the peaceful elections, international donors
turned their attention to post-conflict issues, including the reintegration of former
combatants, resettlement of refugees and the internally displaced, consolidation of
state authority, and the fight against corruption.While there was donor support for
the Special Court for Sierra Leone, at least for its first year of operations, there was
inadequate support for other accountability mechanisms including the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (to which, at this writing only U.S.$2.1 million—
$500,000 each from the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands,
$400,000 from Norway, and $200,000 from Sweden—had been pledged towards
the more than $6.2 million budget) and rehabilitation of the judicial system.
United Nations
The presence of 17,500 peacekeepers, currently the largest and most expensive
U.N. military mission in the world, contributed significantly to the successful completion
of both disarmament and elections. UNAMSIL’s budget for 2002 was an
estimated U.S.$717 million. In a June 19 report to the U.N. Security Council on
UNAMSIL,KofiAnnan said that existing governmental security apparatus was not
yet capable of protecting Sierra Leone from both internal and external threats and
warned that the international community must protect the major investments that
had made possible the progress achieved so far. On September 24, the Security
Council extended UNAMSIL’s mandate for a further six months, following a further
report on UNAMSIL which laid out benchmarks to govern the withdrawal of
the U.N. from Sierra Leone, including the ability of the police and army to maintain
security, the successful re-integration of ex-combatants, and the situation in
the broader sub-region. The resolution also encouraged UNAMSIL to promote
zero tolerance of sexual violence and exploitation and called on states to bring to
justice their own nationals responsible for such crimes in Sierra Leone.
The UNAMSIL human rights unit—mandated in 2001 to be twenty persons
strong—usually operated with at least seventeen monitors and operated four regional human rights offices, in Kenema, Port Loko, Makeni, and Koidu. The
monitors conducted investigations into ongoing and past abuses, including an in
depth project on victims of amputation and sexual violence, and set up a database
to map human rights abuses during the conflict. UNAMSIL supported a research
project on war-related sexual violence by Physicians for Human Rights, and in February
jointly launched the project’s comprehensive report. In June 2002, OHCHR
funded a month-long mission to Sierra Leone by a team of Argentinian forensic
experts who conducted preliminary investigations into numerous mass grave sites
and alleged “execution houses.”
In December 2001, the Security Council extended for an additional eleven
months the ban on imports of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone that did not have
a government certificate.
The Mine Ban Treaty entered into force for Sierra Leone on October 1. Sierra
Leone had not submitted its initial Article 7 Report, which was due on March 20.
Organization of African Unity/African Union
and Economic Community of West African States
Diplomatic activity by the OAU/African Union and Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) focused on resolving the crisis in Liberia, including
by addressing its regional aspects. However, there was reluctance to address the
presence of LURD rebels in Sierra Leone.
European Union
The E.U. Special Envoy for the Mano River region (i.e. Guinea, Liberia, and
Sierra Leone), Hans Dahlgren, had by October 2002 visited the region five times
following his appointment in 2001.
Ongoing European Commission development cooperation projects in Sierra
Leone totaled Û142 million (approximately U.S.$139 million), and were primarily
focused on social sector development. In late 2001, the European Commission gave
Û10 million ($9.85 million) to the Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration
(DDR) Multi-Donor Trust Fund to assist former combatants. In January 2002,
the European Commission granted Û17 million ($16.75 million) for humanitarian
assistance to refugees and internally displaced persons affected by crisis within the
Mano River Union.Out of this, Û11 million ($10.8 million) was granted to projects
in Sierra Leone.
The European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights chose Sierra Leone
as one of its “focus countries,” and made available Û2 million per year over three
years (2002-04) to be allocated to NGOs working on human rights and good governance.
At this writing, the E.U. itself had not decided on any joint E.U. contribution to
the Sierra Leone Special Court, though a number of member states contributed,
including Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
United Kingdom
The U.K. continued to play a pivotal role in political and military developments
in Sierra Leone. Priorities were the rehabilitation of the army and police, the fight
against corruption, and the provision of humanitarian relief. During a visit to
Sierra Leone in February, Prime Minister Tony Blair gave reassurance of the U.K.’s
long-term commitment to Sierra Leone. However, Secretary of State for International
Development Clair Short, visiting in February, warned that governmental
failure to address “endemic” corruption could jeopardize the U.K.’s willingness to
invest in and assist the country.
The U.K. continued its efforts to rebuild, restructure and equip the Sierra Leone
Army and the Sierra Leone Police. In May, the British-led International Military
Advisory and Training Team (IMATT) completed the training of over fourteen
thousand Sierra Leonean soldiers, some three thousand of whom were former
rebels or government militia members. In July, 220 British combat support troops
left Sierra Leone, albeit 114 mostly U.K. military personnel continued to play a
major role in advising and directing military operations, including the staffing of
key positions within the Sierra Leone defense headquarters. In coordination with
the Commonwealth Secretariat, the U.K. also provided officers and funds for training
and administration of the Sierra Leone Police, including the secondment of a
British officer as inspector general.
During 2002, U.K. assistance to Sierra Leone, mostly administered through the
Department for International Development (DFID), was estimated to be _38.3
million (U.S.$59 million). This included funding for the Anti-Corruption Commission,
rehabilitation of the legal system, reintegration programs for combatants,
training of the army and police, assistance to the National Electoral Commission
and to human rights and civil society groups, humanitarian aid, and helping to
restore the local Paramount Chiefs. The U.K. pledged e5.9 million ($9.1 million)
over three years to the Special Court, _322,000 ($500,000) to the TRC, and spent an
estimated _16 million ($24 million) on IMATT.
United States
U.S. policy on Sierra Leone revolved around supporting the consolidation of
civil authority, fighting corruption, combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, and providing
humanitarian support.The U.S. pledge of $15 million over three years to the
SCSL was the largest of any contributing nation. The U.S. total humanitarian and
emergency contribution in fiscal year 2002, including grants to aid agencies,World
Food Programme, assistance to refugees, programs to combat HIV/AIDS, reintegration
of combatants, and development programs was $56 million. In March, the
U.S. contributed $1.9 million to the DDR program. In September, the U.S. dispatched
an additional $6.6 million from the Emergency Refugee and Migration
Fund (ERMA) to respond to the refugee crisis brought on by the renewed war in
Liberia. The U.S. provided three military officers to work with the IMATT.
Of the seven West African battalions trained by the U.S. for peacekeeping with
UNAMSIL, five—four Nigerian and one Ghanaian—were in 2001-02 deployed to Sierra Leone. There was no mechanism set up to monitor the behavior and performance
of the soldiers.
