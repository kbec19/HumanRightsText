 SENEGAL
 The government of Senegal has compiled an impressive human
 rights record. Senegal is a multi-party state, and its open
 society encourages a free and open debate of the important
 issues of the moment. No reports have been received of any
 significant violations of human rights in Senegal in recent
 years. Such impartial arbiters as Amnesty International
 identified no critical deficiencies in Senegalese human
 rights practices.
 In 1980 Senegal played a leading role in establishing inter-
 national standards for human rights practices in Africa.
 At the 1979 Chiefs of State Summit Conference of the Orga-
 nization of African Unity (OAU), Senegal proposed an African
 Human Rights Commission. In the wake of this, the OAU charged
 Senegal with developing a draft charter, reviewed at the OAU
 ministers meeting in June 1980.
 Senegal maintained its commitment to human rights at home in
 1980. The opposition press grew in size and in quality. The
 courts continued to uphold the rights of individuals and priv-
 ate institutions against government claims. The National
 Assembly regularly criticized and evaluated government pro-
 grams. The major opposition party freely contested local
 elections in Senegal's fleuve region in late November.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Article 6 of the constitution states that the human person
 is sacred and must be protected by the state. The criminal
 code specifically prohibits physical abuse. Prohibitions
 against the use of torture are respected and enforced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Whipping of fractious prisoners is considered a legitimate
 punishment in Senegal. Prisons are far from ideal because of
 overcrowded conditions and meager fare. Chaplains, friends
 and family enjoy access to prisoners. Prisoners are segre-
 gated on the basis of sex. There is no discrimination.
 c. Disappearances
 There is no record of persons being abducted, secretly
 arrested or held in clandestine detention by official or
 quasi-official security forces or by elements whose acti-
 vities are condoned by the Senegalese government.
 d. Arbitraey Arrest and Imprisonment
 Arbitary arrest or imprisonment is forbidden by the constitu-
 tion and is not practiced. Article 6 of the constitution
 guarantees every citizen access to legal counsel in every
 aspect of legal procedure. Habeas corpus is not incorporated
 
 
 215
 into Senegalese law. Preventive detention is permitted
 when civil authorities determine that the threat of civil
 disturbance or a danger to the person exists.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are fair and open to the public. Civil cases are
 presented by a prosecutor and tried before a judge. Offi-
 cials of the courts are highly trained lawyers with several
 years of required apprenticeship. Appeal cases are tried
 by a court president and two counselors. Criminal cases
 have a similar panel of judges and at times are heard by a
 jury. Senegalese defense lawyers are famous throughout
 francophone Africa for their skills. The law profession is
 well organized and held in high regard.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 There are constitutional and legal safeguards against arbi-
 trary invasion of the home. According to article 12 the
 right of property is guaranteed. article 13 states that the
 home is inviolable. Search warrants may be issued only by
 judges and only according to appropriate procedures outlined
 by law.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 Senegal faces'severe economic difficulties in allocating its
 very limited resources, but government programs have increasingly
 favored the rural poor. The 1968-1973 drought, reinforced by
 that of 1977, brought Senegalese planners and officials to a
 realization that prospects for the significant growth of the
 Senegalese economy will depend fundamentally upon the broad
 development of the rural sector, including food production.
 The government has sought to break out of the limitations of
 a monocrop economy and to halt the excessive concentration of
 goods and services in Dakar, as well as to reverse the
 process of placing large sectors of the economy under the
 control of government corporations.
 Since 1974, and especially in the last three years, the gover-
 nment has taken several steps to remove the basic constraints
 to rural growth. In December 1979 Prime Minister Diouf
 bluntly attributed much of Senegal's disappointing economic
 performance to several government policies and articulated
 several important reforms: a limitation on the number, and
 of the salaries, of civil servants; strict budgetary control
 of parastatals; elimination of controls on farm gate prices;
 reduction of food and housing subsidies; and stimulation of
 exports. The government seeks to diversify agricultural
 production and decentralize the decision-making process by
 encouraging community councils to play a more assertive role.
 Financial austerity measures adopted in the wake of the Prime
 Minister's speech are designed to increase rural income and
 to reduce disparity in services offered urban and rural
 populations. Increased customs rates will affect mainly the
 elite. The liberalization of government monopoly of grain
 and peanut marketing the current budget, 25 percent of
 investment funds go to the agricultural sector, and 33
 percent are dedicated to social and community development.
 
 
 216
 Educational and cultural affairs account for over one-third
 of total budget expenses in this category.
 Women play an increasingly important role in this develop-
 ment effort. The State Secretariat for Human Resources,
 which is headed by Mme Maimouna Kane, has been given broad
 new powers in human resource development in the rural areas.
 The women's affairs section of the ministry is very active
 in insuring that the constitutional ban on sex discrimination
 is respected. A growing number of women participate in the
 institutions which shape the women's role in the Senegalese
 society. Women are seated as presidents to the courts, as
 counselors to the courts and as prosecuting attorneys.
 There are 15 women defense lawyers in the small Senegalese
 bar.
 Labor legislation in Senegal incorporates high rates of
 welfare benefits. In 1980 base wages were raised again
 about 25 percent.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech and intellectual inquiry are respected.
 There is no discrimination based upon race, ethnic origin
 or religion, and the Senegalese record for tolerance, both
 in law and actual practice, is excellent.
 Senegal has a vociferous and iconoclastic press, with a
 half-dozen regularly published newspapers ranging from
 politically conservative to Marxist-Leninist. Press activity
 tested the Senegalese government's patience in 1980, but the
 press freedoms were respected. After a lengthy public
 trial, one editor was condemned to 18 months in prison for
 multiple charges of disseminating false information.
 Charges against two other opposition journals were dismissed
 by the court. One opposition paper won a court case for
 defamation against the government-sponsored Youth Journal.
 Senegal's press legislation has in no way dampened the
 rhetoric of the opposition press.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Article 11 of the constitution states that all citizens
 of the republic have the right to move and establish them-
 selves freely anywhere in the republic. Travel in Senegal
 is not restricted. Exit visas are required for citizens
 wishing to travel overseas but attempts by the government
 to use this mechanism to restrict travel of political
 opponents has been turned back by the courts.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Senegalese constitution limits the number of political
 parties to four and defines the ideological orientation to
 which each party adheres. Effective political power is held
 by the Socialist Party. Three other recognized opposition
 parties are active and operate with 18 of the 100 seats in
 
 
 217
 
 the freely contested 1978 national elections. Unrecognized
 political groups regularly publish and openly sell political
 journals highly critical of the government.
 The development of a pluralist trade union movement has
 paralleled the country's development of multi-party democracy.
 Trade union elections have been free, with rank and file on
 occasion turning established labor leaders out of office.
 Locals occasionally initiate strike action against the
 advice of union centrals. Equal employment opportunity is
 legally assured for women, but lack of training or of
 previous employment experience as well as traditional views
 about the role of women in society hamper achievement in
 practice.
 4. Goverment Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The official press in Senegal has argued that the principle
 of nonintervention not be used to protect violators of human
 rights. Senegal has taken the lead in proposing an African
 charter for human rights which would set-up a supra-national
 commission for human rights surveillance in Africa. Senegal
 sponsored, as well, the first congress of the inter-African
 union of lawyers which set-up its own human rights institute
 and a commission charged with investigating human rights
 violations. Through the National Committee on Human Rights,
 the government supports popular education in human rights.
 No requests have been made by international or nongovernmental
 organizations to investigate alleged human rights violations
 in Senegal.
