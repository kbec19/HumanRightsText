BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
The return of displaced persons and refugees remained the principal unresolved
rights issue confronting the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.The major political
development was the formation of non-ethnic-nationalist governments at the
national level and in one of Bosnia’s two constitutive entities, the Federation of
Bosnia and Herzegovina. The ethnic nationalists continued, however, to exercise
effective power in majority Croat cantons in the federation. In the other entity,
Republika Srpska, Serbian nationalists remained a leading political force.
Bosnian nongovernmental organizations reported that the general elections
held on November 11, 2000,were the best-organized elections since the 1995 signing
of the Dayton/Paris Peace Agreement. An “open list” system was used in elections
for the federal House of Representatives, entity parliaments, and the cantonal
assemblies in the federation. The system enabled Bosniacs and Croats in the federation
to vote for candidates from the other ethnic group. The more numerous Bosniacs were thus able to influence the election of Croat candidates. Unsatisfied
with the electoral law, the main political party of Bosnian Croats—the Croat
Democratic Union (HDZ)—organized an ad hoc referendum on Croat self-rule on
the same day as general elections. The party also refused to cooperate with the
implementation of election results.
On February 22, Bosnia’s central parliament elected a cabinet (Council of Ministers)
composed solely of the members of a moderate seven-party grouping
dubbed the Alliance for Change. On March 12, the federation Parliament also
elected an Alliance for Change government. On March 3, HDZ and its nationalist
allies proclaimed self-governance in the territory inhabited by a Croat majority.
The efforts to establish self-rule suffered a decisive blow on April 18, when Stabilization
Force (SFOR) troops and OHR entered the main branch of the Hercegovacka
Bank in Mostar. International auditors blocked the HDZ’s access to funds in
the bank, thereby cutting off the sources of funding for the Croat self-governance
initiative. By mid-June, Croat soldiers who had left the joint federation army at
HDZ’s invitation renewed their contracts with the federation army.
As the security situation and political climate for return improved, the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) registered 56,683 returns of minorities
during the first nine months of 2001, an increase of almost 100 percent over the
same period in 2000.Most returns continued to be to in rural areas. The return of
minorities was still not self-sustaining, however, as returnees continued to face
scant employment opportunities and great obstacles to education for minority
children. The international community continued to fail to respond adequately to
the increased interest in return, with reconstruction funds falling far short of the
amount needed.Although rates of property repossession by returnees grew in comparison
to previous years, urban return remained modest.
While the security situation generally improved, serious incidents of ethnically
motivated violence continued to occur. In a dozen cases in Republika Srpska and,
less frequently, in the Croat parts of the federation, unknown perpetrators blew up
or set fire to reconstructed returnee houses, shot at returnees, or planted explosive
devices under their cars. On January 24, Zijada Zulkic, a forty-nine-year-old
Bosniac woman from Banja Luka, was found dead in her apartment with a bullet
wound. On May 7, some 4,000 Serbs beat and stoned three hundred elderly Bosniacs
who came to Banja Luka for a ceremony to mark the reconstruction of Ferhadija
mosque. At least eight people were taken to the Banja Luka hospital for medical
treatment. One of them, Murat Badic, aged sixty-one, died on May 26 of head
injuries. On July 12, a sixteen-year-old Bosniac returnee, Meliha Duric, was shot
dead by an unknown assailant in the village of Damdzici, near Vlasenica in Republika
Srpska. In November, Seid Mutapcic, a Bosniac returnee, was killed in Pale in
Republika Srpska.Again the motive and perpetrators were unknown, but the crime
was disturbing to the returnee community.
On April 6, an organized riot took place in west Mostar, Grude, Siroki Brijeg,
Medjugorje, and Tomislavgrad, during an abortive international audit of the
Hercegovacka Bank offices. A mob beat twenty-one members of SFOR and the
Office of the High Representative tasked with implementation of civilian aspects of
the peace process; two gunmen in Grude took eight investigators hostage and threatened to execute one of them. On May 5, Republika Srpska police in Trebinje
did little to prevent several hundred Serb nationalists from throwing rocks and bottles
at a delegation of state and international officials who came for a ceremony to
mark the reconstruction of a mosque.
Independent journalists received explicit threats from nationalists in both entities.
The Bosnian Helsinki Committee reported that journalist Ljuba Djikic from
Tomislavgrad was threatened with lynching after her son Ivica Djikic, also a journalist,
expressed his opinion about the situation in Croat-controlled parts of the
federation.Mika Damjanovic, a journalist of the Sarajevo daily “Dnevni Avaz” and
reporter-cameraman of the Federation TV, was attacked in Orasje by an HDZ
activist who accused Damjanovic of being a “Croatian traitor.”A bomb exploded in
the doorway of an apartment belonging to journalist Zoran Soviljs, causing only
property damage. The International Police Task Force concluded that his coverage
of trafficking and prostitution had motivated the attack. In April the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s Free Media Helpline registered an alarming
increase in complaints from radio and television stations in Croat-dominated
areas about pressure, threats, and intimidation of editors and staff made by the
HDZ and other Croat self-rule supporters.
SFOR apprehended two war crimes suspects, both indicted by the International
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in connection with crimes
committed in Srebrenica in July 1995:Col.Dragan Obrenovic was arrested on April
15, and Col.Vidoje Blagojevic on August 10.NATO officials repeatedly claimed that
NATO did not always know the whereabouts of indicted wartime Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic and former Serb army commander Ratko Mladic. In the
alternative, NATO officials suggested that the two were in the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and thus out of reach of NATO troops.
On August 4, the federation government surrendered to the tribunal three
Bosniac officers of the Bosnia and Herzegovina army, Enver Hadzihasanovic,
Mehmed Alagic, and Amir Kubura, charged with war crimes against Bosnian
Croats and Serbs during the 1992-1995 war. Bosnian Minister for Refugees Sefer
Halilovic surrendered to the tribunal voluntarily on September 25. The Republika
Srpska had still not apprehended and surrendered to the tribunal a single war crime
indictee. The Tribunal Office of the Prosecutor stated in October that at least seventeen
indictees were at large in Republika Srpska.Two indicted Bosnian Serbs, former
Republika Srpska president Biljana Plavsic and Serb Army officer Dragan
Jokic, voluntarily surrendered to the tribunal, on January 10 and August 15 respectively.
On October 2, the Republika Srpska National Assembly adopted a law on
cooperation with the tribunal.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Local and international human rights organizations were generally free to monitor
and report on the human rights situation. Due to concern for researchers’
safety, however, some organizations were unwilling to conduct research into corruption
in the country. The Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Helsinki Committee in Republika Srpska continued to be
among the leading human rights groups in the country. The office of the Ombudsman
for Republika Srpska became fully operative in November 2000. A similar
institution had already been in existence in the federation. Most decisions by the
national Human Rights Chamber,Bosnia’s human rights court,pertained to repossession
of houses and apartments by their pre-war owners.
Lara, an antitrafficking NGO in Bijeljina, continued to offer assistance to
women trafficked into Republika Srpska for forced prostitution and received
threats after launching a nationwide antitrafficking campaign.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
Office of the High Representative (OHR)
On June 21, the Peace Implementation Council Steering Board extended the
mandate of High Representative Wolfgang Petritsch for another year. Responding
to the March 3 proclamation of Croat self-governance in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
on March 7 Petritsch removed Bosnian Croat leader Ante Jelavic from his seat in the
national Presidency and barred him from holding any official or elected public
office or post within political parties. Between March and June, the high representative
also dismissed three leading HDZ politicians and four top-ranking police
officials in Croat canton seven because of their obstruction of the implementation
of the Dayton/Paris Peace Agreement.The overall number of dismissals declined in
comparison to the previous year, reflecting the OHR-advocated principle of ownership,
whereby indigenous actors—rather than international supervisors—were
to take the initiative in the implementation of laws.
United Nations
In a resolution adopted June 21, the Security Council extended the mandate of
the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH), including the
International Police Task Force (IPTF), for an additional twelve-month period.The
IPTF strength (around 1,800) remained below the authorized number of 2,057.
UNMIBH completed registration of all Bosnian police personnel in May 2001 and
granted provisional authorization to over 9,300 officers to exercise police powers.
Twenty-three police officers had their authorization withdrawn for professional
misconduct or for human rights violations.UNMIBH expected that by late 2002 all
law enforcement officials would have been appropriately vetted prior to receiving
UNMIBH final certification.
In February, UNMIBH dismissed the police chief and the chief of the crime
department in Bratunac, a municipality in Republika Srpska where incidents
against Bosniac returnees were frequent. In May, UNMIBH also dismissed six topranking
police officials in the Croat part of the federation who refused to accept the
authority of the federal Ministry of Interior during the Croat self-rule campaign.
The U.N. Commission on Human Rights adopted a resolution on April 18 on human rights in parts of southeastern Europe, in which it welcomed the establishment
of non-nationalist parties in Bosnia and in the federation and condemned the
continued harassment of minority returnees. The chairman of the Commission
appointed Jose Cutileiro of Portugal as a special representative to examine the situation
of human rights in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.
In the first conviction on genocide charges before the U.N. International Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Bosnian Serb Army General
Radislav Krstic was sentenced on August 2 to forty-six years in prison.The tribunal
found Krstic responsible for the murder of between 7,000 and 8,000 Bosnian Muslim
men and boys after the fall of Srebrenica in July 1995. On February 22, the ICTY
convicted Bosnian Serbs Dragoljub Kunarac, Radomir Kovac, and Zoran Vukovic
for rape, torture, and enslavement committed in Foca during the Bosnian war.This
case marked the first time in history that an international tribunal brought charges
expressly for crimes of sexual violence against women. The decision also marked
the first time that the ICTY found rape and enslavement to be crimes against
humanity. On August 1, the tribunal sentenced Stevan Todorovic, former police
chief in Bosanski Samac, to ten years in prison for persecution of Bosniacs and
Croats in 1992. Bosnian Croats Dario Kordic and Mario Cerkez were sentenced on
February 26 to prison sentences for crimes committed against Bosniac civilians in
1992 and 1993.
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
The OSCE-chaired Provisional Election Commission (PEC) organized general
elections on November 11, 2000. In response to the illegal referendum on Croat
self-rule on the day of the elections, the PEC’s Election Appeals Sub-Commission
(EASC) nullified the mandates of the two HDZ candidates who received the most
votes among the party’s candidates for each of five cantonal assemblies. The EASC
also banned reallocation of their mandates to other candidates. The EASC ceased
operations in April 2001 as part of the process of transferring responsibilities from
the PEC to the permanent Bosnia and Herzegovina election commission, which
commenced its work on November 20, 2001.
On April 10, the OSCE Mission released its 2000 Free Media Help Line report,
including a detailed review of cases reported to the Help Line in 2000. The report
established that the most cases of threats and intimidation reported in 2000 were
committed by government or public officials (34.6 percent), followed by anonymous
and unaffiliated individuals (with 25 percent each).
Council of Europe
At a November 2000 session the Committee of Ministers of the Council of
Europe welcomed the progress achieved by Bosnia and Herzegovina toward meeting
the criteria for accession to the Council of Europe and added that further
progress was needed, including the adoption of an electoral law. The ministers in
May 2001 invited the newly established governmental structures in the country to accelerate the implementation of the required conditions for membership. The
Bosnia and Herzegovina House of Representatives adopted an Election Law on
August 21. On September 27, the Political Affairs Committee of the Council of
Europe Parliamentary Assembly recommended that the Committee of Ministers
invite Bosnia and Herzegovina to become a council member.
European Union
The Presidency of the European Union condemned unilateral moves of the
Croat nationalist parties in March to establish a self-governing structure.The Presidency
also supported the decision of the high representative to remove Bosnian
Croat leader Ante Jelavic from his post in the Bosnian presidency. At meetings in
May and June in Brussels, the E.U. General Affairs Council condemned all forms of
separatism and nationalist violence in Bosnia and Herzegovina and supported the
high representative’s responses to these developments.During a visit to Sarajevo in
May, Chris Patten, the E.U. External Relations Commissioner, and Anna Lindh,
Foreign Minister of Sweden (which held the E.U.Presidency at the time), stated that
Bosnia’s accession to the Council of Europe was a precondition to further negotiations
on a stabilization and association agreement with the European Union.
United States
During the year, the United States reduced its contingent in the Stabilization
Force from 4,400 troops to 3,300. A spokesman for the U.S. contingent stated in
early October that U.S. troops in Bosnia would not be pulled out to engage in the
U.S.-led military campaign in Afghanistan. State Department officials refused to
meet with Republika Srpska President Mirko Sarovic and Vice President Dragan
Cavic during their visit to Washington in April. Sarovic and Cavic are leaders of the
Serbian Democratic Party, which was founded by indicted war criminal Radovan
Karadzic. The United States also endorsed the elections of a non-nationalist
national government and expressed support for the decision of the High Representative
to dismiss Ante Jelavic from office.
DynCorp, Inc., the U.S. contractor responsible for employing U.S. IPTF officers
and SFOR contractors, faced two lawsuits for wrongful termination after dismissing
two DynCorp employees who raised allegations that DynCorp personnel had
engaged in human trafficking-related activities. The lawsuits were still pending at
the time of this writing.
