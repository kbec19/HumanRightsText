 SINGAPORE
 Singapore is governed under a parliamentary system
 modeled generally along British lines. Members of
 Parliament are elected to maximum five-year terms on
 the basis of universal adult suffrage. The People's
 Action Party (PAP) completely dominates the Parliament,
 having carried all 69 seats in the 1976 election. The
 government enjoys broad popular support; its civil
 service is efficient and honest, and its leadership
 free from corruption. In economic and social matters,
 its record of enhancing the material well-being of all
 its citizens is excellent.
 A multiracial society with a dominant majority of
 Chinese but having both Malay and Indian minorities,
 Singapore has experienced communal tensions in the
 past. It has also been subject to acts of terrorism
 by elements of the Communist Party of Malaya.
 The Government of Singapore cites both the threat of
 insurgency and the possibility of renewed communal
 conflict as justification for emergency legislation
 which makes legal the arrest and detention without
 trial of persons suspected of subversive or other
 activities that threaten general civic order.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is not condoned by the Government of Singapore.
 However, an Amnesty International report dated February
 1976 cites allegations that internal security detainees
 are subjected to intensive questioning in cold air-
 conditioned cells and forced to do strenuous exercises
 resulting in strain and fatigue. It is difficult to
 verify such reports.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 We are unaware of any instances of such treatment or
 punishment by the government (unless one were to so
 define caning, which was introduced by the British and
 is still employed as a punishment for certain crimes).

 The death penalty exists in Singapore but executions
 are rare.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The government makes recurring use of detention without
 trial in security and some criminal cases under the
 Internal Security Act (ISA) and the Criminal (Detention)
 Law.
 The Internal Security'Act is a preventive detention
 statute inherited from the British colonial administra-
 tion. Its use is justified by the Government of
 Singapore in connection with the Communist Party of
 Malaya (CPM) which is active both in Malaysia and in
 Singapore. The CPM maintains an operational capacity
 in Singapore where it recruits cadre for its armed
 insurgency in Malaysia. In the application of the ISA,
 however, the definition of a "security case" has been
 extended to include at times the following categories
 of individuals: those who have had contact with
 communism and some elements of the radical left but who
 are not necessarily themselves supporters of violent
 revolution; those who portray Singapore as a state in
 which individual liberties are curtailed or the
 Singapore Government as undemocratic, totalitarian,
 autocratic and "oppressive"; and those journalists whose
 reporting is considered by the Government of Singapore
 to be slanted and therefore capable of being exploited
 by communists.
 The Internal Security Act permits the issuance of a
 two-year renewable detention order which is subjected
 to automatic review at 12-month intervals. Prime
 Minister Lee has acknowledged publicly that the 12
 persons currently being detained for long terms have
 not been released because they refuse to abjure either
 forceful overthrow of the government or support of the
 CPM.
 Perhaps 200 persons, approximately 70 of whom are
 believed to be narcotics traffickers, are detained
 under another law, the Criminal Law (Temporary Provi-
 sions Act), which is designed for use and used mainly
 against members of criminal secret societies and
 
 
 narcotics traffickers. These may be a few persons
 held for security reasons within that group. A written
 order for temporary detention for one year may be
 issued by the Home Minister. Each order must be reviewed
 within 25 days by an advisory committee which is required
 to submit a written report to the President.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Singaporean judicial system operates in accordance
 with the basic tenets, practices, and precedents of
 British jurisprudence. The right to a fair, public
 trial is generally observed, except for persons detained
 under the Internal Security Act and the Criminal
 (Detention) Law.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is observed except
 as to persons arrested or detained under the Internal
 Security Act and Criminal (Detention) Law. In other
 cases, the Singapore authorities can easily obtain a
 search warrant and do so before entering and searching
 a dwelling place.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Singapore's record in fulfilling the basic needs of its
 people is remarkable by any yardstick and has received
 global acclaim. The government has an image of rigid
 honesty and has enshrined the work ethic for itself and
 its citizens (over half of whom are housed in well-
 designed apartments which the government has built
 largely over the last decade). The standard' of living
 has risen steadily and has become the second highest in
 Asia, after Japan. There is virtually no illiteracy and
 both medical care and education through the university
 level are of high quality. Even during the recessionary
 period earlier in the decade, Singapore maintained a
 steady and impressive net economic growth. Singapore
 currently has an unemployment rate of slightly less than
 four percent. The economy is essentially based on free
 
 
 enterprise. In economic and social matters, Singapore's
 overall record of providing for the material well being
 of its citizens is among the best in the world.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Singapore, although preponderantly Chinese, is a multi-
 racial society. There is freedom of religion. However,
 freedom of thought, speech, press and assembly are cur-
 tailed in several important areas. First, like neighbor-
 ing Malaysia, Singapore forbids activities or public
 statements which might arouse communal tensions between
 the different ethnic groups in the multiracial society,
 especially friction between the dominant Chinese and the
 Malay minority. The government has invoked the Internal
 Security Act to arrest and detain two persons accused of
 arousing communal tensions. Communist political activi-
 ties are proscribed. The government thus promptly detains
 suspected communist activists under the Internal Security
 Act. Lastly, the definition of "security cases" is
 sufficiently broad that it has the effect of tending
 to stifle dissent.
 Singapore has approximately 210,000 workers organized
 into trade unions. Some 200,000 of these belong to the
 National Trade Union Congress which is informally but
 closely associated with the ruling People's Action
 Party (PAP). Several of the top leaders of the NTUC
 are members of parliament.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 To the best of our knowledge, freedom of movement,
 foreign travel, and emigration are not constrained by
 the Government of Singapore. ï¿½
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Singapore is a republic with a parliamentary system of
 government organized along British lines. The govern-
 ment is controlled by the People's Action Party headed
 
 
 272
 by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. Membership in the PAP
 is open to non-communist Singaporeans of any race. Non-
 communist, non-racist parties are free to organize but
 no opposition representatives were elected to the
 present parliament. Members of parliament, which con-
 sists of 69 members, are elected to maximum five-year
 terms on the basis of compulsory universal adult
 suffrage.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 In general, Singapore rejects foreign criticism. For
 example, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew withdrew the
 People's Action Party from the Socialist International
 when one of the other member parties criticized
 Singapore's use of the Internal Security Act. The
 Department is not aware of any requests to investigate
 human rights concerns in Singapore.
