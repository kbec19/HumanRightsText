 NICARAGUA
 For most of its modern history Nicaragua has had
 a formally democratic governmental structure but
 actual political power usually has been tightly con-
 trolled by a few hands. Following the formation
 of the National Guard in the 1930s, executive control
 became more absolute. It has been wielded by the
 Somoza family through the 'Presidency, the command
 of the Guard, or both. The regime has maintained
 control over the electoral process and has restricted
 the avenues of electoral opposition. Until this
 year, stability was maintained, but at the price
 of growing and increasingly alienated political dis-
 sent. The economy expanded, but with continuing
 severe disparities in the distribution of benefits.
 The assassination on January 10, 1978 of Dr. Pedro
 Joaquin Chamorro, the most prominent opposition leader,
 sparked a wave of public protest against the Govern-
 ment. The nation's private industry and worker organi-
 zations staged a widely observed two-week shutdown.
 These manifestations of popular discontent were spawned
 by the longevity of the Somoza "dynasty", allegations
 of official corruption and favoritism, abuses by
 the National Guard and economic inequalities.
 In August, the leftist Sandinista National Liberation
 Front (FSLN) forcibly seized control of the National
 Palace, taking many hostages, including the members
 of the Chamber of Deputies. After obtaining publica-
 tion of several manifestos, the promise of a large
 amount of money and safe conduct for themselves and
 other FSLN prisoners, the Sandinistas released the
 hostages. Shortly thereafter, a coalition of political
 parties and trade unions, called the Broad Opposition
 Front (FAO), launched another national work stoppage
 seeking the resignation of President Anastasio Somoza.
 The strike was met by arrests. On September 9, the
 FSLN launched a coordinated series of attacks in
 many urban centers, with participation bysympathizers
 
 (299)
 
 
 300
 who were largely young males. On September 12, the
 Government reinstated martial law, which had been
 lifted in 1977, thereby suspending many constitutional
 guarantees and basic civil liberties. In reestablish-
 ing control over several towns, the Government resorted
 to widespread aerial support operations including
 use of rockets and machine gun strafing without effec-
 tive warning or prior evacuation of the civilian ï¿½
 population, which resulted in many non-combatant
 casualties. A large number of the civilian deaths
 are credibly reported to have resulted from summary
 execution during the hostilities.
 A report prepared by the Inter-American Commission
 on Human Rights (IACHR) following its on-site visit
 in October 1978 included a credible finding that
 the Government was responsible for torture and summary
 execution after hostilities had ceased. The Commission
 detailed a "general repression" against males between
 fourteen and twenty-one years of age. The Government
 generally responded that the deceased were guerrillas
 killed in combat. Guerrilla attacks did, in fact,
 continue through the end of the year, with casualties
 on both sides. National Guard reaction also resulted
 in injuries and deaths of civilians in late December.
 In response to opposition preconditions for entering
 into direct discussions with the Government regarding
 a plebiscite on whether Somoza should remain as Presi-
 dent, martial law was lifted on December 7 and an
 amnesty for all prior political offenses was decreed
 on December 16.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity alleging the Person,
 Including Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There have been credible reports of torture. The
 IACHR obtained affidavits alleging numerous instances
 of torture of political detainees before and during
 the September conflict and concluded that "there
 were serious violations of the right to personal
 security by means of tortures and other physical

301
 pressures which were inflicted on numerous detainees."
 The Roman Catholic Church in Nicaragua and Amnesty
 International also have repeatedly condemned torture
 by the National Guard. Although the Government has
 occasionally investigated charges of torture, there
 is no known instance in 1978 of the Government's
 bringing charges against those accused of such treat-
 ment.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been many credible reports, some supported
 by affidavits, of beatings during arrests and inter-
 rogation by the National Guard. mhere is no known
 instance of the Government's bringing charges against
 those accused of such treatment. On the other hand,
 many arrested on politically-related charges have
 stated that they have been well treated while incarcer-
 ated. Prison conditions are generally poor. moreover,
 the extent of amenities available to those detained
 is partially dependent upon their ability to obtain
 material assistance from family and friends.
 C.   Arbitrary Arrest or Punishment
 Arbitrary arrest has occurred frequently over recent
 years. There also remain several hundred unexplained
 disappearances which occurred several years ago during
 rural counter-insurgency operations. During 1978,
 the National Guard arrested more than a thousand
 persons for anti-government activities. In many
 cases they were accused of insurgency or other vio-
 lence. Arrests reached a peak during the August-
 October period when violence was widespread.   Many
 of these persons were freed by military tribunals
 for lack of evidence while martial law was still
 in effect. Some of those tried by the courts in
 the absence of martial law were found innocent, and
 some cases are still being processed. Some arrested
 persons have disappeared and remain unaccounted for.
 Prior to the December general amnesty for all politi-
 cally-related crimes (including insurgency), a local
 non-governmental human rights committee indicated
 
 
 302
 that about 1,300 persons had been arrested by the
 National Guard. Virtually all of those persons were
 freed by the end of the year. Detentions continued
 daily in late December, largely as a result of National
 Guard anti-guerrilla operations.
 Nicaraguan law provides that persons suspected of
 threatening internal security may be held for up
 to ten days before charges are presented or they
 are released. The detention of such persons was
 often not officially acknowledged.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Many Nicaraguans have little faith in the fairness
 of the judicial process, though courts in some cases
 during the year exonerated defendants charged with
 security offenses. Civilian courts continued to
 process civil and ordinary criminal offenses during
 and after periods of martial law. Such trials are
 public.
 During the almost three months of martial law, all
 security offenses were remanded to a military investi-
 gative court. In those cases, where this body had
 not released the defendants on the basis of insuffi-
 cient evidence to warrant prosecution (as it did
 in several cases), the defendants were turned over
 to the civil courts when martial law ended. Due
 to the very slow processing of these cases, none
 had been fully adjudicated when martial law ended.
 Summary decisions by police judges resulted in the
 sentencing of persons to up to six months in jail.
 The requirements for due process were not observed
 and counsel was not provided in these cases. Appeal
 of police court decisions is possible but often is
 time-consuming and fruitless. These facts were cited
 by the IACHR, which found this a violation of the
 right to due process and in particular to the right
 to an adequate defense.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 Search warrants are required by law except when the
 police authorities are in direct pursuit of a criminal,
 
 
 303
 but this requirement has been disregarded in many
 instances. During periods of martial law, the require-
 ment of a warrant is waived. During the September-
 December period of insurgency and martial law, the
 National Guard frequently entered homes, allegedly
 in pursuit of FSLN suspects or in searches for weapons
 caches. The Government reported finding six or seven
 such caches during the latter part of the year.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Nicaragua's economy iS based on agricultural exports
 and has enjoyed an annual growth rate of over six
 percent in recent years with a fiscal year 1978 per
 capita Gross National Product of $830. The benefits
 of this growth have had little impact on the poorest
 of Nicaragua's largely rural people. Life expectancy
 at birth is 53 years and the level of literacy is
 58 percent. The Government has undertaken a comprehen-
 sive rural development program. The implementation
 of the overall program has been adversely affected
 by the political situation, the insurgency and related
 violence, and by the resulting economic downturn.
 Government policies seek to promote increased food
 production, particularly by the small producer.
 It appears that funding for social services and develop-
 ment will be severely reduced in the near future
 as a result of this year's violence and political
 and economic turmoil, however. By the end of 1978,
 the Government's financial position had deteriorated
 to such an extent that new programs were deferred,
 many ongoing development programs were at or near
 a standstill, and funds were barely sufficient to
 meet payrolls.
 Corruption traditionally has diverted Government
 resources away from the poor. This seems to have
 been especially true during the 1975-1977 period
 of martial law and in the wake of large assistance
 transfers after the 1972 earthquake. A 1977 cabinet
 reorganization was attributed in part to widely-publi-
 
 
 cized charges of corruption.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Except during the several weeks of censorship in
 September and October, the press, radio and television
 have been vigorous in reporting divergent opinion
 and commentary. Both the country's largest newspaper
 and its most important provincial newspaper consist-
 ently and severely criticized the Somoza government's
 policies and practices, supported its opponents,
 and regularly publicized complaints of human rights
 abuses.
 The Nicaraguan radio and television code allows the
 Government to fine or suspend those it judges to
 have made "seditious, defamatory or unjustifiably
 alarmist broadcasts." During the year such sanctions
 have been imposed in about two dozen cases against
 the radio stations which have been most vigorously
 anti-government in their news coverage and commentary.
 This practice was most evident euring martial law,
 when radio stations were required to carry a frequent
 government news program. The stations have the right
 of appeal to the Minister of the Interior, but in
 only a few cases have the fines or suspensions been
 withdrawn or reduced after appeal. In December,
 the Government began negotiating with the FAO to
 eliminate the more objectionable features of the
 code-while a congressional committee, established
 in June, continued to explore its revision.
 The labor movement has four national confederations:
 one controlled by the Government, one unaffiliated
 ideologically, one Social Christian-oriented, and
 one controlled by self-styled "Moscow-line" socialists.
 The American Institute for Free Labor Development
 has an active program with the unaffiliated confeder-
 ation. The non-government confederations were active
 members of the Broad Opposition Front. Nicaragua's
 
 
 305
 labor law is designed to provide workers social bene-
 fits and significant protection against arbitrary
 firing. However, the Government has exercised control
 over labor through its power to recognize unions,
 to declare strikes illegal and to rule on the firing
 of workers.
 Freedom of religious belief is respected. However,
 there have been instances of church-state confronta-
 tion, and the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Managua
 and other clergy as well as lay organizations have
 been vocally critical of the Government. The IACHR
 found that "in practice the priests and clergy encoun-
 ter serious restrictions on the exercise of their
 ministry." In September the Archdiocese of'Managua
 accused the National Guard of abusing priests and
 machine-gunning churches and parish residences which
 were allegedly used in urban sniper operations.
 Three well-known Roman Catholic priests publicly
 supported or joined the FSLN guerrilla movement,
 and another was recently killed while fighting in
 a guerrilla group. One foreign priest was deported.
 There was extensive use of the right of assembly
 except when martial law or a state of siege was in
 effect. The "Group of 12", among other opposition
 organizations, held several public rallies during
 the summer.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, For-
 eign Travel and Emigration
 As a result of the turmoil during the year, many
 hundreds of persons sought voluntary political exile.
 Some returned clandestinely to Nicaragua to fight
 with the FSLN. There are no known involuntary exiles,
 and even those voluntary exiles charged with insurgent
 or terrorist activity prior to the date of the December
 amnesty are presumably no longer subject to prosecution
 if they return. Thousands of refugees fled to Honduras
 and Costa Rica during and after the September battles.
 Movement within the country was unrestricted except
 for security checkpoints where vehicles and travelers
 were searched for weapons or subversive materials.
 The National Guard wounded or killed several persons
 
 
 306
 who were violating a curfew during martial law.
 Emigration and foreign travel are unhindered except
 for the requirement of an exit permit. A passport
 or exit permit may be denied to persons against whom
 a legal action is pending or who have not paid their
 taxes. Outspoken opponents of the regime occasionally
 encountered greater than normal delays or harassment
 in obtaining their travel documents.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Pro-
 cess
 The Constitution provides for universal suffrage
 for those over twenty-one; persons with certain marital
 and educational status can vote at a younger age.
 It also provides for a multi-party system. However,
 the electoral law makes it difficult for parties
 other than the Liberals (PLNI) and Conservatives (PCN)
 to obtain legal recognition. The Conservatives are
 constitutionally guaranteed forty percent of the
 seats in Congress as well as minority representation
 in the judiciary, the supreme electoral tribunal
 and all governmental entities including international
 delegations. There is a plethora of small political
 parties, movements or affinity groups. Sixteen of
 these groups joined forces in April to form the FAO,
 the opposition political group with which the inter-
 national mediation team, comprised of representatives
 from the United States, the Dominican Republic and
 Guatemala, has principally dealt in its efforts to
 negotiate a democratic and peaceful political settle-
 ment with the Government.
 The lack of effective freedom to challenge the Somoza
 regime's control over governmental power through
 the political process has been a continuing source
 of discontent. Opposition politicians and many outside
 observers feel strongly that the electoral processs
 is subject to fraud and manipulation. In the municipal
 elections in February, with widespread opposition
 abstention, the Liberals won all of the posts at
 stake. There were credible allegations of substantial
 distortion of the number of registered voters who
 actually cast their ballots.

 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A private body known as the Nicaraguan Commission
 for Human Rights documented numerous allegations
 of human rights abuses. Although some of its members
 were detained for investigation of anti-government
 activities, there has been no direct attempt by the
 Government to impede or discontinue its operations.
 Amnesty International has-not investigated conditions
 in Nicaragua since 1976, when it received only limited
 cooperation from the Government. The International
 Committee of the Red Cross has continued to have
 access to jails and prisons, but encountered serious
 limitations imposed by the National Guard on its
 freedom of operation during the September fighting.
 The Government authorized a visit by the IACHR to
 Nicaragua in October immediately following the FSLN-
 led urban insurrection. The IACHR documented wide-
 spread violations of human rights as described else-
 where in this report. The Commission concluded that
 the Nicaraguan Government was responsible for "serious,
 persistent and generalized violations" of human rights.
 The Government denounced the IACHR reports for ignoring
 charges of atrocities by the FSLN insurgents, but,
 with one temporary local exception, it did not inter-
 fere with the IACHR's investigation. The Government
 pledged to take remedial steps where and if the charges
 of the IACHR proved to be true, but there is little
 precedent in Nicaragua for prosecution of significant
 human rights violators.
 Nicaragua has not ratified-the American Convention
 on Human Rights.
