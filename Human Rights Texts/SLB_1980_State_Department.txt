 SOLOMON ISLANDS
 The Solomon Islands is one of the larger mini-states in
 the South Pacific with a homogeneous population of 225,000.
 It is a parliamentary democracy. The capital, Honiara, is
 the only urban area. Over 90 percent of the population
 lives in rural villages. Most Solomon Islanders still are
 deeply associated with traditional Melanesian social mores
 and maintain strong roots in village life.
 The Solomon Islands achieved independence on July 7, 1978.
 Since then, democratic institutions established during the
 colonial period are being integrated with custom and
 traditional practices; substantial government powers are
 being devolved to the provincial and local levels.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law and custom in the Solomon
 Islands. No reports of torture have been received in 1980.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is
 illegal and not practiced or condoned. Capital punishment*
 was abolished in 1966. Criminal law is embodied in a
 penal code. Treatment of prisoners is fair and humane.
 There have been no charges of mistreatment.
 c. Disappearances
 This is non-existent in the Solomon Islands.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Impriconment
 There are no political prisoners in the Solomons. Habeas
 corpus exists and is honored in practice. Preventive
 detention does not exist.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A right to a fair public trial is guaranteed by law, and
 is honored in practice. Defendants are entitled to counsel
 and may consult with counsel freely'and in private. The
 constitution provides for a public solicitor whose function
 is to provide legal aid, advice and help to the public,
 especially those charged with criminal offenses. Defendants
 are made fully aware of the charges against them, and their
 lawyers can inform themselves of the evidence on which
 charges are based.
 The Solomon Islands court system is independent of executive
 or military control. There are no special courts to deal
 with security or political offenses. The high court has a
 wide review authority over the lower courts. An ombudsman
 investigates complaints against the government.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 There is respect for the sanctity of the home and search
 warrants are required as a matter of law. Illegal entries
 of the home are not condoned.

 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Solomons' government has emphasized development of
 rural areas and decentralization of government functions.
 Adequate food, shelter, health care and education are all
 objectives of the national development plan, and modest
 progress is being made in carrying out these objectives
 within the constraints of the budget. There is a strong
 commitment to capitalist enterprise, and the government
 actively encourages foreign investment. No data are availa-
 ble at this time on such investment, but progress has been
 slow given the geographical isolation of much of the country
 and the need for the Solomon Islands, which has been indepen-
 dent for only two years, to reorganize its delivery of
 social services. Nevertheless, the Solomons are committed
 to provision of vital needs by the government.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Except for the government-controlled station, free speech
 and free press are guaranteed and observed in practice.
 There are both government and privately published news-
 papers. Religions are freely practiced. There are no
 impediments to assembly or to freedom of association.
 Private newspapers operate freely. There is no censorship
 of the press. There have been no violations of freedom of
 the press reported this year.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Solomon Islanders are free to travel within the country
 and abroad. Passport fees are not excessive.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There is universal adult suffrage for citizens 18 and older.
 An electoral commission oversees registration and ensures
 fair elections. A bitterly contested national election in
 August 1980 saw the re-emergence of political parties as a
 key factor in the country's political process. The
 unicameral parliament of 38 members meets regularly.
 Women have equal standing and play a significant role in all
 arenas. Under law there is no discrimination by sex.
 There is an active trade union movement with rights to
 organize, bargain and strike.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no such allegations against the Solomon
 Islands government nor any requests for investigations. The
 Solomons has not acceded to the International Covenant on
 Civil and Political Rights.
