RWANDA
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Rwanda appeared to be moving towards greater democracy by decentralizing
the administration, drafting a new constitution, and holding local elections. But at
the same time the government suppressed a new political party and imposed new
limits on civil society. The dominant Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) was permitted
to recruit extensively while other political parties were banned from any local
activities. Justice for the 1994 genocide that killed at least half a million Tutsi
advanced slowly in both national and international jurisdictions. Elections for
judges under a new system of “popular”justice called gacaca spurred hopes of faster
resolution of the cases of over 100,000 people still jailed on accusations of genocide,
but trials under the new system were unlikely before mid-2002.
Rwanda professed commitment to ending the war in neighboring Congo, but its
troops, allied with the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD), intensified combat
in the eastern provinces of North and South Kivu during September and October.
At the same time Rwandan troops were reported fighting rebels inside Burundi,
some of them Rwandan, some Burundian, and late in the year troop movements
fed speculation about possible war with Uganda.
Rwandan army soldiers assisted their RCD allies in abducting and forcibly
recruiting children and men to serve in the RCD armed forces. Rwandan military
and civilian authorities continued to use some children as part of the official paramilitary
Local Defense Force which sometimes engaged in combat.
From May through July, Rwandan troops fought and defeated the rebel Rwandan
Liberation Army (ALIR) which had crossed from bases in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) into northwestern Rwanda. The Rwandan army reportedly
killed some 2,000 combatants and captured about the same number who were
then detained for “re-education” in “solidarity” camps. In contrast to previous
practices, neither Rwandan government soldiers nor ALIR rebels targeted civilians
during these months of combat.The ALIR forces had several hundred child soldiers
in their ranks, some of whom served in combat. In September and October, rebel
combatants fought several skirmishes with Rwandan army soldiers in southwestern
Rwanda.Assailants, said by the government to be rebels, ambushed a vehicle in
that region and killed one passenger.
In March, Rwandans voted, generally without incident, for district councils. A
complicated system of indirect elections gave disproportionate importance to the
vote of officials,many of whom had taken office since 1999. In some places RPF representatives
and some officials manipulated the registration of candidates, some 45
percent of whom ran unopposed. Party and administrative officials also exerted
pressure on voters in some cases, ordinarily in favor of the incumbent.More than
80 percent of incumbent district mayors were re-elected. The law organizing these
local elections prohibited political party activity in apparent violation of the constitution. Parties generally observed a moratorium on grass-roots activities, as
demanded by the RPF. Ignoring both the electoral law and the moratorium, the
RPF recruited new members and did electoral campaigning in some areas. It was
not called to account for its activities.
While a commission worked to prepare a new constitution which would supposedly
guarantee political freedoms, the government did not honor those guaranteed
under the existing fundamental law. In June, former president Pasteur
Bizimungu sought to organize a new political party, as permitted by the current
constitution. But the government declared the party illegal and twice put Bizimungu
under house arrest for brief periods after he had spoken with journalists.
Street gangs attacked Bizimungu and another prominent supporter of the new
party and several other founding members were threatened and felt obliged to
resign to protect themselves.
Others said to have been critical of the government were assassinated or fled the
country. A well-known military officer and diplomat, Alphonse Mbayire, was shot
in the head twenty-eight times by a RPF soldier in February.Although the assassin
was identified by several eyewitnesses, he escaped arrest.At least two other military
officers “disappeared” during the year. One,Major Alexis Ruzindana, was believed
to have been assassinated as well. Both Mbayire and Ruzindana were reportedly
suspected of dissatisfaction with the government and of contacts with dissidents
outside the country. These killings resembled that of leading genocide survivor
Assiel Kabera in 2000, a crime for which no one was charged.
A military officer of the former government’s army, taken into custody by Rwandan
military authorities in the DRC last year, was later traced to military detention
facilities in Gisenyi and Kigali, but subsequently “disappeared.” Civilians last
known to have been in custody also “disappeared” during the year, including a
Congolese tailor last known to have been detained in a military camp in May. A
farmer from Kigali Rural was reportedly last seen at the home of an influential
member of the RPF in February 2001 with whom he had a dispute. His family
received no official help in locating him.
A number of dissaffected RPA soldiers fled to Uganda where the Rwandan government
said they were organizing rebel forces to attack it. Rwanda accused
Uganda of aiding these efforts, one of the reasons for heightened tensions and
rumors of war between Rwanda and Uganda near the end of the year. In April, seven
jurists were detained for several weeks without charge, all of them returned former
refugees from Uganda and reportedly accused of links with Rwandan dissidents
there.
Several prominent civilians known to have been critical of the government also
fled Rwanda. They included a former cabinet minister who was Hutu and a bank
president who was Tutsi. In the latter case, the government accused the financier of
fraud and sought his arrest on an international warrant.A colonel suspected of having
favored Bizimungu’s new party was arrested when the new party was suppressed;
he was convicted of financial misconduct in a family affair and sentenced
to prison. A former parliamentarian who was arrested on charges of fraud in 2000
shortly after he issued a statement criticizing the government remained in prison
without trial.
In April, the government published a new law giving authorities broad powers
to control the management, finances, and projects of local and international nongovernmental
organizations. Ministerial directives to implement the law, under
discussion at the end of the year, seemed meant to tighten control further.Authorities
sent police to disrupt meetings of two human rights organizations in June and
August. Security agents detained and interrogated representatives of the Rwanda
Debt Relief Network in September after they made critical statements about
poverty in Rwanda. Authorities accused these civil society actors of representing
political parties and of inciting ethnic divisions.
The government permitted numerous journals to publish, some of them representing
independent voices, and granted the Voice of America FM broadcast rights
in Rwanda.But security agents called in staff of one critical newspaper twelve times
for questioning and the journal ceased publication of its English edition. Rwandan
journalists who interviewed Bizimungu when he tried to establish his new party
were questioned by security agents and intimidated into handing over a tape
recording of the interview. Authorities also threatened action against the British
Broadcasting Corporation after it aired an interview with Bizimungu.
With well over 100,000 persons still detained on accusations of genocide, the
government gave new attention to improving the delivery of justice. In April, the
gov-ernment published a law creating more than 11,000 jurisdictions for gacaca, an
innovative system of popular justice. Supposedly inspired by the spirit of local conflict-
resolution practices, the system in fact reflects the highly centralized administrative
system and will work from materials prepared by prosecutors.According to
the law, neither accused nor victim has the right to counsel.Nor has the accused any
right to appeal the categorization of his or her crime into one of four levels of gravity,
a designation with major consequences for punishment. Those assigned to category
one by gacaca jurisdictions are to be tried in regular courts and will likely be
sentenced to death if found guilty.Despite the absence of some basic guarantees of
due process, the innovative system offered the only hope of trial within the foreseeable
future for the tens of thousands now suffering inhumane conditions in prisons
and communal lockups. The election of more than 200,000 gacaca judges in October
raised expectations that trials would soon begin,but proceedings seemed unlikely
before mid-2002 at the earliest. Judges must be trained and prosecutors, over-burdened
with work in the regular courts, must prepare case files and summaries of
them from which the gacaca jurisdictions will work.The legislature must pass a law
on the indemnization of victims and authorities must work out implementation of
the community labor which may be imposed as punishment on the guilty.
Throughout the year authorities made some efforts to deal with the thousands
of detainees who still have no specific charges against them, sometimes after seven
years in prison. Prosecutors continued the practice begun in late 2000 of bringing
such persons before their home communities to ask for testimonies against them,
in the absence of which the persons were provisionally freed.Hundreds were liberated
in this way. Authorities also encouraged detainees to confess in a plea-bargaining
procedure which was meant to shorten trials but seemed unlikely to speed
proceedings greatly since prosecutors must establish the validity of each confession
and over 15,000 confessions awaited examination.
As of March 2001, 5,310 persons had been tried on charges of genocide in the
formal court system, some 17 percent of whom were acquitted.Courts worked at a
slightly faster pace in the two last years and sentenced fewer of the convicted to
death. From 1996 to 1999 more than 30 percent of those found guilty were sentenced
to die, but in 2000 only 8.5 percent received this penalty and no one was executed.
Despite the widespread prevalence of rape during the genocide, few accused
have been tried on this charge, in part because the predominantly male judicial personnel
showed little concern for such prosecutions, in part because victims hesitated
to come forward.
Hundreds of minors under the age of fourteen at the time of their supposed
crime and as such not criminally responsible under Rwandan law were held in
prison on charges of genocide until December 2000. After years of promises,
authorities finally released over four hundred to a “solidarity camp” for re-education.
Hundreds of others remained illegally in detention until September 2001
when they were sent for “re-education;” they were released in November. Thousands
of detainees who were aged fourteen to eighteen at the time of their alleged
crimes remained in detention.Although supposed to benefit from priority in processing,
most did not.
In several cases persons tried, acquitted, and released were later re-arrested after
public protest against the verdicts.Eight detainees acquitted in Butare in December
2000 were never released and were to be tried a second time on “new facts.” In
November 2001, one died, still in detention.Magistrates involved in their acquittal
were transferred to other posts with the result that no judgments in genocide cases
were issued in that jurisdiction in the first quarter of 2001. Three judges arrested in
2000 on charges of genocide remained in jail; two had served on panels that had
acquitted accused persons in well-publicized cases prior to their own arrests.
Authorities recognized corruption in the judiciary as widespread and serious
and called on judicial personnel to reform. Both prosecutors and judges were
accused of accepting bribes, either to free the accused or to assure their conviction
regardless of guilt.
In March the attorney general issued a revised list of category one genocide suspects,
those charged with the worst crimes. Some eight hundred persons had been
added to the previous list issued in 1999, bringing the total to nearly 2,900.Among
the additions was Pierre-Celestin Rwigema, prime minister of Rwanda from 1995
to 2000 and currently living in exile. Also listed was Col. Pierre Habimana of the
former Rwandan army, in the hands of Rwandan authorities since July 2001 but not
yet charged with genocide as of late 2001.
Authorities did little to protect children from abuse and exploitation and in the
capital local officials supervised a harsh campaign to rid Kigali of thousands of
street children.Police and members of the Local Defense Force forcibly rounded up
the children and sometimes beat them before detaining them in ill-equipped centers.
An estimated 400,000 orphans lived in child-headed households or in unofficial
fostering arrangements.Many were exploited as domestic laborers or lost their
property to adults.
The government debated a new policy on land holdings while at the local level
disputes over acquisition of large holdings by the powerful continued. Authorities slowed implementation of the forced villagization which had displaced hundreds
of thousands of persons in previous years.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Authorities harassed the Rwandan League for the Promotion and Defense of
Human Rights (LIPRODHOR), the most important human rights organization in
the country, after it published a press release criticizing conditions at one prison.A
journalist lost his job at the national radio after giving an internationally-broadcast
interview about the press release.Authorities threatened a LIPRODHOR representative
with arrest in one province and banned educational programs by the organization
in three provinces. Government officials attempted to interfere in staffing
decisions and blocked disbursement of funds granted LIPRODHOR by an international
agency.
Police disrupted an initial meeting of a new human rights organization, Justice
and Peace, but authorities later permitted the new group to meet.
The National Human Rights Commission expanded both staff and activities. In
its first substantial report on the human rights situation, the commission showed
some independence from authorities and detailed a number of cases of abuses.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
As the international community became increasingly critical of the Rwandan
role in the Congo war, the U.N. Security Council in October called upon Rwanda
and other signatories to the Lusaka Accords to implement their commitments,
including withdrawing their troops. The council also urged all parties to end their
continuing human rights abuses. In April a panel of experts named by the Security
Council published a report documenting the illegal exploitation of Congolese
resources by Rwandans and other foreign actors and suggesting that economic
rather than security considerations explained the continued presence of Rwandan
troops in the eastern DRC. After those criticized contested the findings, the Security
Council mandated a second report. Issued in November, it confirmed the original
conclusions regarding Rwandan conduct and added new criticism of
Zimbabwe and others.
The U.N. Commission on Human Rights ended the mandate of its special representative
for Rwanda.The result of extensive lobbying by Rwandan delegates, this
decision underestimated the gravity of continuing human rights abuses in Rwanda.
The European Union pressed for an end to the Congo war, sending a high level
delegation to the region in November. It budgeted some $100 million in assistance
to Rwanda for 2000-2001 but not all of that amount was spent. It granted $1.2 million
to the National Human Rights Commission to help it monitor gacaca proceedings.
Despite reservations about Rwandan involvement in the Congo war, international
actors expressed continued confidence in the Rwandan domestic political and economic situation.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) released U.S.$ 12
million for a three year poverty reduction plan and the World Bank, the IMF, the
African Development Fund, and the International Fund for Agricultural Development
cancelled $25 million of Rwandan foreign debt. France, in the past critical of
the Rwandan government, showed new willingness to support such international
aid measures after Foreign Minister Herbert Vedrine was well received in Kigali.
Germany granted $16.8 million for development and China granted $3.6 million
and forgave more than $16 million in Rwandan debt.The United Kingdom,still the
most enthusiastic supporter of the Rwandan government, continued its ten-year
program of $70 million in general budget support.
In the United States the Bush administration adopted a more neutral position in
the Great Lakes crisis coincidental with its general reduction of engagement elsewhere
in Africa and joined other donors in criticizing Rwandan involvement in the
Congo war. Embassy staff closely monitored the conduct of both Rwandan troops
and ALIR rebels during the combat in northwestern Rwanda in May through July,
thus encouraging observation of international humanitarian law. Permitted to
establish FM service for the Voice of America (VOA) in Rwanda, the U.S. failed to
criticize publicly government intimidation of the press even though a VOA journalist
was among those harassed. Although State Department officials privately
expressed more reservations about the Rwandan government than in the past, the
U.S. provided $14 million in development assistance and another $1.5 million
under the Great Lakes Justice Initiative.
The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda had fifty-two persons in custody,
eight of whom had been tried and convicted of genocide. One accused person
was acquitted in 2001. The tribunal continued to suffer from serious management
problems and was increasingly criticized for its expense and delays in delivering
justice. A Belgian court found four persons guilty of genocide in the first jury trial
held anywhere in connection with the 1994 slaughter and sentenced them to prison
terms ranging from twelve to twenty years.
