KAZAKHSTAN
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
As allegations of corruption against top Kazakh officials persisted in the international
press, the government continued to tighten control over political life and the media in 2001. Journalists, editors, and opposition party activists critical of the
government, especially of corruption, faced attacks, criminal charges, and other
forms of persecution.At the same time, a government tax amnesty came into effect
for those who transferred money from abroad back to Kazakhstan.Opposition parties
said the measure legalized money laundering. In a progressive move, authorities
lifted the longstanding requirement that citizens request an exit visa to leave the
country.
The government resisted calls for electoral reform and hounded the political
opposition. Former prime minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin, Nazarbaev’s one-time
rival and leader of the Republican People’s Party of Kazakhstan (RNPK), was tried
in absentia on charges of corruption and tax evasion and sentenced to ten years’
imprisonment in September. On July 15, Kazakh officials prevented Amirzhan
Qosanov, the acting chair of the RNPK’s executive committee, together with opposition
journalist Yermurat Bapi, from boarding a flight to the United States. They
were due to testify at a U.S. congressional hearing on human rights in Central Asia.
At the hearing itself, a Kazakh embassy official attempted to subpoena Kazhegeldin
for a criminal trial in Kazakhstan.
The deputy chairman of the Azamat (Citizen) Party, Platon Pak, was hospitalized
on January 30, after three unidentified people broke into his apartment and
stabbed him. In February, unidentified assailants beat Alexander Shushannikov, of
the Lad Slavic Movement, in the town of Ust-Kamenogorsk.
The government did not fulfill President Nazarbaev’s pledge to implement recommendations
made in 1999 by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) on electoral reform. The lack of progress on electoral reforms
prompted four opposition parties in February to withdraw from a joint working
group with the government, organized with the support of the OSCE, on electoral
reform. One party also withdrew from a roundtable discussion on electoral reform
in May, citing the government’s failure to adopt a new elections law.
In February, Temirtas Tleulesov, an author of two books on corruption in
Shymkent, was tried in absentia and sentenced to two years of imprisonment for
“hooliganism.” The charges arose out of a 1999 incident in which bank security
guards seriously beat Tleulesov in Shymkent. Following Tleulesov’s conviction, the
municipal authorities reportedly banned demonstrations planned for February 22
in support of the author.
The independent print and broadcast media suffered constant harassment and
repression.Marina Soloveva, the former director of Ust-Kamenogorsk independent
television, was attacked on March 6 by several men, resulting in a broken arm.
Police investigators decided that no crime had taken place and charged Soloveva
with making false accusations. Gulzhan Ergalieva, a journalist affiliated with the
political opposition, and her husband and son were severely beaten and robbed in
their Almaty home on March 1. Shortly before this incident, Ergalieva had strongly
criticized the government’s participation in an electoral reform working group.
Yermurat Bapi, the editor-in-chief of the independent newspaper SolDat
(whose name is a variant of Dat, Let Me Speak, a paper closed last year) was found
guilty on April 3 of insulting the honor and dignity of President Nazarbaev.He was
sentenced to a one-year prison term, but was released under a general amnesty.The charges related to an article published alleging that President Nazarbaev and other
Kazakh officials had been funneling millions of U.S. dollars from Kazakhstan into
Swiss bank accounts. The authorities confiscated the edition of the newspaper
before distribution. No publishing house would print SolDat for eight months
prior to the trial.
Bigeldy Gabdullin, editor of the opposition newspaper XXI Vek (21st Century),
faced criminal defamation charges following the publication in October 2000 of
two articles alleging corruption by President Nazarbaev. However, on April 6 the
prosecutor’s office issued a press release stating that it had dropped the case.
Reportedly, XXI Vek has not been able to resume publication. On January 18, the
staff of Respublika-2000 again received violent threats after the publication of an
article about corruption; in September 2000, its editor-in-chief, Lira Baisetova, was
beaten after the newspaper had published a similar article.
On April 17, the Parliament passed restrictive amendments to the Law on Mass
Media,which had been severely criticized by local and international organizations,
including the OSCE. The law brought Internet sites under its regulation and limited
the transmission of foreign television and radio programs, requiring foreign
material to be reduced to 20 percent of all available airtime by January 2003. The
legislation sparked protests by private television stations that relied heavily on the
retransmission of Russian television and could force the closure of smaller stations.
Intolerance of nontraditional religious groups continued throughout the
country. In March, two Baptists from Atyrau faced fabricated criminal charges,
which church members claimed were aimed at stopping their missionary activity.
In Kulsary, a small Baptist church received a prosecutor’s order, dated May 2,
declaring the church illegal due to lack of registration. Three U.S. students found
guilty of illegal missionary activity were fined and ordered to leave the country.The
Taraz procuracy sought, unsuccessfully, to ban Jehovah’s Witnesses’ activity.
Following the general crackdown in the region against independent Islam, four
alleged members of Hizb ut-Tahrir were arrested while distributing leaflets calling
for the reestablishment of an Islamic Caliphate in Central Asia. On May 10, two of
the defendants were sentenced to twenty-two and seventeen months’ imprisonment,
respectively, and the two others were released under a general amnesty.
Prison conditions remained horrific in Kazakhstan, which had one of the highest
rates of imprisonment in the world. Even after an amnesty early in the year
reportedly led to the release of 26,729 prisoners, the prison population in 2001 grew
to 84,000 by the end of April.
On April 13, prosecutors in Kyrgyzstan reportedly announced that they had
arrested a man on charges of selling Kyrgyz citizens as “slaves” to work on plantations
in Kazakhstan. A former plantation laborer claimed in the press that thousands
of Kyrgyz citizens were being used as slaves in Kazakhstan.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
The body of a leading Uigur activist,Dilbrim Samsakova, was found in June, following
her “disappearance” several weeks earlier. Her injuries indicated that she died from a blow to the head. Samsakova had been working to prevent the extradition
to China of the widow and children of a Uighur suspected of violent political
activism who was killed during a police operation in Almaty last year. She observed
the trial of four Uighurs charged with “terrorism” in Kyrgyzstan earlier this year.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
In May, the U.N. Committee against Torture considered Kazakhstan’s initial
report and expressed concern about allegations of torture by law enforcement officials,
the lack of investigation into allegations of torture, the insufficient level of
independence of the judiciary, and the overcrowding and inadequate access to
medical care in prisons and pre-trial detention centers.
In January, the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against
Women delivered concluding observations on Kazakhstan’s initial report. The
committee commended the government for the high levels of education among
women, but expressed concern over a wide range of issues, including stereotyped
attitudes towards women, the prevalence of violence against women and girls, trafficking
in women and girls, and the rise in unemployment and poverty of women.
A coalition of women’s human rights nongovernmental organizations submitted a
report to the committee, recommending that the government introduce training
programs to combat trafficking and provide trafficking victims with witness protection
and support programs.
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
In June, the OSCE chairman-in-office, Mircea Geoana, visited Kazakhstan,
meeting with President Nazarbaev and others.Although Geoana stated that human
rights must be developed along with economic, politico-military, and environmental
factors, he expressed approval at the pragmatic approach to democratization
adopted by the current Kazakh authorities. The OSCE ran a series of
roundtable discussions on electoral reform. (See above.) Training sessions were
held for local nongovernmental organizations on human rights monitoring and
the development of leadership for the promotion of women’s rights.
European Union
The European Commission made a formal protest to the Kazakh authorities following
the introduction of the new media laws in April 2001. The European Union
held the third meeting of its Cooperation Council with Kazakhstan in July, during
which it praised Kazakhstan for strong economic growth in 2000 and 2001 but
failed publicly to raise concerns about specific human rights abuses.
Council of Europe
The Political Affairs Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council
of Europe continued to consider Kazakhstan’s 1999 application for observer status.
United States
In a July 18 congressional hearing in Washington, a State Department representative
stated that although there had been economic progress in Kazakhstan, steps
towards democracy had been reversed.
The administration requested U.S. $51.5 million in assistance for Kazakhstan
for 2002, with some of the requested funds to be used for the purchase of military
equipment under the Foreign Military Financing Program.
International Financial Institutions
When the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD) visited Kazakhstan in June, he stated that the country deserved more cooperation
with the EBRD. He reportedly praised the economic reform process, and
did not raise concerns over issues of corruption or human rights which were at
odds with the EBRD’s founding charter. The EBRD expected to invest about $212
million in projects in 2001.
In February, the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors supported a new
Country Assistance Strategy for Kazakhstan for 2001-2003.Depending on progress
in reforms, the bank was to lend between $270 and $820 million over three years. If
realized, this could make Kazakhstan the largest recipient of bank funding in Central
Asia.
In its December 2000 assessment of the economy, the International Monetary
Fund recommended that the government “ensure further transparency of the oil
sector’s operations and its linkages with public finance” in order to encourage fiscal
management and “public accountability” over the government’s use of oil revenues.
It also recommended that the proposed oil stabilization fund that is meant
to maximize the benefits of oil revenues and protect the economy from an unstable
revenue stream “be based on the principles of transparency and public accountability.”
Previously, the Kazakh government had been criticized and investigated for
allegedly corrupt dealings within its oil sector.
