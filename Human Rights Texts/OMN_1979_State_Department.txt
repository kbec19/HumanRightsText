 OMAN
 Until the present Sultan seized power from his father in
 1970, Oman was considered to have had a very authoritarian
 and conservative government. Since that date, the Sultanate
 has made substantial progress in providing its citizens with
 a freer and more prosperous life. This progress took place
 despite a serious insurgency in the Dhofar Province in
 southwestern Oman during the period 1965-1976. The Dhofar
 conflict was mounted by indigenous leftists supported by
 irregular forces from the neighboring People's Democratic
 Republic of Yemen, and by the People's Republic of China and
 the Soviet Union. The Dhofar insurgency was crushed and
 declared over in 1976.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 The Omani criminal code prohibits torture, and this
 prohibition geems to be observed in practice.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 In the early 1970s, there probably were instances of cruel,
 inhuman or degrading punishment in connection with the
 Dhofar insurgency. Most cases of such behavior involved
 rebel forces rather than those of the Government. Those few
 executions announced in recent years have been of convicted
 murderers and have taken place considerably after their
 conviction.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Omani law does not specifically include habeas corpus or its
 equivalent. However, the new criminal code imposes penalties
 for unjustified arrest and detention by the authorities, and
 is regulated by statute. Citizens can petition the courts,
 the Minister of Justice, or the Sultan himself for remedies
 in cases of violations of their rights. A few abuses of the
 police power of arrest have come to the attention of the
 Department of State. There are instances of petty
 arbitrariness, usually by law enforcement officials in the
 outlying districts, who exceed their legal mandate. The
 Government of Oman has neither publicly acknowledged nor
 denied the holding of political prisoners. During the
 Dhofar war a number of insurgents and their sympathizers
 were taken prisoner. It appears that most if not all of
 these detainees have been released.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Both traditional Islamic law and criminal code call for a
 hearing and a fair trial by experienced judges. Eyewitness
 accounts revealed an impressive degree of fairness in those
 proceedings. There have been some reports of cases in which
 procedures favored the prosecution. Omani regional variations
 probably exist in this respect.

 e.   Invasion of the Home
 Warrants are not required for police searches of private
 premises. Such searches are infrequent and are resorted to
 in cases when national security is felt to be threatened (as
 in the Dhofar insurgency) or when smuggling (especially arms
 and narcotics) is suspected.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Since 1970, the Omani Government has followed liberal
 policies in providing for basic needs of the poor and in
 supporting education. Over half of the 1979 budget of $2.2
 billion reflects expenditures on social services (including
 housing, sanitation, education, development projects and
 civilian salaries). Oman's modest oil reserves and its
 heavy defense expenditures during the Dhofar insurgency have
 limited the financial resources available for social
 welfare, but increased revenues in 1979 provided a sound
 base for the government to provide basic human needs.
 Limited oil wealth has enabled the Sultan's Government to
 launch several social services and welfare programs since
 1970. However, substantial disparities of wealth still
 exist between the ruling family and the merchant class, and
 the rest of the population.
 There are persistent allegations of bribery in the awarding
 of government contracts. It is difficult to determine the
 extent to which resources are diverted from the poor. In
 the last few years, the Government has acted in one case of
 financial malfeasance by a government official.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Oman remains a traditional society in which political
 communication occurs through family, ethnic, tribal and
 regional ties, rather than through elected representative
 bodies. Freedom of the press, assembly and speech are
 circumscribed. Although the government does not practice
 prior censorship, editorials by the media, both private and
 government-owned, reflect official views. Publications from
 abroad are routinely censored and occasionally banned.
 Foreign correspondents enjoy access to government officlals
 and receive assistance from local authorities. There are no
 restrictions on religious practices for the miniscule non-
 Muslim populations.
 Oman's citizenry includes people oï¿½ diverse racial,
 linguistic, ethnic and religious backgrounds. There does
 not appear to be any officially sanctioned discrimination
 because of these differences.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Omanis may travel freely throughout the country except in a
 few parts of the Dhofar area. Through an ambitious road
 building program, including a $500 million road linking
 Northern Oman with Dhofar, the Government is promoting
 travel within the country. Omanis may freely emigrate and
 travel abroad.

 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There are neither political parties nor elections in Oman.
 Citizens have access to government leaders through personal
 appeal, which is sanctioned by Islamic and tribal practice.
 Oman remains essentially conservative in its recognition of
 political rights.
 Omani women have only recently begun to emerge from their
 traditional seclusion. However, educated Omani women do
 hold jobs, a few at very responsible levels. Women are
 becoming more active in public life, and government policy
 encourages progress in this area.
 Omani economic activity consists of the relatively small
 government bureaucracy, the country's one major oil company,
 a few small industrial ventures, and a few contracting
 companies employing transient foreign labor. Independent
 labor organizations do not exist and are officially
 discouraged.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government declined to receive a proposed Amnesty
 International mission in 1972 when the Dhofar insurgency was
 at its peak. Since then, there have been no requests by
 outside organizations.
