BELARUS
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Belarusian government policies in 2002 aimed to crush the political opposition
and served to further isolate the country internationally. The government continued
its crackdown on the opposition,nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), the
independent media, and religious groups.
The September 9, 2001 presidential elections, in which incumbent President
Alexander Lukashenka was the victor, received widespread criticism and briefly
made the poor human rights situation in Belarus a focal point of international concern.
But when the events of September 11 and their aftermath again pushed
Belarus far from the international spotlight, Lukashenka did not miss the opportunity
to repress civil society without fear of diplomatic consequences.
Throughout the year, Lukashenka sought retribution against those who challenged
him during the election, and their supporters. Vladimir Goncharik, the united opposition candidate in the presidential elections, had to leave his post as
leader of the Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) in December 2001 after it received
credible reports that Lukashenka would sign a decree nationalizing the FTU’s property
unless Goncharik resigned.Goncharik subsequently moved to Russia.His election
campaign manager,Valentina Polevikova, was also forced to leave her job at the
FTU.Members of the Belarusian Women’s Party,which she chairs, received threats
that they would be fired unless they left the party.
One of Lukashenka’s major opponents, former Prime Minister Mikhail Chigir,
was sentenced in July 2002 to three years in prison for tax evasion, with the execution
of the sentence postponed for two years. In 2001, the government had prevented
Chigir from running for president by launching politically motivated
charges of abuse of office and imprisoning him.
Anatoly Lebedko, chair of the opposition United Civic Party (UCP), was
charged in July with “defaming the Belarusian President”after he published an article
citing foreign media reports that the president supplies “rogue” states with military
equipment. His party also received an official warning, which put the UCP
under threat of liquidation.
Harassment of youth opposition activists continued throughout the year. Two
Youth Front leaders were respectively fined and briefly imprisoned for their role in
organizing an unsanctioned demonstration in February. In March, members of
another youth opposition movement, Zubr, were fined for “publicly insulting the
president,” for their street performance satirizing Lukashenka prior to the 2001
elections.
After a series of tax raids and confiscation of equipment and publications that
accompanied the election campaign in 2001,Belarusian authorities moved to a new
level of intimidation of the media by launching criminal libel suits against journalists.
On June 24, a court sentenced Pavel Mazheiko, a journalist for the independent
weekly Pahonia (The Emblem), and the weekly’s editor,Mikola Markevich, to
two and two and a half years of forced labor respectively for libeling Lukashenka;
the sentences were reduced to one year on appeal. On the eve of the 2001 elections,
Pahonia had published an article suggesting Lukashenka’s involvement in the “disappearances”
of political leaders.After confiscating the entire print run of the issue
and giving an official warning, the authorities shut down Pahonia in November
2001.
On September 16, Victor Ivashkevich, editor of Rabochii (The Worker) was
found guilty of “attempted libel and insulting the president” and sentenced to two
years of forced labor. The charges stemmed from an article accusing Lukashenka
and his administration of corruption.
The authorities also aggressively pursued civil defamation suits against newspapers
that allegedly insulted state officials, freezing the publications’ accounts,
searching their headquarters repeatedly, and compelling them to pay prohibitive
damages. Among the targets was Nasha Svaboda (Our Freedom), which a court
ordered to pay U.S.$55,000 in libel damages to a state official.The paper also had to
retract the offending article, which alleged that the official had complained to
Lukashenka about the prosecutor general’s professional conduct. The authorities
confiscated the newspaper’s equipment; with its bank account frozen, the paper
was not able to publish after August 6.
With the media under fire, public demonstrations remained the sole means for
public critical expression. Authorities either banned protests or authorized them
only in remote locations, and responded to unauthorized demonstrations with
arrests and prosecutions.
On March 15,Ministry of Internal Affairs troops dispersed a march held to mark
the eighth anniversary of the 1994 constitution of independent Belarus. March
organizer Nikolai Statkevich, leader of the Social Democratic Party Narodnaya
Hramada, was later sentenced to ten days of imprisonment.
Also in March, more than eighty people were arrested and given brief prison
terms, fines, or official warnings after police broke up a Freedom Day rally.Another
hundred people were arrested and about forty injured in clashes with police in
April during an unauthorized protest against living conditions in Belarus. Protest
organizers and participants were sentenced to up to fifteen days in jail; others were
fined.
In line with its effort to control all spheres of social life, Belarusian authorities
sought to restrict religious freedom. In October, Parliament adopted a new law on
religion that, if signed by the president, would ban organized religious activity by
communities of fewer than twenty members, and would practically outlaw religious
confessions that have had representation in Belarus for fewer than twenty
years. It would also introduce censorship for religious literature under certain circumstances
and require the leaders of all religious organizations to be citizens of
Belarus.
Meanwhile, authorities continued to persecute non-Orthodox religious groups.
In August, demolition crews backed up by police destroyed a new building of the
Belarusian Autocephalous Orthodox Church in a small village in Grodno province.
Police violently dispersed parish members and their supporters who tried to prevent
the demolition; many were arrested and sentenced to brief jail terms and fines.
Members of Hare Krishna and Hindu communities were regularly detained and
fined for meditating in public places, chanting religious hymns in the streets, or
protesting repeated refusals to register their community.
The 1999 and 2000 “disappearances” of opposition figures Yury Zakharenka,
Viktor Gonchar, Anatoly Krasovsky and journalist Dmitri Zavadsky remained
unresolved. In March, a court found two former officers of the “Almaz” special
police unit guilty of abducting Dmitri Zavadsky, but the verdict did not satisfy his
family, whose lawyers saw the officers as mere scapegoats for higher-level authorities
involved in the “disappearance.” For stating this view publicly, one of the
lawyers, Igor Aksenchik, lost his license to practice, was charged with slander, and,
in October 2002 was sentenced to eighteen months in prison,with the execution of
the sentence postponed for two years.
Belarusian authorities also banned the broadcast of a new documentary on
Zavadsky’s and other “disappearances” entitled “Wild Manhunt-2,” shot by Zavadsky’s
friend and colleague Pavel Sheremet.
In November 2002, parliament declined the request of the Belarusian Helsinki
Committee to carry out parliamentary investigation into the disappearances.
For the second year in a row,Belarus received the lowest rating possible from the
U.S. State Department for failing to combat trafficking in persons.The report noted
that Belarus was a country of origin and transit for women and children trafficked abroad, but that the government failed to prosecute traffickers or train law
enforcement officials to recognize trafficking. Corruption also hindered attempts
to implement anti-trafficking provisions in the criminal code.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
The authorities continued to widely use Presidential Decree No.8 (adopted in
March 2001) to obstruct the work of human rights organizations. The decree bans
foreign aid to organizations involved in any political activities, and requires governmental
approval for the use of any foreign funding; security service and tax
authorities cited these provisions in measures they took against NGOs.
On January 25, a court fined Victor Kornienko, head of a local branch of Civic
Initiatives, a human rights NGO, about U.S.$625 for alleged violation of the decree
and ordered confiscation of the organization’s computer equipment. In November
2001, a regional tax committee had fined it $3,750.
Civic Initiatives may well share the fate of Vezha, a prominent human rights
organization liquidated in March by a court order. Vezha had previously received
two official warnings, which constitutes sufficient grounds for liquidation according
to Belarusian law.
In addition to closing existing organizations, the government prevented the
founding of new ones, making use of excessively burdensome registration regulations.
Referring to “certain inaccuracies” in registration documents, authorities
denied registration to “Association XXI,” as well as other NGOs.
Activists with Viasna, another prominent human rights NGO, were repeatedly
harassed throughout the year, and denied access to court hearings and detention
facilities. One of them, Vladimir Malei, was sentenced to fifteen days of imprisonment
in January for holding a protest commemorating the anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights the previous month.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
In May, the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child examined Belarus’s second
periodic report. The committee recommended the Belarusian government to
address the problem of increased child morbidity and HIV/AIDS among newborns;
to combat violence against children; eliminate child trafficking and sexual
exploitation; and to ensure that all children have access to health care, education,
and other rights specified in the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
The same month, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights publicly
expressed concern about the deterioration of the human rights situation in Belarus.
The U.N.’s annual Human Development Report, released in July, listed Belarus
among those countries where free and fair elections are not being held and citizens
are disaffected from politics.
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
Relations between the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) and Minsk further deteriorated. Belarusian authorities, long dissatisfied
with the OSCE’s efforts to publicize the human rights situation in the country,
repeatedly accused members of the OSCE Advisory and Monitoring Group (AMG)
of interfering with the country’s internal affairs and called for a revision of the
AMG mandate. Since December 2001, the government refused to extend visas for
four AMG diplomats, thereby forcing them to leave the country.The AMG mission
was effectively shut down in October 2002, after the authorities refused to extend
the last remaining member’s diplomatic accreditation, thereby compelling her also
to leave the country. Negotiations on the further relations between the OSCE and
Belarus were entered into immediately but had borne no results as of this writing.
The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly refused to restore Belarus’s special guest status
until the country normalized its relations with the OSCE.
Council of Europe
A Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) delegation that visited
Belarus in June expressed concern about the continuous attacks on freedom of
speech and denounced the prosecution of the Pahonia journalists.
Noting that the conflict with the OSCE had a corrosive effect on Belarus’s relations
with other international institutions, the PACE announced that it would not
restore the country’s special guest status until its relationship with the OSCE was
normalized.The PACE Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights also decided
to establish an ad hoc sub-committee to examine political “disappearances” in
Belarus.
A resolution adopted during the PACE’s September session expressed “growing
concern regarding freedom of expression and of the media,” terming recent convictions
of journalists “unacceptable,” and concluded that special guest status, let
alone full membership for the country, could not be considered.
European Union
The E.U. criticized the Belarusian leadership for obstructing the work of the
OSCE AMG. In August, the E.U. also urged the Belarusian Parliament not to adopt
the draft law on religion, noting that it may serve as a basis for religious discrimination.
A September declaration by the presidency urged the Belarusian authorities
to engage in “constructive negotiations with the OSCE on the future of the AMG in
Belarus,” and expressed overall concern about the “situation of democracy and
human rights in Belarus.”
International Financial Institutions
In April, the World Bank approved a three-year Country Assistance Strategy that
envisions U.S.$140 million in loans to Belarus. The Bank may expand lending to $270 million if economic reform is implemented.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development took a more critical
stand, and in May approved a two-year country strategy that made clear that its
involvement would remain limited to the private sector until the Belarusian
authorities take steps to promote civil society and carry out market reforms.
United States
In a number of public statements, U.S. officials condemned Belarus’s role in its
conflict with the OSCE, as well as the government’s harassment of journalists and
its restraints on freedom of expression. In numerous statements, U.S. officials also
made clear that the bilateral relationship with Belarus would not move from the
current standstill unless the country demonstrates its commitment to universal
principles of democracy and human rights.
U.S. officials repeatedly expressed concern about reports that the Lukashenka
government sold weapons and provided military training to Iraq and other states
suspected of supporting terrorism.
In June,Christopher H. Smith, co-chairman of the Commission on Security and
Cooperation in Europe, introduced the Belarus Democracy Act of 2002 in the
House of Representatives. The bill proposes increased assistance for democracybuilding
activities in Belarus, suggests sanctions against the Lukashenka government,
including the denial of entry into the U.S. to high-ranking officials, and
encourages executive directors of international financial institutions to vote against
financial assistance to Belarus.
Russian Federation
Since Russia and Belarus signed a union treaty seven years ago, President
Lukashenka’s government has relied heavily on Russia’s support both to keep the
Belarusian economy afloat and to rebut criticism from the West.
In 2002, however, Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed skepticism about
the future of the union and made clear that Russia would not sacrifice its economic
interests to support Belarus. Instead, Putin advanced two proposals for unification—
one that would effectively absorb Belarus into Russia, subjecting it to Russian
economic policies and possibly removing Lukashenka from office, and the
other suggesting a suprastate formation similar to the E.U.; Lukashenka rejected
both proposals.
