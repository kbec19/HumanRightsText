 SWEDEN
 Fundamental political freedoms and human rights of Swedish
 citizens are guaranteed by the constitution and the government
 enforces these guarantees. Sweden occupies a prominent
 position in international efforts to enhance human rights. In
 the United Nations, it has been active in support of
 initiatives against torture, campaigned for measures to ensure
 religious tolerance and proposed the outlawing of capital
 punishment. Sweden has ratified the two international human
 rights covenants and the optional Protocol to the Covenant on
 Civil and Political Rights, and is a party to the European
 Convention on Human Rights.
 The government and a cross section of Swedes from right to left
 consider the protection of human rights a cornerstone of
 Swedish society. Swedish ombudsmen, appointed by parliament
 and with full autonomy, are charged with the investigation of
 complaints of private persons that their rights have been
 violated.
 I. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom
 from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice (chapter 2, article 3 of the "Instrument of
 Government").
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 Sweden has a progressive prison system. Periodic home visits
 for prisoners are a special feature of the system.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no reports of abduction, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detention in Sweden.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Guarantees with respect to the integrity of the person are
 rigorously enforced. However, habeas corpus does not exist.
 Individuals disturbing the public order or thought to pose a
 danger to others or themselves may be held for six hours for
 questioning, and for a maximum of another six hours if
 necessary. Criminal suspects may be held temporarily under the
 same procedure, but they cannot be detained longer than twelve
 hours without charges being filed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Swedish constitution forbids deprivation of liberty without
 public trial by a court of law. Every citizen has the right to
 effective counsel. The judiciary functions freely and
 independently of the executive. There are no military courts
 in Sweden in peacetime.

 f. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from arbitrary invasion of the home is guaranteed by
 law and enforced in practice. Searches are limited under law
 to cases in which the suspect is believed to have committed a
 crime punishable by at least two years' imprisonment.
 wiretapping is limited to cases involving narcotics or national
 security. With certain exceptions (when the time factor is
 crucial), searches and wiretaps require court approval.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Swedes enjoy the full exercise of these freedoms. There is a
 national church supported by public funds, but this in no way
 restricts religious freedom.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement within and from the country, as
 well as a right of voluntary repatriation. Sweden maintains
 quotas for admission of refugees, a status which entails
 numerous benefits, but political asylum is granted without
 respect to quotas. There has been a small net immigration in
 recent years.
 Net immigration to Sweden consists of roughly equal numbers of
 Nordic and non-Nordic citizens. A majority of the latter are
 family reunion cases. Refugees and asylum seekers have come
 largely from Latin America, but also from Eastern Europe,
 Vietnam and other countries. The total numbers admitted over
 the past three years have ranged from just under 3,000 in 1979
 to over 4,500 in 1980, a credible record for a host country of
 slightly over 8 million inhabitants.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Sweden has a long history of orderly, democratic political
 life. There is universal suffrage over age 18, and although
 voting is not compulsory, participatiQn in national elections
 is usually around 90 percent of the eligible electorate. All
 aliens who have been registered residents of Sweden for at
 least three years have the right to vote and to run for office
 in municipal and county council elections. Labor is free to
 organize, and workers have the right to strike. The large
 majority of the Swedish working population belongs to a trade
 union. This includes career military personnel and civilian
 government officials. Although the country's largest trade
 union association and largest political party are closely
 associated, the activities of that union and of others are
 directed by the unions themselves. Women enjoy legal equality
 in Sweden, and participate fully in the economic, political and
 social life of Sweden.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International and
 Hon-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human
 Rights.
 There are no known requests for independent, outside
 investigations of alleged human rights violations in Sweden.
 With regard to pertinent third countries, Sweden supports the

 872
 principle of independent outside investigations. Swedish
 government agencies are in close contact with Amnesty
 International, the International Committee of theRed Cross,
 church organizations, and a variety of other private and public
 groups working in Sweden and abroad for the defense of human
 rights. Sweden plays a leading role in international human
 rights bodies.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Sweden enjoys one of the world's highest standards of living,
 with an estimated per capita GNP of US $11,930 in 1979. Life
 expectancy at birth is approximately 76 years, and the infant
 mortality rate is 8 per 1,000 live births. Virtually 100
 percent of the population is literate, and the adjusted primary
 school enrollment ratio for both males and females is 99
 percent . The population growth rate averaged 0.3 percent
 during the 1970's, and the ratio of calorie supply available
 for consumption relative to nutritional requirements is 120
 percent.
 Sweden has been a world leader in policies to meet such basic
 needs as food, shelter, health care and education. Social
 welfare legislation provides foVy:ealth and medical services,
 welfare services, various family benefits, pensions, and
 disability and unemployment insurance. Per capita gross
 national product attempts to redistribute the wealth evenly
 among all segments of the population. Unemployment remains
 about two percent, although youth unemployment figures are
 higher--around 5 percent in 1979. A conscious effort continues
 to extend equality between the sexes to the fullest. There is
 a government ombudsman for equal employment opportunity, legal
 protection of the right to equal pay for equal work, and a
 conscious effort to break down patterns which associate men and
 women exclusively with specific jobs.
 Around 422,000 foreign nationals live in Sweden as legal
 immigrants, of whom around 234,000 are employed. They enjoy
 welfare benefits and legal protection essentially equal to
 those enjoyed by Swedish citizens. The Swedish government has
 established special programs designed to help the immigrant
 workers adjust to Swedish life and culture, and has cooperated
 with the press to generate publicity aimed at gaining greater
 acceptance of immigrant workers among the Swedish public at
 large. Allegations of discrimination against immigrants did
 occur during 1981. These charges have centered on such matters
 as denial of housing or of accommodations in restaurants and
 hotels, rather than on employment or fundamental economic and
 political rights. There are effective legal procedures to
 counter discrimination and the Government of Sweden is
 investigating complaints of discrimination.
