NICARAGUA
This is a detailed and informative Report which gives full credence to the reports by a domestic group that effectively documents abuses in Nicaragua -- the Permanent Commission on Human Rights (CPDH). Though respect for the work of a responsible organization is welcome, it contrasts with the effort in the Report on El Salvador to ignore, discount and discredit the reports by the comparably responsible group in that country, Tutela Legal â€” the human rights monitoring office of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese.
The Report on Nicaragua contains a serious mistake in reporting the findings of CPDH. It says that "[t]he Permanent Commission on Human Rights documented 167 unresolved cases of disappearance in which it said security forces were implicated." Actually, the Annual Report of CPDH for 1983 lists 31 unresolved cases of disappearances.*
We assume that this mistake reflects carelessness rather than intentional misrepresentation. What may have happened is that Embassy or State Department off icials tabulated the disappearances reported periodically by CPDH but neglected to check back with the organization to determine how many cases were resolved. It is important in Nicaragua to inquire
* As of February 13, 1984, when two representatives of Americas Watch visited the offices of CPDH in Managua, the organization said that three of those persons had been located, bringing the unresolved cases for 1983 to 28.

about the resolution of disappearance cases because, as the Americas Watch has pointed out in several reports, persons are arrested in rural areas without any system for notifying families. It often takes weeks or months until such persons are located. In the majority of cases, however, they eventually turn up alive.
In some sections, this Report goes out of its way to find bad things to say about the government of Nicaragua. For example, in a section purporting to show anti-Semitism it asserts: "According to a report from a member of the Jewish community in Nicaragua, five Sandinista guerrillas attempted to set fire to the main door of the Managuan synagogue in 1978." Though we do not know whether this incident actually took place, assuming that it did it seems peculiar to find it in a report on human rights in 1983. Certainly the Report on El Salvador is silent on what has been said about the role of Roberto d'Aubuisson, President of the Salvadoran Constituent Assembly in 1983, in the murder of Archbishop Romero in 1980. Why go back five years only in the case of Nicaragua to hold it responsible for abuses before it came to power? Why not also do this in the case of other governments? Were it appropriate to cite this allegation in the Nicaragua Report, it would seem imperative to also acknowledge that the U.S. Ambassador to Nicaragua sent a cable to Secretary of State Shultz on July 16, 1983, which concluded:

"We have found no verifiable ground on which to accuse the [Nicaraguan government] of anti-Semitism."
This section of the Report on Nicaragua also contains the assertion that " It]he Sandinista Front had close ties with the Palestine Liberation Organization before its rise to power, and the new Government continued those relations, and adopted a strong anti-Israel and anti-Zionist position." This is accurate, but if it is relevant in the case of Nicaragua, why not point out in the Reports on Pakistan and Saudi Arabia that those governments have close ties with the PLO and are strongly anti-Israel and anti-Zionist?
Including information that reflects badly on Nicaragua when analogous information is omitted from Reports on other countries mars what might otherwise be a creditable Report.
