 TAIWAN
 The human rights situation in Taiwan remains uneven. More
 than thirty years of impressive economic development has
 raised the standard of living, improved social welfare, and
 expanded the opportunities for individual economic partici-
 pation. However, Taiwan remains an essentially one-party
 system. Although the right of individuals to run for elec-
 tive office is recognized, coordinated opposition activity
 is generally prohibited. The publication of opposition
 political views is closely controlled and the activities of
 outspoken oppositionists are monitored, both at home and,
 apparently, abroad. Martial law has been in effect since
 1949, justified on the basis of the continued perceived
 threat of military action and subversion from mainland
 China.
 Taiwan's human rights climate in 1981 was clouded by the
 mysterious death of a Taiwan-born U.S. resident, Chen
 Wen-cheng (Wen-chen Chen), a professor at Carnegie-Mellon
 University in Pittsburgh. On July 3, 1981, Professor Chen's
 body was found sprawled at the foot of a fire-escape on the
 campus of Taiwan University shortly after a 12-hour interro-
 gation by security police concerning alleged Taiwan indepen-
 dence activities in the United States. Both the Taipei
 authorities and independent American investigators concluded
 that Chen died of injuries sustained in a fall from the
 building. The Taipei authorities found no evidence of
 murder. However, American observers invited later by the
 authorities concluded that Chen probably was murdered.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person; Including
 Preedom from:
 a. Torture
 Taiwan law specifically prohibits the use of torture.
 Article 98 of the code of criminal procedure states that
 an accused shall be frankly examined, but that no vio-
 lence, threat, inducement, fraud or other improper means
 shall be used. This same language is repeated in article
 109 of the military trial law. The authorities declared in
 July 1980 that while some detainees may have been subjected
 to torture in the past, torture has not been used in any
 case in the past ten years.
 Prior to the Kaohsiung Incident,* allegations of torture had
 been extremely rare. During the 1980 Kaohsiung Incident
 *On December 10, 1979, a "human rights rally" in Kaohsiung
 resulted in violence. Referred to as the Kaohsiung Riot,
 or Kaohsiung Incident, this disturbance led to the arrest
 and conviction (by military courts) on charges of sedition
 of several important oppositionist leaders, who received
 prison sentences ranging from 12 years to life. Other rally
 organizers were charged with lesser crimes, and 29 were
 convicted.
 
 (576)
 
 
 577
 trials, however, there was a considerable amount of testimony
 from the defendants that they were subjected to one or more
 forms of mistreatment during interrogation at detention
 centers or police stations, including denial of sleep, being
 forced to stand for long periods of time, threats of physical
 abuse, solitary confinement and being forced to eat salted
 rice, which caused severe bloating and constipation. A few
 defendants testified that they were beaten by their inter-
 rogators.
 The courts rejected the defendants' allegations, but no
 evidence was produced before the court that an investi-
 gation of the allegations had been conducted.
 In 1981 the issue of torture was raised in connection
 with the death of Professor Chen Wen-cheng. However,
 the authorities allowed an American forensic pathologist
 to examine the body. Although he disputed the authorities'
 suggestion that suicide or accidental death was indicated,
 he found no evidence of torture.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Although imprisonment .is the usual form of punishment for
 both political and nonpolitical offenders, the death
 penalty is occasionally imposed and executions are carried
 out by firing squard.
 Prison conditions reportedly have improved in recent years.
 In general, prisoners are reported to receive adequate
 nourishment and can accept money from relatives to purchase
 extra food. An Amnesty International report on Taiwan ob-
 served that at some prisons medical treatment is substandard,
 but that prisoners are permitted a daily exercise period. A
 Taiwan magazine sympathetic to the Kaohsiung Incident defen-
 dants reported in April 1981 improvements in the living
 conditions of six of the eight convicted of sedition,
 noting that they had been allowed daily exercise, though
 they were not then permitted to talk with one another. They
 were also permitted to work and go to the library one day
 each week. Another magazine also reported in June 1981 that
 conditions for 20 other Kaohsiung Incident prisoners held in
 solitary confinement have improved since the beginning of
 1981.
 There are reports that some prisoners with medical problems
 have not received adequate treatment, and a few are alleged
 to be suffering still from pretrial mistreatment. Most
 prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment for sedition,
 including one Kaohsiung Incident defendant, are held at the
 remote prison facility on Green Island where conditions are
 reported to be harsher, medical care substandard, and only
 limited family visitation is permitted.
 There is no discrimination in the treatment of prisoners
 because of class, race, sex or religion.
 c. Disappearances
 In recent years, there have been no credible reports of
 persons being abducted or secretly arrested by the security
 services.
 
 
 578
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Taiwan's law of habeas corpus (article 8 of the con-
 stitution) requires that, following an individual's
 arrest, the arresting authorities notify in writing the
 individual and his designated relative or friend of the
 reason for his arrest or detention. Notification must be
 given within 24 hours after the arrest takes place.
 Article 108 of the code of criminal procedure specifies
 that the authorities may not detain an accused for more
 than two months during investigation prior to the filing
 of the formal indictment, or three months during trial.
 During the investigation phase, however, the prosecuting
 officer may apply to the court for one extension of two
 months. The period of detention may also be extended
 during the time the accused is on trial. In recent cases,
 including the Kaohsiung Incident, the authorities generally
 have followed the requirements of the above provisions, with
 exceptions occurring more frequently in the military system.
 The Taiwan authorities deny conducting arbitrary arrests
 and holding political prisoners. They have stated that at
 the end of 1975 there were 254 persons in prison on sedition
 charges. Some persons have been released and others arrest-
 ed since that time, but this is the moat recent figure made
 public by the authorities. An Amnesty International
 memorandum states that prison officials at Green Island re-
 ported that 115 prisoners convicted of sedition and related
 offenses were being held at that facility in February 1980,
 including 20 who had been there since the early 1950s.
 Many minor crimes in Taiwan have been handled under a
 statute which empowers the police not only to arrest,
 but also to prosecute and punish offenders. This law
 sometimes has been used against political activists.
 In 1980 Taiwan's central police administration completed
 a draft law on social peace which would transfer autho-
 rity to try such cases from the police to a newly esta-
 blished court. Since some of the penalties available
 to the police were severe, and there was no recognized
 appeal procedure, the new system appears designed to
 limit abuses of police power. The Executive Yuan
 announced in September 1981 that the new law would be
 submitted to the Legislative Yuan for ratification in
 1982.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Taiwan reorganized its judiciary in 1980, with the district
 and high courts shifted from the Executive Yuan's control to
 that of the Judicial Yuan. The change was aimed at formally
 separating the courts from the prosecution function, both of
 which previously fell under the ministry of legal affairs.
 It is generally held in Taiwan legal circles that the change
 has given the judiciary greater independence of action.
 Since the judicial reorganization, the Taiwan high court
 has reversed or reduced lower court rulings in several cases
 with political overtones. The court overturned two convic-
 tions and reduced the sentences of 22 others convicted in
 the 1980 Kaohsiung Incident trials. More recently it re-
 duced the sentences of two politicians, not members of the
 ruling Kuomintang (Nationalist Party or KMT), who were
 convicted of campaign irregularities in the December 1980
 
 
 579
 elections, upheld the sentences of two others, and increased
 the sentence of one defendant who is a KMT member.
 Under martial law, civilians who commit certain offenses,
 including sedition, may be tried in military court. Opposi-
 tion to basic policy (such as expressing views contrary to
 the authorities' claim to represent all China, or support-
 ing an independent legal status for Taiwan) is considered
 seditious and thus punishable under martial law.
 The authorities occasionally transfer "important" civilian
 cases (those involving such crimes as homicide, illegal
 possession of weapons and robbery) to the military courts.
 The authorities state that the military courts' swifter and
 generally more severe justice acts as a deterrent to poten-
 tial criminals.
 Neither civil nor martial law provides the defendant
 with protection from self-incrimination. He can be
 interrogated at length. The defendant may be detained
 during the investigation phase and has no right to
 legal representation prior to the filing of an indict-
 ment. However, the ministry of legal affairs announced
 in September 1981 that revision of the code of criminal
 procedure is currently under discussion and that the
 right to counsel during the investigation is one of the
 main points being discussed.
 Another recent (1981) court martial of note was the case
 of Ms. Yeh Tao-lei, a junior college teacher who was con-
 victed of sedition and sentenced to 14 years imprisonment
 after a closed, half-day trial in a military court. Yeh
 was accused of having been subverted by communists while
 in the United States, of espionage, and of spreading com-
 munist propaganda in Taiwan after her return in 1978.
 The military tribunal reportedly held that Yeh had propa-
 gandized for the communists on her return to Taiwan, and
 had collected information on Taiwan's political situation
 for communist agents in the U.S. and Hong Kong. During her
 trial Yeh explained her actions, stating that she had no
 seditious intent, that the political material she sent to
 overseas contacts was in the public domain, and that she was
 not trained by the communists.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Physical invasion of the home without warrant is not a common
 practice in Taiwan. Article 128 of the code of criminal
 procedure requires that searches be authorized by warrants,
 signed by a procurator during the investigation of a crime,
 and by a judge during trial. The procedure is normally,
 though not always, followed. Allegations of other types of
 violations of the home, such as monitoring phone calls,
 have not been verified but are widely believed to exist.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Article 11 of the constitution guarantees freedom of speech
 and the press. These rights are limited, however, by the
 en forcement of martial law provisions. Individuals are
 not free publicly to question the regime's basic political
 
 
 580
 policy of anti-communism and claim to sovereignty over all
 of Chins. Persons who speak favorably of communism or the
 People's Republic of China, or persons (usually native
 Taiwanese) who question the legitimacy of Taiwan's main-
 lander authorities by expressing Taiwan independence or
 self-determination sympathies can expect to be charged with
 sedition and to be tried in a military court.
 Information brought to light during the investigation of the
 death of Professor Chen Wen-cheng suggests that the security
 authorities closely monitor political expression, both at
 home and overseas. The authorities were reported to have
 disclosed that during the police interrogation of Chen immedi-
 ately prior to his death, they confronted him with detailed
 evidence of his alleged political activities in the United
 States. The evidence reportedly included a tape recording of
 what was purported to be an international telephone call
 between Professor Chen in the United States and Kaohsiung
 Incident defendant Shih Ming-teh in Taiwan, and a recording
 of a speech which Chen had made in Pittsburgh supporting
 the Kaohsiung Incident defendants. (Officials later stated
 that there was no recording of a Pittsburgh speech.)
 These reports sparked a resurgence of allegations that Taiwan
 agents are carrying out a systematic program of surveillance
 and intimidation of Taiwanese students on American university
 campuses who are suspected of having Taiwan independence or
 self-determination sympathies. Indeed, Taiwan newspaper arti-
 cles have noted the role of Taiwan security service units in
 the United States and Japan in monitoring dissident Taiwan
 political activitists. Returnees from overseas are sometimes
 questioned by the authorities about their activities abroad.
 Censorship of publications occurs frequently and is carried
 out through provisions of the publications law which empowers
 the security services to seize or ban printed material that
 "confuses public opinion and affects the morale of the public
 and the armed forces.* While the authorities continue
 to allow some domestic political opinion magazines, in 1981
 they banned one or more issues of several-such magazines.
 Nominally the bans are in reaction to articles critical of
 the policies of the authorities or which discuss sensitive
 subjects, but they are widely viewed as tactics of intimida-
 tion. The limits of acceptable political criticism are not
 clear-cut and even periodicals which are cautious in their
 selection of articles for publication have been banned from
 time to time. The ban of a single issue of a magazine may
 be followed by suspension of the publication's license for
 one year.
 In July 1981 the Taiwan press reported that official sanc-
 tions had been taken against 453 publications for various
 infractions during the preceding year. During 1981 a number
 of politically oriented periodicals were suspended for up
 to a year by the authorities, among them "New Generation',
 *Deep Plough", "Progressive*, "Great Epoch', 'Horizontal and
 Vertical" and "New Horizons". Other magazines suspended in
 1980, however, reappeared in 1981 ("The Eighties", "Current",
 "The Asian", and "Bell Drum Tower"). Politically, the
 coloration of most of the suspended periodicals has been
 moderate although at least one publication of the extreme
 right was also banned.
 
 
 581
 Foreign publications are also subject to censorship. Issues
 of "Time", "Newsweek", and the "Far Eastern Economic Review"
 sometimes have pages carrying articles offensive to the
 authorities removed before they are distributed. Occasional-
 ly a complete issue will be banned without explanation.
 Issues of the "International Herald Tribune" have had arti-
 cles blacked out and some issues have not been delivered
 at all. In September 1981, the Government Information
 Office suspended the credentials of one foreign wire service
 reporter who declined to retract wording in a politically
 sensitive story. (She had described the examination of
 Chen Wen-cheng's body by the American pathologist as an
 "autopsy", instead of using the approved version that
 he had merely "viewed the body." See Section l.a above.)
 Freedom to practice religion is guaranteed by article 13
 of the constitution. Most Taiwan inhabitants adhere to
 Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, animism, or a combination
 of beliefs. Other religions include Christianity and
 Islam. Some pseudo-Buddhist sects and Sun Myong Moon's
 Christian Unification church have been banned.
 While generally respecting the right to practice religion,
 the authorities have brought pressure to bear against re-
 ligious organizations whose activities the authorities
 view as an unacceptable involvement in politics. For
 example, in 1977 the Taiwan Presbyterian church (179,000
 members) issued a "Declaration of Human Rights", to which
 the church leadership has since repeatedly reaffirmed its
 commitment. By calling for the creation of a "new and
 independent Taiwan," the declaration has placed Taiwan's
 Presbyterian leaders (almost all native Taiwanese) in a
 position of questioning the legitimacy of Taiwan's main-
 lander-controlled political institutions. The resulting
 friction between the church and the authorities came to a
 head in 1980 when the church's secretary-general, Reverend
 Kao Chun-ming, and several other Presbyterians were convict-
 ed in military court of harboring sedition defendant Shih
 Ming-teh. While admitting he had assisted Shih, Rev. Kao
 denied seditious intent; he declared his religious vocation
 precluded his betraying someone who had sought help and
 permitted him only to advise Shih to give himself up.
 In February 1981, the ruling Kuomintang Party indicated
 its intention to seek legislation regulating church
 activities. A similar proposal in 1979 was strongly opposed
 by the Presbyterians, Catholics, and other religious groups
 who argued that such a law would infringe upon freedom of
 religion. However, the Kuomintang argues that the law is
 necessary to "define the scope of religion" and to "protect
 freedom of religion." Additionally, the Kuomintang has
 proposed an amendment of the education statutes which would
 bring more than 60 religious educational institutions, not
 currently recognized by the ministry of education under the
 Ministry's jurisdiction. While the Kuomintang argues that
 this would improve the quality of instruction and provide
 accreditation for the diplomas granted by these schools,
 critics point out that it would also empower the ministry
 of education to control curricula and to place a military
 training officer in each school.
 Freedom of assembly is guaranteed by article 14 of
 the constitution. While assembly for nonpolitical purposes
 generally has not been a problem, assembly for political
 purposes, except during elections, has often been limited
 or prevented. In October 1981 two separate meetings orga-
 
 
 582
 nized by oppositionist legislator Kang Ning-hsiang drew
 thousands of participants. However, both were dispersed by
 police an hour after they had begun.
 Supplementary elections for the national assembly and
 the Legislative Yuan were held December 6, 1980. During
 the 15-day campaign period preceding the balloting all
 candidates, including oppositionists, were able to hold
 rallies. Those rallies, however, were closely regulated
 by the authorities under the Election and Recall Law
 passed in 1980. A similar period for holding rallies
 preceded the November 14, 1981 election of county, city
 and provincial officials.
 There is no tradition of trade unionism in Taiwan, and
 labor unions do not exercise significant influence
 either in the economic or political sphere. While
 labor unions are permitted to organize, walkouts and
 strikes are prohibited under martial law. Collective
 bargaining, although provided for by legislation, does
 not exist.
 b. Freedom of Movement within Taiwan, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The constitution provides for the freedom to change re-
 sidence. There is general freedom of internal travel in
 Taiwan, except to military areas and to sparsely populated
 mountainous areas. Travel abroad and emigration have
 become gradually freer, except to mainland China and some
 communist countries. Males over age 13 usually may not
 leave Taiwan until completion of their military service.
 Since 1980, businessmen have been permitted to travel to
 and do business directly with certain eastern European
 countries.
 Permission to leave Taiwan may be delayed or withheld in
 some cases for security reasons or because the persons
 involved have criticized the political establishment.
 Then Interior Minister Chiu Chuang-huan told the Legis-
 lative Yuan on October 28, 1981 that 949,306 persons had
 applied for exit permission in 1980. Of that number, Chiu
 said that over 20,000 were refused, 327 for security
 reasons and the rest for unspecified causes.
 In general, the authorities recognize the right of re-
 patriation of Chinese holding Taiwan passports who reside
 in Taiwan. Those issued -overseas Chinese' passports
 do not automatically have the right to travel to Taiwan
 for permanent residence. In principle, Taiwan will not
 authorize the entry of Chinese, even those who have long
 held Taiwan passports, if they have lived in communist-
 controlled areas within the preceding five years.
 Taiwan has developed a program of assistance to Indo-
 chinese refugees. Through August 1981, Taiwan has granted
 permanent resettlement to more than 12,600 such refugees,
 nearly all of them ethnic Chinese. Taiwan has also pledged
 to provide temporary resettlement to all 'boat people"
 rescued on the high seas by Taiwan vessels. The authorities
 have provided nearly 70,000 metric tons of rice, valued at
 $23 million, to Southeast Asian countries with large refugee
 populations, and has donated $800,000 to the International
 Rescue Committee for use in its refugee program.
 
 
 583
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Reflecting the claim of the Taiwan authorities to be the
 government of all of China, there is an array of central
 political bodies over and above those which pertain solely
 to the island of Taiwan. The locus of power on Taiwan is
 the presidency and the central executive branch, which
 are not subject to popular election. While representation
 of native Taiwanese (descendants of Chinese who migrated
 from the mainland a century or more ago and now constitute
 about 85 percent of the population) in local and central
 legislative bodies has been increasing, Taiwanese are
 underrepresented in the powerful executive branch, in
 which persons from the mainland provinces hold the most
 powerful positions. There have been recent increases
 in the number of Taiwanese holding executive branch
 positions, however. The vice president, about one-third
 of the cabinet (including the vice premier, the minister
 of the interior, the minister of communications, and
 three ministers without portfolio) and the governor of
 Taiwan, among others, are Taiwanese. Critics point out,
 however, that their power and influence both individually
 and collectively are limited.
 The most important elective bodies at the central level
 are the national assembly, which elects the president
 and vice president, and the Legislative Yuan, which is
 the central legislature. There have been no general
 elections to these two bodies since 1948, the authorities
 taking the position that such elections cannot be held
 until they re-establish control over the mainland.
 Beginning in 1969, *supplementary elections" for these
 central bodies have been held to choose additional
 representatives from Taiwan and adjacent islands. Through
 these supplementary elections, the most recent of which
 were held December 6, 1980, the authorities have increased
 the membership in the two bodies with the effect, in the
 Legislative Yuan for example, of raising the proportion
 of total seats open for periodic election from 10 percent
 to over 20 percent. Given the advanced age of the members
 elected on the mainland in 1948, members elected on Taiwan
 now constitute a majority of those regularly able to
 attend Legislative Yuan sessions.
 Since 1950, democratic institutions have been in operation
 at the provincial and local levels. Universal suffrage exists
 for all citizens twenty years of age or over.   Elections
 have been held regularly over the past two decades for
 provincial and municipal legislative offices. The Taiwan
 provincial governor and the mayors of the two municipalities,
 Taipei and Kaohsiung, however, are appointed by the central
 authorities, which in any case exercise considerably greater
 power than the local institutions.
 Despite the existence of two small, nominal opposition parties,
 Taiwan is effectively a one-party system. Candidates who op-
 pose the Kuomintang Party (KMT) in Taiwan elections run as
 independents or "non-party" candidates. Even though the large
 majority of candidates elected are from the KMT, independent
 candidates increasingly have been successful in the recent
 past. Among other independents elected in the December 1980
 elections were three who were related to Kaohsiung Incident
 defendants, one of whom received the second largest number
 of votes of any candidate in the elections.
 
 89-510 0 - 82 - 38
 
 
 584
 Independents face several disadvantages in the election pro-
 cess. The election law enacted in 1980 generally favors
 KMT candidates, because its provisions, many of which are
 ambiguous, are interpreted by the central election committee,
 which is controlled by the RMT. The law forbids the partici-
 pation of students, formerly a prime source of campaign
 workers for independent candidates, and allows only rallies
 approved by the authorities to be held in the week prior to
 the election. Independent candidates are further disadvan-
 taged by the authorities' control of the press. The daily
 press tends to give little or no publicity to the views and
 positions of the independents. The authorities allow some
 periodicals to publicize the views of independent candidates,
 but these magazines are subject to close scrutiny and
 frequent censorship by the security services. Prior to the
 December 1980 elections, the authorities effectively silenced
 all periodicals which supported independents, but this
 practice was not repeated in the provincial level elections
 in November 1981.
 There are few laws that discriminate against women; those
 which do relate mostly to divorce issues and inheritance.
 Women have been active in politics, and regulations govern-
 ing elections make some provision for guaranteed minimal
 representation of women in local and central legis-
 lative institutions. Rapid industrialization and a
 gradual liberalizing trend throughout society have served
 to improve the status of women. The percentage of women
 in institutions of higher learning has increased slightly
 over the past teh years, to approximately 40.7 percent dur-
 ing the 1979-1980 school year. Women now occupy prominent
 roles in such professions as business and publishing. A
 fledgling women's rights movement is slowly growing.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Viola-
 tions of Human Rights
 The Taiwan authorities have permitted some cooperation
 with outside organizations investigating human rights con-
 ditions. Representatives of international organizations
 have visited Taiwan and met with appropriate officials.
 The most recent visits were prompted by the Kaohsiung
 Incident trials. In March 1980 an American human rights
 delegation, led by Ramsey Clark, made a ten day visit to
 Taiwan, during which time its members were given the oppor-
 tunity to meet with oppositionist, KMT and military figures
 and to tour the prison facility at Green Island. In addi-
 tion, the authorities permitted representatives of Amnesty
 International, the International League for Human Rights,
 and the World Alliance of Reformed Churches to attend the
 sedition trial of the Kaohsiung Eight. These visits have
 had a modest effect in sensitizing many in Taiwan to the
 impact abroad of actions taken in Taiwan.
 In early 1981, Amnesty International submitted a memoran-
 dum to the Taiwan authorities urging that the Kaohsiung
 Incident defendants and other political prisoners be
 released unconditionally. In May 1981 Taipei's govern-
 ment information office responded with a six page document
 highlighting factual errors and offering some legal re-
 buttal of points made in the memorandum. The Taipei
 response also termed A.I.'s recommendation of "uncondi-
 tional release' for political prisoners "gross interference
 in the internal affairs of a state. . .
 
 
 585
 It must also be noted that the authorities actively en-
 couraged two Americans from Carnegie-Mellon University
 to travel to Taiwan to investigate allegations of human
 rights violations related to the death of Professor Chen
 wen-cheng, and did not challenge the results of their
 investigation.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 Taiwan has established an excellent record of providing
 for the social and economic needs of its people. In
 general, the enjoyment of economic benefits is available to
 the population as a whole without discrimination. The per
 capita GNP in 1981 is estimated at nearly $2,500. The over-
 all distribution of income is egalitarian, with the average
 income of the top 20 percent of income earners about four
 times greater than that of the bottom 20 percent. Unemploy-
 ment is 1.79 percent. In 1981 the authorities allocated
 more than 30 percent of the total budget to education,
 science, culture, and social programs.
 Although economic growth has recently fallen short of
 the spectacular rates achieved earlier (GNP grew at a
 rate of 6.5 percent in 1980, compared with the 1969-1979
 average rate of 10 percent), the economy remains healthy,
 and the prospects for continuing economic well-being
 are favorable, as the authorities attempt to shift the
 focus of their export-based economy to high-technology
 industries.
 Taiwan has developed an effective public health program
 and a system of health stations throughout the island
 -- a total of more than 10,000 medical care facilities.
 In 1979, Taiwan had 6.6 physicians, 6.4 nurses, and 21
 hospital beds for every 10,000 persons. Health promotion
 programs include maternal and child disease control, and
 environmental sanitation. Because of these public health
 programs and a generally good diet (in 1979, per capita
 daily caloric intake reached 2,845 and per capita daily
 intake of protein rose to 78.7 grams), major epidemic
 disease has been eradicated and life expectancy increased
 to 70 years for men, and nearly 75 years for women.
 Taiwan's birth control efforts have been successful in
 bringing the birth rate in 1980 down to 1.86%. This has
 been crucial in alleviating population tensions on the
 island, where the population density per square kilometer
 of cultivable land has reached nearly 2,000.
 In the area of housing, the Taiwan authorities have in-
 cluded major expenditures for public housing under a
 1976-1982 development plan. Construction of public
 housing units will help alleviate congested housing
 conditions, which have resulted from rapid urbanization
 in Taiwan's major cities. In 1980 the authorities
 began a program to assist individuals to buy homes.
 Education is one of the main concerns of the authorities
 and the population in general. Statistics show that 89.3
 percent of the population over the age of 6 are literate.
 Ninety-nine percent of school-age children are currently in
 school and free compulsory education is available through
 junior high school. About 60 percent of junior high school
 graduates pass examinations and enter three-year senior
 high and vocational school programs. Entry into Taiwan's
 extensive system of higher education is also based on com-
 petitive exams, and departures from a strict merit system
 are almost nonexistent. In 1979, about 20.5 percent of
 college-age youth were enrolled as undergraduate or
 graduate students.
