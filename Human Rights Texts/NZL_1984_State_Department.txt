 NEW ZEALAND
 New Zealand has an exemplary record on human rights and
 continues efforts to improve and broaden respect for such
 rights. Its firm tradition of democracy dates back to its
 founding in the 19th century. Personal freedom, freedom of
 religion and of the press, universal suffrage, rule of law,
 respect for minority rights, concern for the economically
 deprived, free trade union affiliation, and humane treatment
 of prisoners remain deeply ingrained principles in New Zealand
 society and are fundamental, unquestioned tenets of its
 governance. Its government is a multi-party parliamentary
 democracy in both theory and practice and its economy is based
 on free market enterprise. During 1984 there were no major
 incidents in New Zealand which might have influenced its
 already excellent record in the field of human rights.
 However, there is public acknowledgement that despite New
 Zealand's excellent human rights record there is room for
 improvement in the rights of women and minorities.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Killing for political motives, whether by the Government or by
 political organizations, does not occur.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no reports of secret arrests, clandestine
 detentions, or abductions.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and cruel or degrading treatment or punishment are
 illegal under New Zealand law and not practiced. Use of
 excessive force by the poliee and abuse of prisoners are not
 tolerated and the Government has adequate procedures to deal
 with any allegations of such treatment. Capital punishment
 remains illegal and summary executions are non-existent.
 Prison and detention facilities enjoy an excellent reputation
 for providing adequate shelter, food, and medical care.
 Prisoners are permitted regular visits by their relatives and
 lawyers. All prisoners are treated equally.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There are no reports of political prisoners. Habeas corpus
 exists and is practiced. Preventive detention does not
 exist. Those arrested under New Zealand law are charged
 promptly and allowed access to an attorney of their choosing.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 New Zealand law guarantees the right to a fair, public trial
 and this right is faithfully honored. Defendants are charged
 promptly after their arrest, and all charges are stated
 formally and clearly. Defendants are entitled to counsel,
 with free private access guaranteed. The judicial system
 operates independently of government interference or

 NEW ZEALAND
 influence. There are no special courts to deal with political
 or security offenses. Under New Zealand's legal system,
 defendants are able to call witnesses, present evidence, and
 cross-examine prosecution witnesses at trials, and they remain
 free of double jeopardy.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The New Zealand Government does not permit arbitrary
 interference with the privacy, family, home, or correspondence
 of its citizens.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 New Zealand has a long tradition of free speech and press and
 these rights are guaranteed by numerous common law cases. The
 Government makes no attempt to censor or control the media
 apart from legislated exceptions relating to pornographic and
 similar materials and laws against defamation. Opposition
 viewpoints are freely discussed both in public and in the
 media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The New Zealand population enjoys the right to assemble
 freely, without restriction, and this applies equally to the
 freedom of association. Trade unions, which have a long
 tradition in New Zealand, enjoy these same rights. The
 Government does not interfere in union matters and there are
 no state-organized unions. Public sector. employees generally
 are not prohibited from collective bargaining and striking but
 there are some limited exceptions. These exceptions are
 related to the safety and well-being of the public. New
 Zealand unions may freely associate with international labor
 organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All religions can be practiced freely in New Zealand without
 government interference. There is no state or government
 favored religion, nor is any advantage given to any particular
 faith.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is complete freedom of internal and external travel,
 emigration, and repatriation. The right of voluntary
 repatriation is guaranteed. Each citizen enjoys the right to
 change his residence or workplace at will. New Zealand
 continues to be responsive, within the limits of its
 resources, to the resettlement needs of refugees. All asylum
 cases are considered under the same guidelines as those for
 refugees, as defined under the 1951 convention relating to
 refugees.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of
 Citizens to Change Their Government
 The Government is genuinely elected by its people, who
 participate freely in all its political processes. New
 Zealand is a multiparty parliamentary state. Two primary
 parties, Labour and National, dominate the political scene.
 During 1983, a new political party, the New Zealand Party, was
 established; it gained 12 percent of the vote but no seats in
 the July 14, 1984, national elections. The fourth party of
 significance, the Social Credit Party, captured 8 percent of
 the vote in that election and won two seats. Suffrage is
 universal for persons 18 years of age and older. Voting rates
 are high- and participation in political groups common. All
 opposition groups have every opportunity to voice their views,
 and no groups are denied the right to political participation
 or suffrage. Problems of nationality, citizenship, or
 statelessness do not exist.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no requests for such international or
 non-governmental investigations. New Zealand's commitment to
 protecting human rights and opposing discrimination is
 illustrated by its adherence to a number of United Nations
 conventions including the International Covenant on Economic,
 Social, and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant of
 Civil and Political Rights. Prominent among the numerous
 organizations which exist to protect human rights and oppose
 various forms of discrimination are the New Zealand Human
 Rights Commission, the New Zealand Council for Civil
 Liberties, the Citizens' Association for Racial Equality, the
 New Zealand Chapter of the International Commission of
 Jurists, the Race Relations Conciliator, the National
 Organization of Women, and the New Zealand Branch of Amnesty
 International. These groups serve to focus public and
 government attention on possible instances of human rights
 violations both in and outside of New Zealand. Amnesty
 International's 1984 report does not include a section on New
 Zealand. The Freedom House 1984-1985 report calls New Zealand
 'free.*
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 New Zealand society shows growing sensitivity to the status of
 women and Maoris, primarily in education and employment.
 Women are legally equal with men and participate freely in all
 phases of New Zealand life. The number of women
 Parliamentarians was increased from eight to twelve by the
 1984 national elections. Both major political parties are
 headed by women. A Ministry for Women's Affairs has been
 established by the new Labour Government, which also plans to
 ratify the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of
 Discrimination Against Women. In addition, the Human Rights
 Commission continues to hear complaints about discrimination;
 the largest category of complaints concerns discrimination
 against women in employment. Food, shelter, health care, and
 education are available to all New Zealanders regardless of
 race, religion, sex, ethnic background, or political belief.

 Maoris still lag significantly behind non-Maoris in important
 categories, e.g., median income levels, unemployment levels,
 educational achievement, and life expectancy. Maori
 dissatisfaction with this situation was reflected in a Maori
 nationwide 'Summit Conference" held in October. This resulted
 in a series of recommendations including for establishment of
 a Naori Economic Development Commission, revision of
 legislation so as to permit more development of Maori land,
 constitutional measures to safeguard Maori rights, and an
 increase in Maori representation on government bodies.
 The population of New Zealand in 1984 was 3,251,000 with a
 growth rate of 1.40 percent. Per capita GNP (US dollars) as
 of 1982 was $7,916.30. Life expectancy at birth in 1984 was
 73.85 years. The infant mortality rate during 1984 decreased
 to 11.30 per 1,000 live births. Primary school enrollment in
 1987 as a percentage of age group is 105.5 percent for the
 whole population, 106.38 percent for males and 104.59 percent
 for females. As of 1981 the calorie supply as a percent of
 requirements was 129.0 percent.
