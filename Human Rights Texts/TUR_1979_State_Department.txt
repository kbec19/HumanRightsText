 TURKEY
 Turkey has a vigorous, multi-party, democratic system in
 which strong traditions of governmental responsibility to
 parliament, an independent judiciary, and a free press
 work to safeguard political and civil rights as well as
 the economic interests of the citizen. It is beset, how-
 ever, by serious political violence from both right and
 left wing extremists and faces severe economic problems.
 Turkey's constitution, penal code, and administrative
 regulations provide substantial protections for individual
 rights. To date, martial law, authorized by the Turkish
 parliament in December 1978 because of domestic terrorism
 and renewed every two months since, has been implemented
 in strict accordance with law. Initially, martial law
 was applied in 13 of Turkey's 67 provinces. It was sub-
 sequently extended to six others. Despite the high level
 of politically-motivated violence in Turkey, (over 2,000
 deaths in the past two years) the civil and military
 authorities have consistently shown restraint and respect
 for due process.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Allegations of brutality by police officials during gues-
 tioning have appeared in the Turkish press. Such allega-
 tions are routinely investigated. At least some allega--
 tions may have been politically motivated since there have
 been no follow-up reports of civil actions against pur-
 ported offenders. While isolated incidents of prisoner
 abuse may occur, there is no evidence that torture is used
 or condoned as a matter of policy. Torture is prohibited
 by the constitution, and effective legal remedies are
 available through the court system.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment is prohibited by the
 constitution and there is no indication that such practices
 are condoned in Turkey. Conditions in some Turkish prisons
 are austere and overcrowded, largely as a result of Turkey's
 severe economic difficulties and lack of resources for
 prison improvements.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed
 by the constitution and is respected in practice by both
 civil and martial law authorities.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials in Turkey are open, proceedings are impartial, and
 defense lawyers are available under all circumstances.

 672
 Trials in martial law courts are conducted under the
 same procedural rules that apply to civilian courts.
 Trials are open, defendents are allowed to have civilian
 lawyers of their own choosing, and there is an appeals
 procedure.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Privacy of the home is protected by law, the require-
 ments of which are met.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Governmental policies relating to the fulfillment of
 these vital needs are necessarily limited by the economic re-
 sources of the country. Recent Turkish governments have
 pursued egalitarian economic and social policies designed
 to meet basic social needs and to promote social mobility.
 These include a progressive tax system; protection of the
 rights of labor, such as the right to organize, bargain
 collectively, and strike; pricing policies and controls
 for essential foodstuffs; free hospitals; comprehensive
 social security and aid to the aged; and free education
 through university level. Available statistics on in-
 come distribution indicate that the growing middle class
 has benefited most from these policies. Poorer groups
 have also benefited, however. Between 1972 and 1977,
 real income of industrial workers increased 33 percent,
 and the income of the poorest (largely rural) elements
 increased slightly. Living conditions in Turkey have
 improved significantly since 1960. For example, life
 expectancy at birth has increased from 49 to 57 years;
 the population per physician ratio has dropped from
 3,000 to 2,130; the population per hospital bed ratio
 has dropped from 650 to 460; the per capita calorie con-
 sumption level, as a percentage of requirement, has in-
 creased from 110 to 113; and the adult literacy rate is
 up from 40 to 55 percent.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech, press, religion and assembly is guar-
 anteed by the constitution. Freedom of speech is unim-
 peded. The press is free and lively. The only limita-
 tion on such expression is an article in the criminal
 code forbidding communist propaganda. Nonetheless, radi-
 cal-leftist parties were allowed equal television time
 with the major government and opposition parties during
 the 1979 senate -elections. Undbr martial law, a few ex-
 tremist publications have been banned in provinces where
 martial law is in effect. On several occasions, journal-
 ists have been detained for violations of martial law
 regulations.
 
 
 673
 Freedom of worship is provided for in the constitution.
 In the case of non-Muslim minorities, it is further
 guaranteed by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. These pro-
 visions are respected in practice. Due to the strong
 secular nature of the Turkish republic, however, parti-
 cipation by the clergy in activities outside a religious
 institution is restricted. Minority religious groups
 enjoy normal civil and political liberties. The government
 has continued its efforts to facilitate the free function-
 ing of treaty-protected institutions, such as churches and
 schools, of the Armenian, Greek, and Jewish minorities.
 During 1979, government representatives met on several
 occasions with minority community leaders to discuss prob-
 lems and seek solutions. In August 1979, the government
 exempted by decree Greek minority churches from payment
 of fees assessed by law on all religious institutions --
 Muslim, Christian and Jewish. However, bureaucratic diffi-
 culties at lower levels -- particularly in the areas of
 obtaining permits for new construction or repairs -- con-
 tinue to pose problems for minority communities. Freedom
 of assembly provided for in the constitution can be
 restricted only for the purpose of maintaining public
 .order. The only practical effect of this restriction is
 the requirement for advance notification of large public
 meetings.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, and Emigration
 There is freedom of movement and emigration. However, be-
 cause of severe foreign exchange shortages, foreign travel
 for the purpose of tourism has been limited to one trip
 abroad every three years and one trip each year to the
 northern area of Cyprus.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There is free participation in the political process. The
 increase in politically-motivated violence by extremist
 elements has not noticeably inhibited this freedom. In
 fact, voting participation in the partial senate and
 national assembly by-elections of October 14, 1979, topped
 76 percent of registered voters, despite threats by extrem-
 ists to disrupt balloting. Elections are openly contested
 and honest. Changes made in the election laws in 1979
 reduced possibilities of double voting and fraud. Articles
 of the criminal code forbid the formation of parties which
 advocate the division of the society on class lines.
 The Turkish constitution and other laws provide for free and
 equal participation of women in the political process.
 Psychological and social impediments to the full participa-
 tion of women in Turkey's economic and political life con-
 tinue to exist, however, particularly in rural areas.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights   --,            5
 The Department of State is not aware of any recent requests
 for outside investigation.  Amnesty International has, with
 the concurrence of the Turkish government, established a
 national section in Turkey. In light of the Turkish mili-
 tary intervention in 1974 and the continued presence of
 Turkish armed forces in northefn Cyprus, Turkey shares re-
 sponsibility for the human rights situation on the island.
 The report relating to Cyprus-addresses this question.
