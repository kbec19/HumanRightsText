 TOGO
 Togo is a one-party state. Its economy is a mixture of
 government and private enterprises. Natural resources are
 limited. A strong executive, a national assembly and the
 supremacy of the ruling party (Rassemblement de Peuple
 Togolais, RPT) were .institutionalized by the Constitution of
 the-Third Republic which went into effect January 1, 1980.
 Togo's legal system includes a supreme court and a court of
 appeals which function under the strong influence of the
 executive branch. The government argues that national unity
 and economic development-have priority over individual
 political and civil liberties. President Eyadema has
 developed a nationalist philosophy to unify an ethnically
 diverse population and has strongly promoted country-wide
 economic and social development with priority emphasis yiven
 to agriculture. Women and members of all ethnic groups are
 encouraged to participate in economic development and,
 within the context of the single party state, political
 life. Activities outside the single political party are
 suppressed.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Togolese authorities are specifically enjoined by the
 president from torturing detainees. Some released prisoners
 claim to have been beaten and subjected to hard labor
 practices. Allegations that some prisoners are subject to
 electric shock have not been confirmed.   Some cases of
 torture have occurred, however. Trial defendants sometimes
 claim that their confessions to the police were coerced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Prison conditions in Togo are harsh and Lome's central
 prison is crowded and facilities are rudimentary. Families
 are allowed to visit and to provide food. Adequate food,
 sanitation and medical care are provided at Lome's main
 detention facility, but space, light and ventilation are
 limited. Reports describe overcrowding, poor sanitation,
 unhygienic conditions, and inadequate food service in most
 places of detention outside of Lome. Only military and
 paramilitary personnel are normally granted access to
 military-prisons and detention facilities in Lome, Lama-Kara
 and Temedja where it is reported that forced marches, hard
 labor and beatings nave been imposed on prisoners. A
 -foreign couple who arrived in Togo earlier this year without
 visas were accidentally placed in a detention room at Lome's
 central police headquarters with a Togolese prisoner, whom
 they claimed-was beaten by a female police officer. When
 the presence of the foreign couple was noted, they were
 quickly escorted from the room and were threatened with
 the. sme.treatment if they mentioned what they had seen
 taking place. -Summary.executions have not occurred in Togo
 during President Eyauema's regime. There are no reports of
 discrimination in Togolese prisons based on sex, race,
 religion or tribal origin.

 c. Disappearances
 There are no reports tnat people are abducted, secretly
 arrested, held in clandestine detention or suffer prolonged
 "disappearance" at the hands official or quasi-official
 security forces in Togo.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Togolese legal system does not include the writ of
 habeas corpus. The government detains individuals adminis-
 tratively for activities it considers corrupt or harmful to
 national unity and security. Such detentions are usually
 brief but have no fixed term. Unconfirmed reports estimate
 that approximately 200 political detainees are held through-
 out the country. President Eyadema publicly stated in 1980
 that Togo had only six political prisoners (37 of 43 political
 prisoners were released in early 1980). Arrests for drug
 trafficking and official corruption are publicized.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Togolese legal and judicial procedures are based on the
 French system for most categories of cases and on tradi-
 tional law for local or family disputes. A new constitution
 was voted into effect in December 1979 and in its preamble
 declares adherence to the charters of the United Nations,
 the Economic Community of West African States and the
 Universal Declaration on Human Rights. The constitution
 guarantees each citizen the rights of liberty and human
 dignity, political liberty, philosophical or religious
 liberty, free unions, property and economic and social
 rights in accordance with the law. A new individual and
 family code approved by the national assembly and published
 in April 1980 is starting to be applied. A penal code for
 civilians has been approved and promulgated. Virtually all
 defendants have a public trial with the right to be repre-
 sented by counsel. Counsel is appointed by the government
 in those cases where the defendant cannot afford the attorney
 fees. The attorney is accorded permission to see the
 defendant in prison and engage in private discussions with
 him. Defendant and counsel are formally notified of charges
 in writing. Special courts (state security, embezzlement of
 public funds, violent crimes) observe the same standards of
 justice as regular courts.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Authorization by a judge or senior police official is normally
 required for physical searches of private residences in
 both civil and criminal cases. In national security matters
 searches without formal authorization are permitted in some
 cases.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech is restricted and a free press does not
 exist. The government controls the media and does not
 permit publication or circulation of material criticizing
 its policies or personalities. Authorities occasionally
 
 
 287
 confiscate issues of foreign publications containing articles
 considered to be critical of the government. Freedom of
 religion is enjoyed by most Togolese. The right to assembly
 is. subject to governmental approval.
 .b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Free.movement, including domestic and foreign travel and
 emigration, is allowed for Togolese and foreigners with
 .few exceptions. Foreign travel by individuals who have
 allegedly posed a threat to national security is restricted.
 Two individuals, Kodjovi de Souza and Teyi Lawson, whose
 .aim was to overthrow the Eyadema government, were repatriated
 from Accra against.their will but with the acquiescence
 of the Ghanaian government in 1979. Businessman Bani Lawson
 was also.-forcibly repatriated from Niamey in 1979, presumably
 .with-the acquiescence of the Nigerien government. Togo
 .observes the Common Market and West African Economic Community
 conventions on freedom of passage and temporary residence.
 Citizens of various African countries resident in Togo are
 ï¿½ free -to return-to their countries of-origin without Togolese
 government interference.
 .c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Togo is a single party state, under the leadership of*
 President Eyadema. Participation in the political process
 can only be through the single party, the Togolese People's
 Rally (RPT) which is the.only political party recognized by
 the .constitution. All regions of Togo, all ethnic groups,
 .and both. sexes -are represented :in'Togo's government, its
 single party, and its 67-member national assembly. No
 "opposition.organizations are permitted. within the single
 party system, active participants may express their views on
 such issues as the functioning of the government and the
 behavior of its subordinate officials. Frequent meetings of
 the single political party at various levels can serve as a
 consultative process in the formation of legislation. Women
 have not traditionally had a role equal to that of men in
 .the political process, but the government is encouraging
 greater participation by women. Currently four women serve
 on the 22-member central committee of the party. The
 .minister for social affairs and women's condition and the
 minister delegate at the presidency in charge of relations
 with. the parliament are women. There are women in the Togolese
 foreign service.
 The single national trade union federation, La Confeder-
 ation Nationale.des Travailleurs du Togo (CNTT), is controlled
 by the national party. Through its various component trade
 unions, it promotes economic and social reform, worker
 :education and labor cooperatives. The CNTT has the right to
 have a:membership fee check-off system for salaried workers.
 Workers are protected by a labor code, minimum wage law,
 guarantees against termination without cause and a national
 social security system. The labor code establishes an
 elaborate mechanism for collective bargaining, arbitration
 and, as a last resort, the use of strikes. Some wage increases
 occur as a result of collective bargaining, but are generally
 
 
 288
 the result of presidential decree. Strikes are strongly
 discouraged but do occur, as in August 1980 when taxi
 drivers protested the maintenance of fixed rates after a
 rise in fuel prices. After 36 hours of work stoppage and
 negotiations between strike leaders with the union and
 government officials, the taxis rolled again and a new fare
 schedule was announced.   The government decreed a raise in
 taxi fares without the pressure of a work stoppage in July
 1981.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government of Togo has agreed to host an international
 conference in October 1982 entitled "The Rights of Children
 in Africa." Also, the government has agreed to establish a
 new school for the study of international human rights at the
 University of Benin in Lome, coinciding with the October 1982
 conference.
 The government of Togo in the past has invited interna-
 tional orgnizations, such as Amnesty International, to visit
 Togo to investigate charges of human rights violations.
 Amnesty International sent an observer to the 1979 "mercenary"
 trial of those accused of participation in the 1977 coup
 plot, but did not have access to the dossier (file of
 evidence collected by the magistrate in charge of the
 preliminary judicial investigations). Since the 1979 trial,
 Amnesty International and the government of Togo have
 exchanged public charges and countercharges concerning human
 rights violations in Togo. In 1980 representatives of
 Amnesty International visited Togo. Nevertheless, during
 1981,.the government was responsive to Amnesty International
 requests for information on detainees.
 The preamble of the 1979 constitution declares adherence
 to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. There are
 no organizations based within Togo that report on or observe
 human rights violations.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Togo is listed among the 36 poorest countries in the
 world (34th) by the World Bank. Less endowed in natural
 weal h than many African countries, Togo, with a population
 of 2.47 million and land area the size of West Virginia
 (50,700 kms), lacks the basic economic ingredients necessary
 to appreciably increase its citizens' standard of living.
 Togo's economic and social development efforts have marginally
 increased the country's living standards. Any analysis of
 the effect of modern institutions on life in Togo must take
 into account its current state of socio-economic development
 which is, for the overwhelming majority of Togolese, subsis-
 tence farming. Most Togolese peasants use the roads and
 wells that are built by the government, send their children
 to government schools and use the sparsely scattered dispen-
 saries that are manned by government health personnel. A
 smaller number receive benefits for rural electrification,
 
 
 potable water and agricultural development programs. For
 the vast majority, however, the weather is infinitely more
 important for their welfare than the government.
 Except during periods of drought, enough food is available
 to reasonably sustain the population. Public begging is
 infrequent and. limited to the handicapped. For the majority
 of Togolese, life's economic benefits are limited to meals,
 a change of clothes and a mud hut. GNP exceeded $1 billion
 for the first time in 1980 ($1.05 billion) with per capita
 GNP projectd at $426. Growth in real GDP averaged less than
 three per cent per annum during the 1975-1980 period, barely
 keeping pace with population growth of 2.4 (1970-1979).
 Most recent estimates place 42 of the urban population below
 the absolute poverty level (1974-1978). Togo's high fertility
 rate, 6.5 percent (1979), indicates that the average rural
 families, who are the majority of the population, still
 perceive large families as economically advantageous.
 Tropical diseases are endemic in Togo. According to the
 latest available figures (1970) 16.3 percent of Togolese
 infants do not survive their first year of life. Sanitation
 standards are low or nonexistent. Life expectancy at
 birth is 47 years (1979). Forty-nine percent of the urban
 population and 10 percent of the rural population has
 access to safe water (16 countrywide, 1975). Net available food
 supplies could theoretically provide just 90 percent of the
 caloric nutritional needs of the total population (1977)
 School attendance is compulsory until age 15. Primary
 education is available throughout the country and, since
 many students start school late and repeat school years, the
 number of places available for primary education exceeded
 the number of.children of primary school age (6-11) in
 1979/80, (102 percent). Available places in secondary
 schools were equal to only 25 percent of the 12-17 year
 population and available places in higher education institu-
 tions were equal to Just one percent of the 20-24 year
 population. School enrollment in Togo has increased
 annually. The adult literacy rate is low (male 27 percent,
 .female 7 percent, 1981), and the quality of education in
 public schools is inadequate.
