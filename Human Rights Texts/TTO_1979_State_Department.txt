 TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
 
 A former British Colony, Trinidad and Tobago inherited
 many of its political and legal forms and practices -
 - strongly emphasizing rights of the person -- from the
 United Kingdom. Though multi-racial and religiously
 diverse, the country is a stable, multi-party, parlia-
 mentary democracy with an excellent overall record of
 human rights observance. The judiciary is independent
 and the Privy Council in the United Kingdom serves as
 the court of final appeal.
 With a relative abundance of oil and gas, Trinidad and
 Tobago has one of the highest per capita incomes in the
 area (slightly over U.S. $2,000). The economy is basically
 free enterprise with mixed private/state ownership of
 many of the major facilities. The tax system is progres-
 sive. The literacy rate is over 95 per cent. There
 is universal adult suffrage, and free and fair elections
 are held regularly. The People's National Movement has
 remained in power through victories at the polls since
 before independence was attained in 1962. The "indepen-
 dence constitution" was superseded in 1976 by a republican
 constitution which, like its predecessor, enshrines inter-
 nationally-accepted fundamental rights and freedoms without
 discrimination by reason of race, origin, color, religion
 or sex. Occasional charges of over-zealousness by the
 police and excessive delays between arrest and trial
 are discussed openly and criticized demonstrates the
 freedom of expression which the citizens enjoy and the
 attention the public gives to allegations of shortcomings
 in the country's administration of justice.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is forbidden under the laws of Trinidad and Tobago
 and does not occur in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The constitution forbids the imposition of cruel and
 unusual treatment or punishment. This constitutional
 provision is observed to a high degree, though there
 have been allegations of excessive police roughness from
 time to time in individual cases; police officers on
 occasion have been convicted of such illegal behavior.
 Despite some improvements in recent years, physical condi-
 tions in the prisons remain deplorable. A commission
 of inquiry has been studying the prisons for several
 years and is expected to submit its final report and
 recommendations in the near future.

 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Protection against arbitrary detention or imprisonment
 is constitutionally guaranteed, as is the remedy of habeas
 corpus. There have been instances, however, where a
 suspected person has been held under detention for some
 time before charges were formally laid. A more frequently
 mentioned criticism is excessive delay between arrest
 and trial. Such delays, which can run from one to three
 years in the case of capital crimes, have been described
 by the Chief Justice as "a blot on the due administration
 of justice" in the country. Both shortcomings are the
 result of an overburdened legal system, not government
 policy. There are no political prisoners in Trinidad
 and Tobago.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of accused persons to a fair and public hearing
 by an independent and impartial tribunal in criminal
 cases is guaranteed under the constitution and is well
 observed in practice. In addition, the state provides
 legal aid to indigent citizens in both civil and criminal
 matters.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution provides that security of the person
 and enjoyment of property are rights of which no one
 may be deprived except by due process of law. The pro-
 vision covers the sanctity of the home and is observed.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Especially since the large increase in petroleum export
 earnings after 1973, the government of Trinidad and Tobago
 has initiated a number of ambitious programs intended
 to fulfill the vital needs of the population and improve
 the overall quality of life. Staple food items, important
 elements in the budgets of lower income groups, are kept
 at relatively low, government-subsidized prices, and
 a free school feeding program is in preparation. Food
 stamps and free passes for use on public transportation
 are made available to the elderly and other needy persons.
 Various government-owned or assisted housing schemes
 are in the planning or construction stage. One major
 new hospital has been built, plans are underway for mod-
 ernizing and expanding the country's two biggest hospitals,
 
 
 409
 and a network of rural health care centers is nearing
 completion. The education system is being expanded and
 revised in an effort to improve job market preparation
 for students who do not plan to go on to the university.
 Numerous new or modernized schools and other educational
 facilities are being planned or constructed.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of expression, the press, religious belief and
 observance, and association and assembly are constitu-
 tionally guaranteed and respected in practice. Several
 human rights organizations operate.freely and openly
 in the country, educating the public, calling attention
 to alleged shortcomings and violations, and advocating
 a more equitable distribution of the fruits of prosperity.
 The press is vigorous and uncensored.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement within
 the country, foreign travel, .or emigration, all of which
 are covered under the constitution's freedom of movement
 provision.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 All citizens, regardless of sex, race, or religion, may
 take part in the political process, and the right to
 join political parties and to express political views
 is secured by the constitution. Numerous political parties
 exist and participate in elections, which are held regu-
 larly. Trade unions and other associations function
 freely, enjoying full rights to organize, bargain collec-
 tively and strike. Women are free to participate fully
 in virtually all aspects of national life; they receive
 the same pay as men for the same work. Women occupy
 many important positions in government, including several
 of ministerial rank. Women are also well-represented
 in the professions and business, although there are few
 women at the top level of large enterprises. The govern-
 ment is encouraging women to take greater advantage of
 the opportunities available to them.

 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights:
 The Government of Trinidad and Tobago supports inter-
 national efforts to promote the observance of human rights
 and does not object in principle to international and
 non-governmental investigations of alleged human rights
 violations. The government has, however, publicly expres-
 sed its concern that allegations of human rights violations
 could lead to unwarranted interference in the internal
 affairs of sovereign states and that investigations of
 such allegations could be used by the strong to apply
 pressure on the weak. The government does not support
 the use of non-economic (e.g., human rights) criteria
 in the consideration by international financial institu-
 tions and organizations of loans or other assistance
 requests. Trinidad and Tobago has not yet signed the
 Inter-American Human Rights Convention.
 With its excellent human rights record, Trinidad and
 Tobago has never been the subject of international, govern-
 mental or private investigation in the human rights field,
 although Amnesty International has criticized the existence
 of the death penalty.
