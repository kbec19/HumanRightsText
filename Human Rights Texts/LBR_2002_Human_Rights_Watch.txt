LIBERIA
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Continued violence threatened to plunge Liberia back into civil war after nearly
five years of shaky transition to peace. Fierce fighting continued to rage in the
country’s north since the start of a rebel incursion in July 2000, the fifth serious outbreak
of violence since the 1997 elections that ended the civil war. The fighting and
repression blocked recovery efforts with the nation’s economy in tatters, 80 percent
of the workforce unemployed and 80 percent illiteracy.Basic services such as health
care, communications, electricity, and the public supply of drinking water
remained extremely limited. Public and private institutions deteriorated amid
widespread corruption and fear.
Fighting between government forces and the rebel group, Liberians United for
Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD), intensified in northern Lofa County.
Amid the violence, widespread human rights abuses took place against civilians,
including women and children. Liberian government troops and rebels alike
detained, tortured, or killed hundreds of civilians, raping women and girls at will,
and forcing men and boys to fight. Reports by Amnesty International found that
government security forces—especially the Anti-Terrorist Unit (ATU), a security
force accountable only to President Taylor—detained, tortured, or executed more
than two hundred civilians suspected of supporting rebels, raping some of them.
The government denied these allegations and took no steps to investigate, punish,
or end the abuses. In April 2001, President Taylor called up 15,000 former fighters
from the faction he had led during the civil war to combat the growing rebel threat.
As of September, fighting had spread southward to within sixty miles of the capital,
Monrovia.
Responding to the rebel action, government repression of civil society continued
to intensify. President Taylor’s government functioned without accountability,
independent of an ineffective judiciary and legislature that operated in fear of the
executive. Ethnic Mandingo citizens, whom the government indiscriminately
accused of supporting the rebels, faced growing discrimination, arbitrary arrests,
and violence based solely on their ethnicity. In March, state security troops stormed
the University of Liberia in Monrovia, assaulting and arresting unarmed students
meeting to raise legal fees for detained journalists.More than forty students were
reportedly tortured and female students raped in the raid by the ATU and the
Special Operation Division, a special police unit.More than fifteen student leaders
from the University of Liberia went into exile in May following the justice minister’s
public claim that rebel collaborators operated from their campus. In August,
in an attempt to allay growing criticism, President Taylor freed three of thirteen
prominent ethnic Krahn leaders imprisoned on treason charges since 1998, pardoned
exiled opposition leaders, and announced an amnesty for rebels who disarmed.
Press censorship and arrests of journalists continued, as President Taylor and
other high-ranking officials blamed them for negative international publicity. In
February, four journalists from the Daily newspaper were arrested and held for
over a month on espionage charges following a report questioning government
spending on helicopter repairs. The government shut down four independent
newspapers in connection with the report. Harassment continued with the arrest
in August of the editor of the Monrovia Guardian following an article on police
brutality.The information minister announced in April that all war-related reports
had to be cleared by him. The government also tightened restrictions on foreign
journalists.
With most Liberians dependent on radio for their news, government silencing
of independent radio broadcasts deprived them of information. In August, President
Taylor banned all radio stations but the three currently licensed—his private
Liberian Communications Network and two others that only operated infrequently.
At the same time, he refused to lift a ban on Veritas, a station of Liberia’s
Roman Catholic Church, and the independent Star radio.
The violence was part of a growing subregional struggle over control of diamonds
and other resources. In 2001, President Taylor shifted his commercial focus
from diamonds to logging, relying on the same men who organized the arms-fordiamonds
trade to export timber and ship weapons from Monrovia to Sierra
Leone. Illustrating the corruption at the heart of the Taylor government, two of the
individuals involved in diamond trading sat on the board of directors of the Liberian
Forestry Development Authority that oversees logging. A Strategic Commodities
Act reportedly passed secretly in 2000 gave President Taylor “the sole power to
execute, negotiate and conclude all commercial contracts or agreements with any
foreign or domestic investor” for designated commodities, including timber and
diamonds. The act was challenged as unconstitutional by the legal community.
Divisions and tensions in the subregion deepened as the internal conflicts
within Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea continued to spill across the borders.
Guinea and Liberia accused each other of supporting armed anti-government
rebels, and the Sierra Leonean government accused Liberia of providing support to
the Sierra Leonean rebel group, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF).
The insecurity and violence in the subregion displaced thousands of Liberians.
Humanitarian agencies estimated in July 2001 that more than 40,000 persons had
been newly displaced in Lofa County since April. In the country’s six internally displaced
camps, about 70 percent were women and children who had fled south into
areas with scarce food, clean water, shelter, or medical assistance. An unknown
number remained in areas inaccessible to humanitarian workers, and without
assistance in unsafe conditions in forests and villages.
Liberians also fled across the borders. In 2001, some 15,000 Liberians fled to
Sierra Leone and nearly 5,000 to Ivory Coast.Although some Liberians were able to
flee into Guinea, the Guinean government officially closed the border to Liberian
refugees from Lofa County following cross-border fighting between Liberian,
Guinean, and Sierra Leonean rebel and government forces in late 2000. This crossborder
fighting also affected a longstanding Liberian refugee population that had
been in Guinea for the past decade. Guinean security and civilians also targeted refugees for attack following xenophobic statements by President Lansana Conte in
September 2000. In early 2001, as the violence at the border subsided, the Office of
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Guinean government
relocated some 60,000 refugees (largely Sierra Leoneans) to inland camps in
Guinea. In May 2001, the relocation program ended and an unknown number of
refugees chose to remain at the embattled border.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Following the escalation of fighting in Lofa County and a stinging December
2000 U.N. report on Liberian support of Sierra Leonean rebels, the government
intensified attacks on human rights groups. Liberian security forces harassed,
arrested, and tortured perceived critics, and human rights activists continued to
flee the country in fear of government reprisals. Despite the threats, a small but
dedicated human rights community continued to work in Liberia.
The leader of the Catholic Church’s Justice and Peace Commission, a key human
rights defender, said in March that he had received threats from “prominent individuals”
in retaliation for a report critical of the government’s human rights record.
The commission’s premises,which had been the object of previous attacks by security
forces, were burglarized a few months later.Despite the climate of fear, human
rights organizations persisted in their activities. By contrast, the government’s
National Human Rights Commission was inactive.
Thompson Ade-Bayo, a human rights activist who had been in hiding for a
week, was arrested and detained by the police in September.He was wanted for criticizing
as illegal the government’s anti-terrorist security unit, which he had
described as functioning like President Taylor’s private army.
Lawyers in the Liberian National Bar Association came under attack for speaking
out against the lack of due process in the courts. In October, two lawyers—Marcus
Jones, vice president of the Liberia National Bar and Ishmael Campbell,
president of the Montserrado County Bar—were ordered detained by the House of
Representatives and fined after they protested its order for the detention of their
colleague and Bar Association president Emmanuel Wureh. Wureh was detained
for contempt of court in late September, but was released the first week of October
after a week-long boycott of courts by lawyers. The two lawyers had called the
House of Representative’s order “unconstitutional” and urged a boycott of the
courts. Although the two paid the fine, they were informed that they would be
detained until March 2002 unless they retracted their statement. On October 11,
lawyers started a second round of boycotts to protest the continued detention of
their two colleagues.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
A downturn in foreign aid for development and relief efforts created a humanitarian
crisis. Relief organizations struggling to help Liberians displaced by war expressed strong concerns over dwindling resources.Donors stayed away, accusing
the Taylor government’s of human rights violations, poor economic policies, and
continuing involvement in arms smuggling.
United Nations
The U.N. Security Council played an active role in attempting to end the armsfor-
diamonds trade in Liberia and the subregion. In December 2000, the U.N. panel
monitoring compliance with the arms embargo placed on supplies to the RUF in
Sierra Leone reported that the Liberian logging industry played a key role in arms
trafficking. In May, the Security Council imposed a ban on Liberian diamond
exports (believed in fact to derive mostly from Sierra Leone), as well as an arms
embargo on Liberia itself, and a ban on foreign travel by President Taylor and more
than 130 senior government officials and their spouses.An October 2001 report for
the Security Council prepared by the Independent Panel of Experts found that illegal
arms shipments to Liberia continued despite the arms embargo.
In response to the international scrutiny, the government made some gestures.
In January, it grounded all aircraft registered in Liberia to review their legality, following
accusations that Liberian-registered airplanes were flying arms to Sierra
Leone. In March, Liberia banned diamond exports as well as imports of uncertified
rough diamonds. However, arms continued to flow, financed by the unregulated
trade in Liberian timber, which was not affected by any sanctions. A Danish trading
company, however, announced in July that it would stop selling Liberian timber
in Europe.
On August 14, 2001, the U.N.Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination
expressed concern about “reports of extrajudicial killings, allegations of
torture, including rape, and the lack of accountability of perpetrators, including
government security forces, for these abuses.” On August 16, 2001, the U.N. Security
Council publicly stressed “the need for human rights abuses to cease by whatever
parties they are committed” in Liberia. In contrast, the U.N. Office in Liberia
(UNOL) Peace-building Support Office played little or no active role in addressing
the growing repression and abuses in Liberia.
European Union
In July the E.U. agreed to open consultations with the Liberian government
about the worsening situation in human rights, democratic principles, and the rule
of law, citing “serious cases of corruption” as the primary impetus for the move. It
was the first time the commission proposed using articles 96 and 97 of the Cotonou
Agreement signed in Benin in June 2000 by the E.U. and the African, Caribbean,
and Pacific (ACP) nations. The E.U. expressed concerns over a “significantly deteriorated”
political situation, threats to freedom of the press, attacks on human
rights activists, and mismanagement of public funds. In October, European Union
(E.U.) envoy Hans Dahlgren visited Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea to examine
prospects for peace and security in the region, and to formulate an E.U. policy on
the crisis in the region.
The biggest aid donor to Liberia since the civil war ended, the E.U. suspended
approximately U.S. $50 million in aid in 2000 to pressure the Taylor government to
cut its support to RUF rebels. In May 2001, E.U. member states approved a 25-million-
euro (approximately U.S. $22 million) program to assist programs for resettling
refugees and displaced people.
United States
Relations between the U.S. and Liberia further deteriorated as President Taylor’s
role in fueling the war in Sierra Leone became more evident. Following U.N. sanctions
in May, the U.S. prohibited the importation of Liberian rough diamonds.The
Bush administration continued the Clinton policy of isolating Taylor politically
and diplomatically, although the U.S. was less public in its approach. Administration
officials stressed that until Taylor ceased efforts to destabilize the subregion,
including his support for the RUF in Sierra Leone, U.S. policy would remain
unchanged.
After the E.U., the U.S. was Liberia’s largest donor, providing one-third of the
country’s total assistance. From 1997 to 2000, the USAID program focused on the
resettlement of refugees and internally displaced persons and a modest, but less
successful, democracy and governance program. In August, USAID reported that
“the oppressive and irresponsible Charles Taylor government has overshadowed
these achievements and alienated its citizens and the donor community.” The
agency continued to support delivery of food and health care services in 2001, but
planned to put greater emphasis on strengthening civil society.
