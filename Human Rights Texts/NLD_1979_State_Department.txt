 THE NETHERLANDS
 The Netherlands is a parliamentary democracy under a
 constitutional monarchy. It is composed of three
 basic institutions:  (1) the Crown Monarch, Council
 of Ministers, and Council of State);  (2) the
 States General (Parliament); and  (3) the Courts.
 The Dutch observance of internationally recognized
 human rights is based on deep-seated and widely-
 shared concepts of human dignity and respect for
 law. The Netherlands has one of the longest con-
 sistent traditions of respect for human rights in
 the West.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment
 or punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Freedom from denial of fair public trial is guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by
 law and respected in practice.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education.

 The Netherlands enjoys a high per capita income --
 $7,600 -- and is one of the most affluent countries
 in Europe. The Government pursues policies to
 ensure that these benfits are distributed equitably
 throughout the economy. There is a relative
 absence of class distinction. A common educational
 system serves all economic levels. The economy
 remains strongly capitalist, although with substan-
 tial intervention by the government for the purpose
 of redistributing income. Adequate health care and
 shelter are available and are not a problem from
 the standpoint of human rights. Education is
 required up to age 16 and is free to age 18. Cor-
 ruption is unusual and is not a significant impedi-
 ment to the realization of human rights. The
 literacy rate in the Netherlands is estimated to be
 about 97 percent.
 The Government pursues equal rights and even special
 considerations for women, for minority groups anO
 for the economically disadvantaged through legisla-
 tion and effective government procedures to ensure
 compliance. Some minority groups -- particularly
 Moluccans, foreign workers and Surinamers,-- face
 discrimination in regard to employment, housing and
 lack of social acceptance. These problems stem from
 individual attitudes, not from official policy or
 procedures. The Government is taking specific
 measures, such as fair hiring and housing laws, to
 eliminate or reduce such discrimination.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 These freedoms are in effect. There is no system of
 censorship. The press is privately owned and not
 subject to control. The two television channels are
 government-owned and operated on a pattern comparable
 to that found in Great Britain with its BBC. The
 political opposition is alive, well and active;
 criticism of the government is well and frequently
 aired. No journalists have been intimidated or
 imprisoned without due process nor have any news-
 papers been closed except due to bankruptcy. Free-
 dom of religion is a centuries-old, well-established,
 honored and living tradition in the Netherlands.
 No religious groups suffer any form of pressure from
 any source.

 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of domestic and foreign travel,
 and of emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Progress
 Political life is carried out in a highly democratic
 fashion. Legislative power is vested in an assembly
 elected by universal suffrage. Women enjoy the same
 legal protection as men; their participation in the
 social, political and economic life of the country
 is steadily growing at an increasing rate. There
 is substantial but declining discrimination against
 women in hiring, unequal wages, work assignments and
 promotion, as well as in many other sectors of
 society. There is an active trade union movement,
 with nearly a century of tradition, which has the
 legal but seldom exercised right to strike. The
 unions have a well-established and honored right to
 organize and bargain. They also lobby very
 effectively in the Parliament.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The issue of outside investigation has not arisen
 with regard to the Netherlands.
