 SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE
 Sao Tome and Principe, which received its independence
 in July 1975 after five centuries of Portuguese colonial
 rule, is a mini-state with 372 square miles of island
 territory and approximately 75,000 people. The new Gov-
 ernment has instituted a single-party political system
 which protects most internationally recognized human
 rights. The Sao Tomean Constitution pledges the state to
 respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Torture
 There are no reports that torture is used in Sao Tome and
 Principe.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There is no evidence that such treatment or punishment
 occurs.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Sao Tome's Constitution prohibits arDitrary imprisonment,
 and there are no reports that such imprisonment has occur-
 red.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are no reports of fair public trials having been
 denied to citizens of Sao Tome and Principe. In March
 1979, several Sao Tomeans were tried on charges of plot-
 ting against the state. Verdicts ranged from 24 years in
 prison to acquittal. The trial was apparently conducted
 fairly.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 According to limited available information, invasion of
 the home does not occur.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The Government of independent Sao Tome and Principe has
 as a fundamental goal the improvement of the quality of
 life of the population.
 The economy is based on plantation agriculture producing
 cash crops for export. The state's management of the for-
 mer Portuguese-owned plantations is designed to respond
 directly to the needs of those who work on them. After
 a slow beginning, production of the state farms has risen
 somewhat, reflecting the Government's modernization ef-
 orts. In 1978, development expenditures accounted for 74
 percent of the country's total budget.

 International assistance has been sought and received for
 programs to improve education and health care. The total
 development effort is designed primarily to respond to
 the needs of the common citizen. Wealth is generally well
 distributed in Sao Tomean society. There have been no
 flagrant cases of corruption.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 The Constitution guarantees the basic freedoms of religion
 and assembly, but political expression is limited because
 the country has only one political party. The press is
 government-controlled. Assembly for political purposes
 must have the sanction of the ruling party. Women enjoy
 constitutional guarantees of equality with men; many are
 active in public life and several have attained ministe-
 rial rank within the Sao Tomean Government. Labor organ-
 izations are affiliated with Sao Tome and Principe's
 single political party and do not play an independent role
 in the political process.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 The requirement of exit visas and the physical isolation
 of the islands are the only barriers to movement out of
 the country, including emigration. There are, no known
 controls on internal travel.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 All political activity is controlled by the Movement for
 the Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe (MLSTP), the coun-
 try's single party. There is no known discrimination
 within the Party by reason of sex, race, religion, lan-
 guage, or social class. Former members of the now dis-
 banded opposition groups who remain in the country appear
 to suffer no prejudicial treatment at the hands of the
 Government. Several political opponents of the Government
 are in exile, but President Da Costa has announced that
 exiles are free to return whenever they wish.
 The President is elected by the Popular Assembly from a
 list of candidates named by the MLSTP. Under the Con-
 stitution, the Assembly is the supreme organ of the state.
 Legislators are elected for a period of four years by uni-
 versal suffrage. The first post-independence election is
 scheduled to take place in mid-1980.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The Department of State does not know of any requests by
 outside groups to investigate human rights conditions in
 Sao Tome and Principe.
