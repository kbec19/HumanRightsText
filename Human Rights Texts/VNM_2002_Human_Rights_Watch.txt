VIETNAM
The government’s human rights record took several major steps backward
during 2001,with religious rights in particular coming under attack. Security
forces arrested dozens of ethnic minority Montagnards in a heavy-handed response to a popular protest over land rights in the Central Highlands in February.
The authorities detained, arrested or harassed many religious leaders and political
dissidents, including members of the banned Unified Buddhist Church of
Vietnam, the Hoa Hao Buddhist sect, Roman Catholics, retired Communist Party
of Vietnam (CPV) members and military veterans known for their criticism of the
party, and ethnic minority Protestants in the northern and central highlands.
The election of new CPV General Secretary Nong Duc Manh, known as a consensus
builder, at the Ninth Party Congress in April, raised hopes that Vietnam
might step up the pace of reform.These hopes had been largely dashed by October.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
In February 2001, unprecedented mass demonstrations broke out in Gia Lai,
Dak Lak, and Kontum provinces in the Central Highlands. Thousands of indigenous
minority people known collectively as Montagnards, many of them Christians,
gathered to demand greater land rights and religious freedom. In response,
authorities sent troops to the region, and police conducted door-to-door searches
for suspected leaders of the protests, arresting at least twenty in February alone.
Some were beaten, kicked, or shocked with electric truncheons by police officers
upon arrest and during interrogation. In many parts of the highlands, the government
banned gatherings of more than four people, restricted freedom of movement,
and increased its surveillance and harassment of ethnic minority Protestants.
Telephone communication to, from, and within the region was cut off for weeks.
Diplomats and foreign media were barred from visiting the area, other than a government-
sponsored press tour in mid-March and a four-day trip by the U.S.
Ambassador in July.
Fearing arrest, more than 1,000 Montagnards fled to Cambodia. (See Cambodia.)
In September, the People’s Courts in Dak Lak and Gia Lai sentenced fourteen
Montagnards to prison sentences ranging from six to twelve years on charges of disrupting
security brought under article 89 of the Penal Code.At least ten other Montagnards
were sentenced in several district-level trials quietly conducted in Dak Lak
and Gia Lai in October, bringing the total tried as of November to at least twentyfour
people
Human Rights Watch received reports of security forces burning down several
Protestant churches in the Central Highlands. On March 10, heavily-armed police
and soldiers, in full riot gear and carrying electric batons, raided Plei Lao village,
Chu Se district, Gia Lai where several hundred ethnic Jarai villagers were conducting
an all-night prayer meeting. After police officers arrested one young villager, a
crowd gathered and pulled the youth from the police jeep. Police and soldiers fired
tear gas and then bullets into the crowd.Dozens were wounded by shooting or beating,
and at least one villager, Rmah Blin, was killed.The security forces then burned
down the church. As of October, at least four of the dozens arrested were believed
to remain in detention at T-20 prison in Pleiku. In September, Plei Lao villager Siu
Boc was sentenced to eleven years in prison at a trial in Gia Lai. Beginning in June, provincial authorities conducted dozens of ceremonies in the Central Highlands in
which Montagnards who had participated in the February demonstrations were
forced to read confessions about their alleged wrongdoings and renounce Christianity
in front of entire villages, sealing their pledges by mandatory drinking of rice
wine mixed with goat’s blood.
Throughout Vietnam, the government conducted a systematic campaign of
intimidation and surveillance of perceived political opponents.On February 9, academic
Ha Sy Phu was placed under administrative detention for two years in Dalat
for allegedly collaborating with “hostile forces” abroad. That same month democracy
activist Vu Cao Quan was summoned to police headquarters several times
after he organized a meeting in Hai Phong to discuss democratic reforms. On April
24, Vu was arrested and detained for ten days after meeting in Hanoi with other
democracy activists. On April 26, a squad of policemen in Hanoi went to the home
of another well-known dissident,Hoang Minh Chinh, and insisted that he go with
them to police headquarters.Hoang Minh Chinh refused and remained under surveillance
throughout the year.
In June, security police apprehended Vietnam’s most influential dissident, Tran
Do, in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) and confiscated a draft section of his memoirs.
Afterwards, Tran wrote to party leaders and the Vietnam Association ofWriters to
protest the seizure of his writings.
The government stepped up the harassment in September, when fifteen dissidents
were detained in Hanoi, including Pham Que Duong, Hoang Tien, Hoang
Minh Chinh,Tran Van Khue, Nguyen Vu Binh, and Nguyen Thanh Giang. On September
2, just before the detentions, Pham Que Duong and Tran Van Khue had
submitted a request to the government to form an independent anti-corruption
organization. On October 9 Tran Van Khue was officially placed under house arrest
for two years under Administrative Detention Decree 31/CP. In February and again
in June, Pham Que Duong,Hoang Minh Chinh, and Hoang Tien joined more than
a dozen other dissidents in signing joint appeals to CPV officials calling for the
repeal of decree 31/CP,which authorizes detention for up to two years without trial.
Police summoned outspoken Buddhist monk Thich Quang Do, the second
highest-ranking monk in the banned Unified Church of Vietnam (UBCV), for
interrogation several times during the year. On February 4, Thich Quang Do was
detained and searched by security police after visiting UBCV’s Supreme Patriarch,
Thich Huyen Quang, who has been under house arrest in Quang Ngai province
since 1982. In June,Thich Quang Do was placed under administrative detention for
two years at his pagoda after he announced that he intended to escort Thich Huyen
Quang to Ho Chi Minh City for medical treatment. Three other UBCV monks,
Thich Khong Tanh, Thich Quang Hue and Thich Tan An,were also detained at the
same time. On September 2, Ho Tan Anh, a leader of the banned Buddhist Youth
Movement (BYM), which is affiliated with the UBCV, burned himself to death in
Danang, reportedly as an act of protest against religious intolerance in Vietnam.
Afterwards, police searched the homes of several BYM leaders.
As in past years, the government only allowed religious activities by officiallyrecognized
churches and organizations. In April 2001, the State Bureau of Religious
Affairs recognized the Evangelical Church of Vietnam, thus granting legal status to approximately three hundred individual churches in the south but specifically
excluding the much more numerous ethnic minority Protestant house churches.
Christians in ethnic minority areas were suppressed and pressured to renounce
their faith, not only in the Central Highlands but also in the northern provinces of
Lai Chau, Lao Cai and Ha Giang.At least sixteen ethnic Hmong were thought to be
in prison in Lai Chau,Vinh Phuc and Thanh Ha provinces as of October. In April
and June, Ho Chi Minh City police shut down services conducted by outspoken
Mennonite pastor Nguyen Hong Quang, who was beaten and detained on August
17, reportedly for operating a school for children without official permission.
In January, Ha Hai, secretary general of the banned Hoa Hao church, was sentenced
to five years in prison for violating house arrest orders and “abusing democratic
rights.” On March 17, Le Quang Liem, Chairman of the Central Council of
the Hoa Hao Buddhist Church, was arrested in Ho Chi Minh City. Two days later,
Hoa Hao church member Nguyen Thi Thu immolated himself in a protest in Dong
Thap province. Other Hoa Hao members sentenced during the year included Ho
Van Trong and Truong Van Duc.
Despite a visit by a Vatican delegation to Vietnam in June, little progress was
made towards establishing diplomatic ties between Vietnam and the Vatican.Vietnam
continued to insist on having final approval over Catholic religious appointments,
accepting three Vatican-approved bishops in June but rejecting three others.
However, the authorities permitted Catholics to attend an annual celebration mass
at the historic Our Lady of La Vang Church in Quang Tri province. In March,
Catholic Father Nguyen Van Ly was put under house arrest in Hue and denounced
by state media after he submitted written testimony to the U.S. Commission on
International Religious Freedom. On May 17, he was arrested after leading a religious
service at which he allegedly distributed leaflets.He was charged with violating
his house arrest order and inciting public disorder. In October, after a one-day
trial by the People’s Court in Thua Thien-Hue province, he was sentenced to fifteen
years in prison for “undermining the policy of national unity” and violating his
probation order under articles 87 and 269 of the Penal Code. At least three members
of the Catholic Congregation of the Mother Co-Redemptrix, imprisoned in
1987 for holding training courses and distributing religious books, remained in
prison.
Freedom of association continued to be severely restricted, and the formation of
independent associations, trade unions, or nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs) remained prohibited. The government tolerated a number of small gatherings
and “sit-ins” to protest land grabs or corruption. In an unusually large
protest in Hanoi in March ,five hundred ethnic minority people from northern Son
La province gathered outside Ho Chi Minh’s mausoleum in Hanoi to put forward
their side in a land dispute. Police,who allowed representatives of the delegation to
speak with officials,quickly cordoned off the area. Later, as part of security arrangements
for the Ninth Party Congress, the prime minister ordered a clampdown on
public protests in Hanoi.
Strikes,while rare, increased during the year, mostly directed against foreign and
private companies. In the first six months of the year there were more than a dozen
strikes in Ho Chi Minh City against foreign-invested companies. In August, more than four hundred garment workers struck in Ho Chi Minh City to claim unpaid
wages and protest the alleged beating of a pregnant worker at a South Koreanowned
company.
All media remained state-owned and tightly controlled. There were no private
newspapers and television was operated solely by the government. Foreign media
representatives were required to obtain advance authorization from the Foreign
Ministry for all travel outside Hanoi and to clear all interviews with Vietnamese
nationals four days in advance. In July a new media decree, 31/2001/ND-CP, took
effect. It imposed fines for a variety of offenses, including republishing previously
banned stories, intentionally providing false information to the media, and publishing
articles containing pornography or “superstitious attitudes.”
In August, the government passed a decree that imposed stricter regulations on
Internet cafes and imposed fines for illegal Internet usage,while opening up provision
of Internet services to privately-owned businesses, including foreign companies.
The government continued to maintain strict control over the country’s
overall gateway to the Internet by controlling the operation of the sole Internet
access provider. In addition, the government continued to use firewalls to block
access to sites considered objectionable or politically sensitive. In August, Internet
access was terminated in Phu Yen province, on the grounds that it could threaten
national security.
Prison conditions continued to be extremely harsh. Human Rights Watch
received reports of the use of shackles and solitary confinement in cramped, dark
cells, and the beating, kicking, and use of electric shock batons on detainees by
police officers. In June, the official press reported that more than 17 percent of
detainees at Chi Hoa prison in Ho Chi Minh City were held beyond the expiration
of their sentences, including one inmate who was still in detention thirteen years
after his conviction was overturned on appeal.Police officers routinely arrested and
detained suspects without written warrants, and suspects were often held in detention
for as long as a year without being formally charged or tried.Decree 31/CP, the
administrative detention decree, was used on many occasions to place dissidents
under house arrest.
Corruption was identified by the Ninth Party Congress as one of the “four dangers”
facing Vietnam.The Central Committee passed new measures to address corruption
within the CPV, such as requirements for members to reveal their assets. In
July, the Ministry of Public Security proposed to establish a special court to address
corruption, saying it threatened to undermine the CPV’s authority. In September,
six government officials were convicted for corrupt land deals involving the Thang
Long water park. While a businessman convicted in the same case was jailed for
twenty years, the officials were either released or sentenced to prison terms of a year
or less. In mid-November a provincial court opened a trial of twelve people accused
of bribery and embezzling money from government development projects in
northern Lai Chau province, inhabited primarily by low-income ethnic minorities.
The National Assembly appeared to be more assertive than in previous years. In
June, National Assembly members grilled cabinet officials on live television about
their progress on previous policy commitments. That same month the assembly
rejected a law supported by the minister of planning that would have increased the authority of district courts, reportedly because of concerns that the bill would cause
a dramatic increase in the prison population and violations of judicial procedures.
Also in June, assembly members questioned safety plans for the party-approved
Son La dam project as well as the proposed relocation of hundreds of thousands of
people to make way for the dam. Despite the controversy, however, they approved
the project in late June.
In July, Prime Minister Phan Van Khai called for the 1992 constitution to be
amended, reportedly in order to clarify the role of the judiciary, national assembly,
and state bureaucracy, and distribute more decision-making power to local authorities.
A nationwide campaign was announced in August to solicit public opinion on
the proposal, with the caveat that CPV policies be reflected. A clandestine group
called the Vietnam Restoration Party (To Chuc Phuc Hung Vietnam) ignored that
caveat and distributed a letter calling for the repeal of article 4 of the constitution,
which states that the CPV is “the force leading the State and society.”
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
The government did not allow independent associations or human rights
organizations to operate in Vietnam. Contact with international human rights
organizations was strongly discouraged and the government continued to refuse to
permit international human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch and
Amnesty International to conduct official missions to Vietnam. In October Tran
Van Khue, who had proposed to establish an anti-corruption NGO, was placed
under house arrest.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
Vietnam’s increasingly poor human rights record came under international criticism
during the year. The government’s repression of religious leaders and its
crackdown against ethnic minorities in the Central Highlands drew particular fire.
At the annual World Bank-sponsored donor meeting in December 2000,Vietnam’s
donors, while pledging U.S. $2.8 billion in aid, pressed the government to focus
more on environmental issues and good governance, in addition to economic
reforms. In July, the World Bank signed its largest set of loan agreements with Vietnam,
totaling U.S. $520 million, targeted at infrastructure development, economic
growth, and poverty reduction. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) announced
that its Japan Special Fund would provide U.S. $600,000 for secondary education
in rural areas, targeted at ethnic minorities.
United Nations
In August, the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination
(CERD) issued its Concluding Observations on a report, overdue since 1993, submitted
by the Vietnamese government. The committee expressed concerns about religious persecution of ethnic minorities, allegations of forced sterilization of
Montagnard women, and the impact of population transfers to areas inhabited by
indigenous groups. Relations between the Vietnamese government and the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) were often strained during
the year over the fact that thirty-eight Montagnards were resettled to the U.S. in
April, and the UNHCR’s establishment of sites to receive asylum seekers in Cambodia.
In July, talks between UNHCR,Vietnam and Cambodia on the possibility of
voluntary repatriation of Montagnards from Cambodia broke down when Vietnam
refused to grant UNHCR unhindered access to the Central Highlands to monitor
the status of returning asylum seekers. In September, Vietnam ratified two
optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, one on the sale of
children, child prostitution and child pornography, and the other on child soldiers.
Japan
Vietnam’s largest donor, Japan, provided assistance to conduct legal training
programs and reform of the legal system in the specific areas of civil code reform,
drafting of the civil procedure code and criminal procedure code, as well as various
commercial laws.
European Union
The E.U., Vietnam’s second largest donor, was vocal in its support of human
rights. In July, the European Parliament adopted an emergency resolution on religious
freedom in Vietnam and denounced the persecution of several religious leaders
and ethnic minorities in the Central Highlands.That same month E.U. External
Affairs Commissioner Chris Patten raised concerns about religious freedom and
restrictions on international media based in Vietnam in a meeting with the Vietnamese
foreign minister. In talks with CPV Secretary General Nong Duc Manh
during an August visit to Vietnam, the foreign minister of Sweden raised the issue
of human rights and greater freedom of the press, and even broached the topic of a
multiparty system. After an European Commission (EC) meeting in Hanoi in
November, an EC spokesman said that Vietnam had made some progress on
human rights conditions but that it still had a long way to go.
Several E.U. political figures became the subject of controversy after they visited
dissidents in Vietnam. In April,Member of the European Parliament (MEP) Lars
Rise of the Norwegian opposition Christian People’s Party was detained and
deported from Vietnam after visiting several dissidents. In June, Italian MEP
Olivier Dupuis was expelled after he tried to stage a sit-in at the monastery where
Thich Quang Do lives under house arrest.
United States
Relations between the U.S. and Vietnam were strained at times during the year,
but the overall trend was positive.Vietnam reacted defensively,however, to any suggestion
that its human rights record could be improved. Several times during the year the Foreign Ministry charged that the U.S. was inciting unrest in Vietnam and
interfering in its internal affairs, in particular by sponsoring hearings on religious
rights in Vietnam in February and by approving Montagnard resettlement to the
United States.U.S.Ambassador Pete Peterson pressed hard for an official visit to the
troubled Central Highlands after the February unrest.He secured approval only in
July, shortly before he ended his term as ambassador. Peterson was highly critical of
some provincial officials for preventing him from talking freely with villagers.
U.S.Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly, the first senior Bush administration
official to visit Vietnam, made a strong statement criticizing the arrest of Father
Nguyen Van Ly, which occurred during Kelly’s visit in May. The seventh round in
the U.S.-Vietnam human rights dialogue took place in Hanoi in July, with no tangible
results.
In October the Senate passed a resolution approving the Bilateral Trade Agreement
between the U.S. and Vietnam. In September, the House approved the Vietnam
Human Rights Act, which would link future increases in non-humanitarian
aid to progress on human rights. Vietnam reacted strongly against the measure,
issuing public statements from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the mass party
organizations.
Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)
Fellow ASEAN members made virtually no comment on Vietnam’s human
rights record during the year. In July,Hanoi hosted the annual ASEAN ministerial
meetings, the ASEAN Regional Forum, and the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference,
attended by ASEAN members as well as the U.S., E.U., Canada, Japan, and
China.
Vietnam’s relations with neighboring Cambodia were tense at times over the
issue of the Montagnards, especially when Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen
defied his long-time ally by refusing to send the first group of twenty-four Montagnard
asylum seekers back to Vietnam in March. However, the two countries
signed agreements during the year to strengthen border controls, prevent illegal
crossings, and train Cambodian police in Vietnam.
