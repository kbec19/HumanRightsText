RUSSIAN FEDERATION
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
The ongoing conflict in Chechnya and heated debates about press freedom
dominated the year. Forced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial executions
by Russian forces were continuing hallmarks of the Chechnya conflict, while
Chechen rebel fighters increasingly targeted for murder Chechen civilians seen as cooperating with the Russian government.The media landscape in Moscow underwent
major changes as media conglomerate Media Most crumbled. President
Vladimir Putin revived movement on judicial and criminal justice reform, which
had been stalled for years.The proposed reforms, however, did not fully address the
entrenched problems of police torture and prison overcrowding.
The situation in Chechnya remained deadlocked, with more than 75,000 Russian
troops deployed in the republic,unable to root out rebel forces. In January,President
Putin transferred command over the Chechnya operation from the Ministry
of Defense to the Federal Security Service (FSB), and announced a gradual withdrawal
of troops. The withdrawal halted in May after 5,000 troops had left the
republic.
The new military strategy announced by President Putin, involving small operations
against specific rebel leaders, did not affect the conduct of Russian forces
with regard to Chechen civilians. They conducted numerous large-scale and targeted
sweep operations, detaining countless men, often arbitrarily, looting the
homes of civilians, and often wantonly destroying their property. Detainees routinely
faced ill-treatment and torture.Many detainees “disappeared,”with the bodies
of some later discovered in unmarked graves.
The sweep operations in Alkhan-Kala, just southwest of Grozny, were paradigmatic.
During a June 19 to 25 operation, which resulted in the death of notorious
rebel leader Arbi Baraev, federal forces summarily executed at least six men and
detained hundreds, many of whom later reported severe beatings. A sweep in late
April resulted in the “disappearance” of twelve men.
The July sweep operations in the villages of Sernovodsk and Assinovskaia, in
western Chechnya,were of unprecedented harshness. In response to a mine explosion
that killed several policemen, soldiers detained hundreds of villagers, often
without even asking for their identity papers.Many were later severely beaten and
tortured with electroshock.
Russian forces also commonly detained people outside the context of sweep
operations who then “disappeared.” In January, for example, police detained
Zelimkhan Murdalov in Grozny and took him to a local police station.He has since
then been unaccounted for.
In 2001, villagers found numerous unmarked graves containing the corpses of
people last seen in Russian custody.The largest—containing fifty-one bodies—was
discovered near the main Russian military base in February. Law enforcement
agents botched the subsequent investigation. At least sixteen of the people whose
bodies were found there and identified had last been seen in Russian forces’ custody.
Some of the bodies found in this and other unmarked graves showed clear
signs of torture.
Chechen fighters were widely believed to be responsible for a wave of assassinations
of local civil servants and religious leaders who were reportedly targeted for
their cooperation with the Russian government. In 2001, those murdered included
at least eighteen leaders of district and town administrations, at least five religious
leaders and numerous Chechen police officers, teachers, and lower-ranking civil
servants. Several attempts were made on the life of Akhmad Kadyrov, the head of
the pro-Russian administration of Chechnya, and one of his deputies was killed.
On January 9, masked gunmen kidnapped humanitarian aid worker Kenneth
Gluck, of Médécins sans Frontières, on a road near Starye Atagi. Upon his release,
about three weeks later, Gluck’s captors handed him a letter signed by rebel leader
Shamil Basaev calling the kidnapping a “mistake.” On April 18, gunmen in Alkhan-
Kala opened fire on Viktor Popkov, a leading Russian human rights activist.Popkov
died six week later from his wounds. People close to Popkov believe Chechen fighters
were involved in the attack.
About 140,000 internally displaced persons from Chechnya remained in
Ingushetia, many in squalid conditions, despite strong pressure from the federal
government to return to Chechnya. Those interviewed by Human Rights Watch in
July 2001 cited poor security guarantees as the main reason for not returning to
Chechnya.
The Russian government continued to resist a meaningful accountability
process for human rights violations committed in Chechnya, although the number
of investigations rose significantly in 2001. In April, a joint Council of Europe-
Russian Duma working group compiled a list of 358 criminal investigations into
alleged abuses against civilians. But only about 20 percent of the cases were under
active investigation; more than half had been suspended. In “disappearance” cases
as many as 79 percent of the investigations had been suspended. The criminal
investigations list did not include a single case of torture or ill-treatment.Very few
abuse cases had progressed to the courts. Courts issued guilty verdicts against servicemen
in eleven cases, five of which resulted in prison sentences.
The only trial against a high-ranking military official, for the murder of a
Chechen woman in March 2000, seemed set to end in a minimal sentence. In September,
a psychiatric institution found that Col. Yuri Budanov was “emotionally
distressed” at the time he murdered Elza Kungaeva, allowing the charge to be
reduced to manslaughter and opening the way for him to be amnestied. Earlier,
prosecutors had dropped a rape charge despite convincing evidence that she had
been sexually assaulted.
Media freedom continued to be under attack in Chechnya. Several journalists
were briefly detained or punished for their independent reports, and strict limitations
on access to Chechnya for journalists remained in force throughout the year.
On February 21, federal forces detained Anna Politkovskaya of Novaia Gazeta
(The New Gazette) in Khatuni while she was investigating abuses. Russian forces
interrogated her and kept her overnight in a basement on a military base. In
December 2000, a court in Dagestan found Andrei Babitskii, a Radio Liberty correspondent
who had been detained in Grozny in 2000, guilty of carrying a falsified
passport (his captors had not returned his Russian passport) but amnestied him.
The Ministry of Press delivered several warnings of possible sanctions to Moscow
newspapers and the NTV television station for publishing interviews with rebel
leaders.
On November 21, 2000, unidentified gunmen speaking Chechen shot dead freelance
cameraman Adam Tepsurkaev in Alkhan-Kala.Tepsurkaev had shot extensive
footage of Russian soldiers abusing Chechen civilians. Russian soldiers had earlier
detained and tortured Tepsurkaev’s younger brother, demanding that Adam Tepsurkaev
turn himself in to Russian authorities.
In December 2000, Chechen rebels in Georgia’s Pankisi gorge briefly detained three Georgian television journalists on suspicion of cooperating with Russian
intelligence services.
During a year of heated debates about press freedom, the media landscape in
Moscow underwent major changes as media conglomerate Media Most crumbled.
As of this writing, the nationwide broadcast media transmitted a variety of political
views.
At the heart of the debates about press freedom were the stormy and convoluted
events concerning Media Most and its outlets, in particular its television station,
NTV, and radio station, Ekho Moskvy. In April 2001, NTV, the country’s largest
nonstate-owned television station, came under control of Gazprom, a colossal gas
company that is partially owned by the state. The procuracy launched new charges
of financial malfeasance against Media Most owner Vladimir Gusinski, and tried,
unsuccessfully, to secure his extradition from Spain.
Prosecutors questioned several top Media Most officials and detained its financial
director on embezzlement charges. By mid-February, company officials
claimed prosecutors and the tax police had conducted no fewer than thirty raids on
its offices since the investigation into Gusinsky’s affairs began in mid-2000.
Gazprom started its bid to take over NTV when Media Most failed to repay a
loan worth several hundred million U.S.dollars.After months of bitter controversy,
the two sides reached an agreement whereby the gas giant would not obtain a controlling
stake in NTV. However, in early 2001, Gazprom obtained a controlling
stake after all when a court froze part of Media Most’s shares. In April, Gazprom
ousted NTV’s board and appointed its own executive director. Part of the NTV
team left the company in protest. Gazprom also ordered the closure of Media
Most’s flagship newspaper, Sevodnya (Today), and fired the entire editorial team of
its weekly newsmagazine, Itogi (The Results).
As of October 2001, the fate of Russia’s most popular radio station, Ekho
Moskvy, remained undecided. The station’s staff had threatened to resign should
Gazprom obtain a majority stake. Gazprom, which owned a 52 percent stake, had
promised in July to sell 9.5 percent to Ekho Moskvy staff, but by October 2001 the
transaction had not taken place.
While Gazprom had legitimate business interests at stake in Media Most, the
manner it which it gained control over NTV and the vigor and selectivity of law
enforcement agencies’ pursuit of Media Most and its owner strongly suggested a
political motivation for the takeover. Gusinski had been a vociferous opponent of
President Putin.
In Russia’s regions, journalists and media outlets continued to face violent
attacks—the Glasnost Defense Foundation reported that by late May 2001 at least
five journalists had been murdered and thirty-nine violently attacked—but in
many cases it was impossible to determine whether attacks were politically motivated.
Some journalists in the regions faced prosecution for their professional
activities.
In April,police in Belgorod detained journalist and parliamentarian Olga Kitova
on charges of slander. Several months earlier Kitova had published an article in Belgorodskaia
Pravda accusing police officers of torturing several teenagers into confessing
that they had sexually molested a classmate. When police tried to bring
Kitova,who enjoyed immunity as a member of the local parliament, to the precinct for questioning, she resisted and was, as a result, also charged with resisting arrest
and beating police officials. In May, prosecutors released Kitova on her own recognizance.
As of this writing, a local court was examining the case.
The FSB continued to chill freedom of expression and academic freedom by
pursuing espionage cases involving material that defendants claimed was declassified.
In July, military journalist Grigorii Pasko went on trial on espionage charges,
after Russia’s Supreme Court overturned a 1999 ruling by a Vladivostok court
acquitting him. The Vladivostok court had excluded several pieces of evidence, citing
falsification by the FSB. Pasko was accused of passing state secrets on the combat
readiness of the Russian Pacific Fleet to the Japanese media.As of October 2001,
the trial was ongoing.
The trial of Igor Sutyagin, a security and arms control researcher at the U.S.A.
and Canada Institute, continued. The FSB arrested Sutyagin in 1999, charging him
with passing state secrets to two employees of a British consultancy firm.However,
according to his lawyers, Sutyagin never had access to classified materials and had
only collated materials available in the public domain.
The FSB brought espionage charges against academic Valentin Danilov, head of
the Thermo-Physics Center at a university in Krasnoyarsk. Following the scientist’s
arrest on February 16, the FSB charged Danilov with passing to a Chinese company
state secrets relating to satellite technology. In an open letter to the procuracy,
twenty of Danilov’s colleagues maintained the information had been declassified in
1992. Danilov’s trial was expected to start in late 2001.
The espionage conviction of former diplomat Valentin Moiseev also raised fair
trial concerns. The Moscow City Court found Moiseev guilty after erratic court
proceedings in which three different judges started hearing the case before being
removed from it without clear explanation. A fourth judge eventually sentenced
Moiseev to a four-and-a-half-year prison term in August.
In a move that could potentially restrict academic freedom, the presidium of the
Russian Academy of Sciences in June issued a directive ordering research institutes
to exercise “constant control” over scientists’ cooperation with foreigners to avoid
espionage. Although the directive did not contain any provisions that explicitly
restricted academic freedom or freedom of expression, to many, the foregoing espionage
cases indicated that the directive might in practice be applied arbitrarily.
In Moscow, racist attacks by skinheads—extremists known for their shaved
heads and violence—continued to be a serious problem, as did racist police harassment.
Although President Putin sharply and repeatedly condemned racist violence,
his statements were undermined by the absence of efforts to hold police accountable
for their harassment of ethnic minorities.
Police routinely extorted bribes from ethnic minorities, particularly Chechens,
if their victims lacked a propiska, the obligatory residence permit. Police continued
to plant ammunition, explosives, or narcotics on Chechens, often seeking large
bribes in exchange for not pressing charges.
In late October, a group of skinheads stormed a bazaar on the outskirts of
Moscow, killing two vendors from the Caucasus in what appeared to be a racially
motivated attack. Police attributed the violence to “hooliganism” after Spain’s
defeat of Moscow’s soccer team. Skinhead violence erupted in April around Adolf Hitler’s birthday, when a group of about 150 skinheads attacked an Azerbaijani
market in southwestern Moscow and beat many of the vendors. The next day, skinheads
taunted and stabbed to death a young Chechen man in central Moscow.
In August, a group of Russian teenagers, using broken bottles and baseball bats,
attacked six African asylum seekers near an office of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees in Moscow. One of the Africans died of his wounds several
weeks later. A week after the incident, two teenagers warned the U.N. office that
“they would . . . declare a real war against the Africans.”
Russian law enforcement agencies continued to cooperate with Central Asian
governments seeking the extradition of political dissidents in Moscow. In June
2001, police arrested religious dissident Nodir Aliev, who was then extradited to
Uzbekistan and sentenced to a seven-year prison term on charges of “undermining
the constitutional order” of Uzbekistan. Also in June, police detained Tajik journalist
Dodojon Avotulloev on an extradition request from the Tajik government,
which sought to prosecute him for insulting the president of Tajikistan. After a
week of intense international pressure, the Procuracy General denied the extradition
request and released Avotulloev.
For the first time in years, the State Duma seemed set to pass a package of laws
that would reform Russia’s judiciary and criminal justice system.However, the proposed
reforms did not adequately address major rights issues, such as torture and
ill-treatment in police stations, overcrowding in prisons, and state indifference to
domestic violence and rape.
In June, the State Duma passed a draft criminal procedure code in its second
reading, the last step before final adoption. If adopted and signed into law, the code
would introduce some long-awaited changes, such as a transfer from the procuracy
to the judiciary of the authority to approve arrest and search warrants. However,
the draft omitted steps that would help combat torture; for example, detainees
would still require a prosecutor’s consent for a forensic medical examination.Also,
the draft code allowed for law enforcement agencies to seek signed statements from
suspects before explaining their rights to them.
The State Duma also adopted amendments to several laws on the judiciary to
introduce jury trials throughout Russia and to combat corruption among judges.
Under the amendments, jury trials would be introduced in all eighty-nine regions
of Russia by 2003. Draft amendments would also facilitate the prosecution of corrupt
judges. However, some legal experts warned that the amendments made
judges more susceptible to political pressure.
Although Penal Reform International reported that overall numbers of inmates
in Russian prison facilities had decreased, overcrowding in pretrial detention
remained severe.An important initiative that would have relieved overcrowding by
limiting pretrial detention to one year failed, due to resistance from the procuracy.
In the first half of 2001, public officials undermined Russia’s moratorium of the
death penalty.Russia’s justice minister and some members of the State Duma called
for the restoration of capital punishment, and an army general called for the public
executions of Chechen rebel leaders.However,President Putin very firmly spoke
out against the death penalty in July.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
For a second consecutive year, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in April
adopted a resolution expressing grave concern about human rights violations in
Chechnya. The resolution strongly condemned the use of disproportionate force
and serious human rights violations by Russia’s forces. It called on Russia to investigate
all violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, to establish
a national commission of inquiry, and to extend invitations to several U.N.
special mechanisms. Notably, it fell short of calling for an international commission
of inquiry.
At the commission’s September 25 session, U.N. High Commissioner for
Human Rights Mary Robinson spoke about Russia’s noncompliance with the resolution,
specifically its failure to create a national commission of inquiry and to issue
invitations to special mechanisms. The Russian delegation responded that the
Russian Federation does not consider itself bound by the resolution.
In October 2000, the U.N. Human Rights Committee issued its first ruling
against Russia since that country recognized in 1991 the individual right to petition.
It found that Russian citizen Dmitry Gridin’s right to a fair trial had been violated
in his 1990 conviction for rape and murder and urged his immediate release
from prison.
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
On June 15, the OSCE Assistance Group returned to Chechnya, opening its
office in Znamenskoye after working from Moscow for more than two years. The
Assistance Group had received a considerable number of human rights complaints
and worked with the office of the special representative for human rights
in Chechnya, other Russian authorities, and human rights nongovernmental
organizations. The failure by the OSCE to make full use of its human rights mandate
and to commit sufficient staff to the Assistance Group undermined its effectiveness.
Council of Europe
The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe continued to monitor
closely the situation in Chechnya. In January, it restored the Russian delegation’s
suspended voting rights, opting for engagement over exclusion. The assembly
established a joint working group made up of European and Russian parliamentarians
to monitor Russian compliance with Council of Europe requirements. In
April, the joint working group provided the assembly with an exhaustive list of all
investigations into crimes against civilians committed by servicemen and members
of special police forces, an important contribution toward transparency in the
accountability process. In July, assembly president Lord Russell-Johnston expressed
his concern about continuing abuses. In September, the joint working group reported on Russia’s failure to comply with the January assembly resolution and its
dissatisfaction with Russian investigations into alleged abuses.
Council of Europe Human Rights Commissioner Alvaro Gil-Robles visited
Chechnya in February and pressed the Russian government on investigations into
rights abuses.However, he chose not to investigate a mass grave near the Khankala
military base, discovered days before his arrival in Chechnya. He opted instead to
urge the authorities to share information on the investigation with the office of the
president’s representative on human rights in Chechnya.
The secretary general of the Council of Europe,Walter Schwimmer, also repeatedly
criticized the Russian government for the lack of prompt investigations into
human rights abuses in Chechnya.
The Committee for the Prevention of Torture issued a rare public statement
strongly criticizing Russia’s lack of cooperation with the committee’s recommendations.
The statement specifically addressed Russian authorities’ failure to carry
out a thorough and independent inquiry into alleged abuses at the Chernokozovo
detention facility in 2000 and to prosecute cases of ill-treatment of detainees in
Chechnya.
The European Court of Human Rights declared admissible two applications
against Russia for the first time since Russia’s accession to the Council of Europe in
1996.
European Union
The European Union wavered on human rights in Chechnya in 2001. In April,
the European Union tabled a draft resolution on Chechnya at the U.N. Commission
on Human Rights but then tried to negotiate a much weaker chairman’s statement.
When the United States forced a vote on the draft resolution, the European
Union voted in favor.At two E.U.-Russia summits, the European Union reportedly
discussed Chechnya issues behind closed doors, but avoided mentioning them in
public statements.
In December 2000, the European Parliament passed a resolution on the implementation
of the E.U. Common Strategy on Russia. It called for a “double-track”
strategy of collaborating with Russia on strengthening the rule of law and democratic
structures while “whenever necessary, explicitly condemning human rights
violations and the disproportionate use of force, as in the case of Chechnya.”
U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
undermined the European Union’s efforts in Geneva, repeatedly praising President
Putin’s leadership but neglecting publicly to raise abuses in Chechnya, including
Russia’s failure to comply with E.U.-sponsored U.N. resolutions. Following the
September 11 attacks in the United States, Chancellor Schroeder called for a
“reevaluation” of world opinion on the Chechnya conflict.
United States
The Bush administration repeatedly expressed concern over press freedom in
Russia in early 2001 and played a critical role in bringing the Chechnya resolution to a vote the resolution at the Commission on Human Rights in April. However,
once the resolution had passed, the Bush administration missed key opportunities
to press for Russia’s compliance with the resolution’s requirements.
In June, President Bush and President Putin held their first summit in Slovenia
at which Bush declared his support for Putin’s leadership, and forfeited the opportunity
to publicly ask for Russia’s compliance with the U.N. resolution. Subsequent
summits brought no U.S. public criticism of the conduct of the Chechnya campaign.
After the September 11 attacks, the United States actively sought Russia’s support
for its response.While the administration continued public criticism of the
abuses in Chechnya, it did little more to bring Russia to pursue a more vigorous
accountability process.
