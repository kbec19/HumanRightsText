 DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA*
 
 The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which was formed in
 1948 during the Soviet occupation of the northern half of the
 Korean peninsula, is a rigid Communist dictatorship. Although
 some internationally respected human rights are acknowledged by
 the Constitution and laws, individual rights are fully
 subordinated in practice to the ruling Communist Party, with
 its overriding aim of imposing a social revolution and enforcing
 unanimous popular support for the country's governing system
 and its leaders.
 The Government is controlled by the Korean Workers' (Communist)
 Party which, in turn, is under the domination of one man, Kim
 Ii-sung, and his family. The latest Constitution, promulgated
 in 1972, purports to guarantee a wide range of rights,
 including freedom of the press, religion, work, and associa-
 tion, and freedom from sex discrimination. Other provisions of
 that Constitution, as well as the fact of Communist Party
 control, render meaningless most of these guarantees. While
 there were pro forma elections to the Supreme People's Assembly
 in February 1982, and to city and county assemblies in March
 1983, free elections do not exist in North Korea since citizens
 have no choice among candidates.
 Kim Il-sung is committed to reunification of the divided penin-
 sula, by whatever means is necessary. To this end, Pyongyang
 has periodically attempted to destabilize the Republic of Korea,
 for example by the attempt to assassinate the President of the
 Republic of Korea in a bombing attack in Rangoon, Burma on
 October 9, 1983. Four Burmese and 17 South Koreans, including
 four cabinet ministers and a number of senior advisers and
 officials were killed in this North Korean action.
 North Korean leaders justify the regimentation and militariza-
 tion of their society in the name of reunification. The North
 Korean people are subject to rigid controls. Persons who fail
 to cooperate with the regime face imprisonment, confiscation of
 property, or enforced removal to remote villages. Surveillance
 by informers is prevalent. Movement outside one's own village
 requires documented permission. Punishment for "political
 crimes' against the state is severe. Available information
 indicates that the practices of forced relocation of families
 and ideological indoctrination intensified during 1983.
 The state's intervention in the individual's activities in
 North Korea goes well beyond curtailing assembly and expression.
 The authorities attempt to shape the consciousness of the
 populace. Preschool children are drilled in homage to Kim
 Ii-sung and his family, while youths and adults are required to
 participate in daily ideological training conducted by youth
 organizations or at places of employment. The propaganda
 requires rote recitation of party maxims and positions and
 * The United States does not have diplomatic relations with the
 Democratic People's Republic of Korea and thus does not have
 direct access to information on the situation in North Korea.
 Because of the closed nature of the society, there was little
 new information in 1983 on human rights practices in North
 Korea. Much of this report, therefore, is a repeat of previous
 human rights reports and is necessarily based on information
 obtained over a period of time, extending well before 1983.
 While limited in scope and detail, the information is generally
 indicative of the human rights situation in North Korea today.

 strives for ideological purity. The result is that North
 Korea's society is one of the most highly regimented and
 controlled in the world today. At least two North Korean
 security organizations enforce these controls.
 Virtually no outside information other than that approved and
 disseminated by the North Korean authorities is allowed to
 reach the North Korean public. Foreigners who have traveled to
 Pyongyang have been surprised to learn how little the North
 Korean populace knows of the outside world. Senior government
 officials, however, seem to be somewhat better informed.
 North Korea is not the 'classless society' it claims to be.
 Security ratings for each person are based on such considera-
 tions as class origin, ideological fervor and reliability, and
 whether any of his or her relatives or associates collaborated
 with the Japanese occupation of 1910 to 1945 or have attempted
 to defect to other countries.
 These ratings determine access to the better jobs, schools,
 medical facilities, and stores, as well as admission to the
 Korean Workers' Party, the route to the highest levels and
 privileges of the society. Any individual whose relative or
 close family associate has settled in South Korea is treated as
 suspect by the North Korean authorities.
 The Sixth Congress of the Korean Workers Party was held in
 October 1980. This was the first Party Congress to be held in
 a decade. Kim Il-sung was reelected President of the Demo-
 cratic People's Republic of Korea and Secretary General of the
 Party, and his son, Kim Chong-il, effectively was placed in
 position eventually to succeed his father. That Kim Il-sung
 appears thus far able to ensure his succession by his own son
 is indicative of the enormous power concentrated in his hands
 over 36 years. The absence of any evidence of public debate is
 also indicative of the lack of popular participation in the
 political process. The Supreme People's Assembly "unanimously
 endorsed" all the decisions and reports of Kim Il-sung and the
 Political Bureau of the Central Committee without debate or
 dissent. Clearly, Kim Il-sung is attempting to ensure that the
 system he established will endure beyond his lifetime.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 No reliable information is available on politically-motivated
 killing in North Korea. After a careful investigation, the
 Government of Burma determined that the Democratic People's
 Republic of Korea was responsible for the October 9, 1983,
 attempt to assassinate Republic of Korea President Chun Doo
 Hwan during his official visit to Burma. The bomb killed four
 Burmese and 17 Koreans, including four Republic of Korea
 cabinet ministers and a number of senior advisers and
 officials. Two North Korean army officers were brought to
 trial in Rangoon for the attack, and on December 9, 1983, were
 found guilty and sentenced to death.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no information available on disappearances.
 
 
 806
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom House's 1983 report states that "torture is reportedly
 common" in North Korea. The accounts of torture and beatings
 of crew members of the USS Pueblo after their capture in 1968
 are well known and documented. The only other reliable source
 on prison conditions and treatment of prisoners in North Korea
 is Venezuelan poet Ali Lameda, who was detained in North Korea
 from September 1967 through 1974, allegedly for attempted
 sabotage and espionage. While physical torture was not used on
 Mr. Lameda, he stated that Korean prisoners were beaten.
 Lameda noted that "beating was also used as a means of
 persuasion during interrogation.'
 Lameda reported the use of deprivation of food to force 'con-
 fessions," as well as solitary confinement, continuous interro-
 gation, enforced waking periods, poor or nonexistent medical
 treatment, and 12 hours of forced labor per day. In addition,
 prisoners were denied family visits, parcels, correspondence,
 writing materials, newspapers, and clothing changes. Prisoners
 appeared to be regarded as persons without any rights.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention or Exile
 Information on specific criminal justice procedures and prac-
 tices in North Korea is extremely scarce. North Korea has
 refused to permit outside observation of its legal system and
 practices. The accounts provided by the crew members of the
 U.S.S. Pueblo and by Venezuelan poet Ali Lameda, while clearly
 from an earlier period, comprise virtually all the information
 available on the operation of the criminal justice system in
 North Korea.
 North Korean law provides that prisoners may not be held for
 interrogation for more than two months. This period may be
 extended indefinitely, however, if the Interrogation Depart-
 ment obtains approval of the Chief Prosecutor. Lameda, him-
 self, was detained for 12 months without trial or charge. His
 requests for a lawyer of his choice and an open trial were
 ridiculed as "bourgeois.'  Habeas corpus or its equivalent does
 not exist in practice.
 According to newspaper reports, North Korean defectors in South
 Korea estimated in April 1982 that at least 105,000 'ideological
 offenders" were being held in eight major camps in the North.
 Amnesty International has received unconfirmed reports of
 arrests of those opposed to heir apparent Kim Chong-il.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The North Korean Constitution states that courts are indepen-
 dent, and judicial proceedings are to be carried out in strict
 accordance with law. All courts, however, are responsible to
 the people's assemblies, which effectively means total govern-
 mental control of the judiciary. The Constitution also states
 that 'cases are heard in public, and the accused is guaranteed
 the right to defense; hearings may be closed to the public as
 stipulated by law.' Lameda was twice denied public trial.
 After his first arrest he was imprisoned for a year without a
 hearing; after his second arrest, he was tried in a closed
 session without benefit of counsel of his choice, or even
 knowledge of the charges. His tribunal was under the direction
 of the Ministry of Internal Security, with one person serving
 as both judge and prosecutor.
 
 
 807
 Lameda stated that, other than to admit guilt, he was refused
 the right to speak out or defend himself at his trial. His
 'defense counsel" represented him by making a lengthy speech
 praising Kim II-sung and then requesting a 20-year sentence,
 which the tribunal imposed after five minutes of deliberation.
 In a 1979 interview with American journalist John Wallach,
 North Korean Supreme Court Justice Li Chun-uk noted that the
 defense counsel's job is "to give the suspect due punishment.'
 Open court appears to consist of an announcement of the term of
 imprisonment, which has already been determined by the
 Provincial Safety Bureau.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The populace is subjected to continuous indoctrination, designed
 to shape individual consciousness. Preschool children are
 drilled in homage to Kim Il-sung and his family, while youths
 and adults are required to participate in daily ideological
 training conducted by youth organizations or at places of
 employment. The propaganda requires rote recitation of party
 maxims and positions, and strives for ideological purity. At
 least two North Korean security organizations enforce these
 controls.
 Reports, primarily from defectors, indicate that forced reset-
 tlement, particularly for those deemed politically unreliable,
 is common. Permission to reside in, or even enter, Pyongyang
 is strictly controlled.
 According to reports in South Korean journals, Japanese wives
 of Koreans repatriated from Japan since 1959 have not been per-
 mitted to visit Japan and, because their letters are subject to
 strict censorship, many have lost contact with their families.
 Listening to foreign media broadcasts is prohibited and
 violators are subject to severe punishment.
 The Constitution states that *citizens are guaranteed the invio-
 lability of person and residence and the privacy of correspon-
 dence.'  Lameda reported, however, that his residence was not
 respected and that listening devices were used against him. He
 was arrested and his collected papers and poetry destroyed
 without warrant.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution states that "citizens have the freedoms of
 speech, the press, assembly, association, and demonstration.'
 In fact, North Koreans enjoy none of these rights except in
 support of government objectives. Other articles of the
 Constitution which require citizens to follow the "socialist
 norms of life" and to obey a "collective spirit" take prece-
 dence over individual political or civil liberties. Foreign
 and domestic media are censored, and no deviation from the
 official government line is tolerated. Artistic works are
 controlled by the Government and visitors report that a primary
 function of plays, movies, operas, and books is to contribute
 to the cult of personality surrounding 'the great leader," Kim
 Il-sung, and his son, 'the beloved leader,* Kim Chong-il.
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 52
 
 
 808
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government has developed a pervasive system of informers
 throughout the society. No public meetings can be held without
 governmental authorization. Trade unions and professional
 associations exist solely as another method of governmental
 control over their members. They have no effective rights to
 organize, negotiate, or strike.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Constitution guarantees that "citizens have
 religious liberty and the freedom of antireligious propaganda,"
 North Korea, in fact, has severely persecuted Christians and
 Buddhists since the late 1940's. Enforced membership in North
 Korean "religious organizations" is used as a means of identi-
 fying and controlling these groups and individuals. The regime
 uses the remaining organizational facades to proclaim the
 practice of religious freedom but has long since purged the
 membership out of existence. Religious practice is impossible,
 and persons whose family or relatives once had a strong
 religious involvement are discriminated against.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Internal travel in North Korea is strictly controlled. A travel
 pass is required for any movement outside one's home village
 and is granted only for required official or personal travel.
 This requirement is strictly enforced. Foreign travel is
 limited to delegations of officials or trusted artists and
 performers. Emigration is not allowed, and few refugees or
 defectors succeed in fleeing the country. Retaliation report-
 edly is taken against the relatives of those few persons who
 manage to escape. According to Freedom House, "rights to travel
 internally and externally are perhaps the most restricted in
 the world: tourism is unknown--even to communist countries."
 North Korea encourages Korean residents overseas to repatriate
 to "the Fatherland.* Some observers estimate that, since 1959,
 over 100,000 Korean residents of Japan have voluntarily
 repatriated to North Korea. Because of their "corruption" by
 exposure to foreign influences, repatriates are isolated from
 North Korean society after their arrival until they can be
 indoctrinated and their ideological reliability gauged.
 North Korea has permitted some overseas Korean residents to
 return to visit their relatives, and several have made repeat
 visits.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Political processes in North Korea are dominated by Kim Il-sung,
 who leads the Korean Workers' Party, and also heads the Govern-
 ment. Kim has groomed his son Kim Chong-il to succeed him, and
 there are reports that Kim Chong-il has been acquiring increasing
 power and influence. The legislature, the Supreme People's
 Assembly, has never taken any action other than unanimous passage
 of resolutions presented to it by the leadership. In an effort
 to create an appearance of democracy, North Korea has created
 several "minority parties." They exist only as rosters of
 officials who have token representation in the People's Assembly
 and completely support the Government line.
 
 
 809
 Free elections do not exist in North Korea. Although elections
 to the Supreme People's Assembly were held in February 1982, and
 to city and county assemblies in March 1983, in all cases single
 candidates were approved by the Government party in each
 electoral district, and, according to the Government-controlled
 media, 100 percent of the voters turned out to elect 100 percent
 of the approved candidates. Such "elections' in reality are a
 mandatory exercise in which voters are required to participate
 and to approve the party's candidates.
 The average citizen is completely excluded from any meaningful
 participation in the political process. To achieve even a
 semblance of real participation, one must become a member of the
 Korean Workers' Party. The selection process for entrance to the
 party is long and rigorous. Individuals from *bad social back-
 grounds,* i.e., those who have relatives who fled south during
 the Korean war, those whose families had strong religious involve-
 ment or were once property owners or members of the bourgeoisie,
 and those who have relatives who are political prisoners, effec-
 tively are denied entry into the party and are discriminated
 against. Most levels of the party have no voice, serving only to
 carry out the decrees and "on the spot guidance" promulgated by
 the party's leadership, dominated by Kim Il-sung.
 Section 4 Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of. Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No organizations exist within North Korea to report on or observe
 human rights violations. North Korea does not participate in any
 international or regional human rights organizations. On Septem-
 ber 14, 1981, North Korea acceded to the International Covenant
 on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on
 Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. Amnesty International has
 requested a visit to North Korea; the Government has not responded
 to or acknowledged this request. A December 1982 request by
 Amnesty International for information on North Korean laws, on
 use of the death penalty, and on reports of arrests and long term
 imprisonment of political figures also received no reply.
 Amnesty International in its 1983 report on North Korea, which
 covers events during calendar year 1982, continues to express its
 concern about punishment for political offenses. Amnesty Inter-
 national also noted allegations that over 100,000 people were
 held in 're-education" camps, along with reports of arrests of
 persons opposed to the growing political influence of the Presi-
 dent's son Kim Chong-il. Freedom House, in its 1983 report, rates.
 North Korea "not free," places it in the least free category for
 political rights and civil liberties, and describes the country
 as "a hard-line communist dictatorship* in which 'the politburo
 is under one-man rule' and 'individual rights are minimal.*
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 North Korea is a less developed country with a highly centralized,
 planned economy. Many observers believe that, after a period of
 rapid growth in the 1960's and early 1970's, the economy has
 experienced difficulties in recent years largely because of an
 overemphasis on self-sufficiency, centralized planning, heavy
 industrialization, and military expenditures. An estimated
 20 percent of North Korea's Gross National Product consistently
 is committed to military expenditures, the second highest such
 rate in the world. This policy has seriously retarded the
 progress of the civilian economy.
 
 
 810
 The population of North Korea is estimated to be about 19 million,
 with an annual growth rate of 2.3 percent. The 1983 infant
 mortality rate was 31 per 1,000 live births. Life expectancy at
 birth was 65.4 years in 1980. The World Bank estimated in 1977
 that the calorie supply available for consumption was 119 percent
 of nutritional requirements.
 North Korea appears to have invested considerable effort and money
 in developing a comprehensive health care system. Both pre- and
 post-working age citizens are cared for by the state, and their
 basic physical necessities reportedly are provided for satisfac-
 torily. Basic food supplies are heavily subsidized and rationed.
 There have been some reports of reduced rations and food shortages
 in 1983; the proportion of rice in the grain ration has been
 steadily reduced with grains considered less desirable, such as
 millet or barley, being substituted. Reportedly, because food is
 difficult to obtain, jobs in food-handling industries are highly
 prized. Per capita income was estimated to be $968 in 1982.
 The party and government elite enjoy significant economic privi-
 leges, such as access to special stores and medical facilities,
 better housing, and better education, which are not available to
 ordinary citizens.
 The North Korean Government provides 11 years of compulsory free
 education to its citizens and claims to have eliminated illiter-
 acy. The adjusted primary school enrollment ratios for 1976 were
 112 for females and 115 for males, for a combined ratio of 113.
 The Constitution states that "women hold equal social status and
 rights with men.' Despite this provision, few women reach high
 levels of the party or government. Women are represented propor-
 tionally in the labor force, and personnel in small factories are
 predominately women. Reportedly, women are often paid less than
 men for similar work.
