ALGERIA
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Political violence declined overall but continued to claim an average of 125 lives
monthly, most of them civilians. Frequent protests in the Berber-majority Kabylie
region, not all of them peaceful, led to arrests and, at times, harsh repression by the
security forces. Demonstrations and riots erupted frequently in other regions, in
protest of poor living conditions, repression, corruption, and the impunity enjoyed
by security forces, officials, and those with influence. Between March and April,
some fifty prisoners died in a series of uprisings and fires set by inmates of several
prisons protesting against harsh conditions and the jailing of pre-trial defendants
for long periods rather than releasing them on bail.
In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the U.S.,Algeria, in its first
report to the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee, welcomed the new
global efforts as “corroborating its own consistently argued position on the nature
of terrorism . . . ” Algeria, the report stated, had “long suffered the ravages of terrorism,
often in the face of indifference” from the international community.
As in previous years, officials claimed that Algeria’s armed groups were on their
last legs. Army chief-of-staff General Mohamed Lamari told the London-based el-
Moushahid as-Siyassi in June that the number of armed Islamists nationwide had
dropped to seven hundred and that “the end of these criminal groups is imminent.”
Authorities refused, however, to end the ten-year-old state of emergency that
granted the Interior Ministry special powers to forbid public gatherings and detain
individuals without charge.
While security in the major cities had improved, rebel groups that had spurned
President Bouteflika’s 1999 offer of amnesty continued to massacre civilians in
rural areas and smaller cities. These groups were also believed responsible for placing
deadly bombs in public places.The province of Chlef was particularly hard-hit,
with at least 120 persons slain between July and October, including twenty-six in an
August 16 attack and twenty-one on October 24, both in isolated villages. A bomb
blast in a busy market in Larbâa killed thirty-eight persons on July 5. The perpetrators
of such attacks rarely, if ever, provided specific claims of responsibility or justifications for their acts. Active groups included the Armed Islamic Group,
which had for several years been indiscriminately targeting civilians, and the
Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat, which was better known for attacks on
military targets.
There was a noticeable decline in reports of human rights violations committed
by the security forces compared to the mid-1990s.But the pattern of violations suggested
that any decline was caused more by the drop in political violence than by
stronger safeguards against abuse.While there were no new confirmed “disappearance”
cases, police wearing plainclothes continued to arrest young men and hold
them incommunicado beyond the legal twelve-day limit and without informing
their families.While reports of torture were down in absolute numbers, prisoners
were still at high risk of being tortured by their interrogators.
Impunity remained a paramount concern. President Bouteflika pledged more
than once to bring to justice the security force members accused of using excessive
force in putting down Berber protests in 2001, which left more than ninety dead.
The president kept his promise to withdraw some of the controversial gendarme
units stationed in the Kabylie, but little was done to bring offenders to justice. Similarly,
despite pledges by a new presidential human rights commission to resolve the
issue of the “disappeared” by the end of 2002, no progress had been achieved as of
mid-November.
The Berber protest movement focused on demands for recognition of cultural
and linguistic rights, and an end to repressive and corrupt behavior by the security
forces. On the question of regional political autonomy the movement housed
diverse viewpoints.
In elections held May 30, the National Liberation Front, the ruling party during
Algeria’s three decades of one-party rule, captured 199 out of the 389 seats in the
lower house of parliament. Three legal Islamist parties won a total of eighty-two
seats, although the Interior Ministry had disqualified tens of their candidates on the
grounds that they belonged to an “illegal organization,”namely the Front Islamique
du Salut (FIS). (Authorities banned the FIS in 1992 after it performed strongly in
the first round of legislative elections. A military-backed coup canceled the second
round of those elections to prevent the FIS from capturing a parliamentary majority.)
Wafa, a party expected to capture strong support among Islamist voters, could
not participate in 2002, since the Interior Ministry had refused it legal recognition
two years earlier, saying it was too close to the FIS.
During the campaign period, authorities prevented two Berber-dominated
political parties that favored an election boycott from holding rallies and meetings
in public venues, explaining that these were reserved for the parties competing in
the vote. State-controlled television also denied coverage to the pro-boycott movement,
but it covered the range of participating parties and candidates.
In parts of the Kabylie, the vote was marred by acts of intimidation, vandalism,
and disruption committed by activists associated with the pro-boycott Coordination
Inter-Wilaya, a collective of local Berber activist groups and councils in several
provinces. However, the turnout was extremely low even in those parts of the
Kabylie where no disruptions were reported, and reached only two percent for the
region as a whole.
In local elections held October 10, the National Liberation Front, together with
its ally the Democratic National Rally, won control of a majority of town councils
and provincial assemblies. Again, pro-boycott activists in the Kabylie tried to dissuade
voters through acts of intimidation and violence.
In a March 12 speech to the nation, President Bouteflika addressed some Berber
grievances without responding to others. He decreed that Tamazight, the Berber
tongue, would become a “national” language, a concession that fell short of the
demand that it become an “official” language, like Arabic. The president also
announced that twenty-four gendarme agents and five officers had been charged
with homicide or improper use of their firearms for their conduct during the
Kabylie unrest.“The trials will take place in complete openness,”he declared,“without
any ambiguities or aspects left untreated . . . . The state will not yield to
impunity.”However, in the months following this strong statement, it was possible
to verify only two or three cases where security force agents had been bought to
trial. These included the October 29 conviction by a military court of gendarme
Merabet Mestari. Merabet was sentenced to two years in prison for involuntary
homicide in the killing of student Massinissa Guermah, the incident that triggered
months of protests in the Kabylie in 2001. In isolated instances, gendarmes, police,
and members of government-organized civilian defense patrols were prosecuted
for human rights abuses; however, the feared Military Security agency continued to
be above any kind of public accountability for its conduct, notably its torture of suspects
under interrogation.
Both the unrest and the repression in the Kabylie sharpened during March,
despite the president’s speech. There were frequent sit-ins, marches, clashes, and
acts of vandalism against public property. Residents complained of “retaliatory”
and “punitive” raids by security personnel, who ransacked and looted homes, cars,
and businesses, and punched and clubbed passersby in the street. Seven youths died
in various incidents between March 21 and April 1, and scores were seriously
wounded by live and rubber bullets, teargas, and beatings. Authorities arrested
some three hundred people during March, including demonstrators and the leaders
of the protest movement.Many were quickly tried and sentenced to up to two
years in prison on charges such as participating in an illegal gathering, damaging
public property, incitement to riot, blocking traffic, and distributing subversive
tracts. The arrests and trials sparked further sit-ins and rallies to demand their
release. These continued sporadically in the region until President Bouteflika on
August 5 amnestied all those who had been arrested in connection with the protests
in the Kabylie up until that point. However, both the protests and the arrest of
demonstrators and their accused leaders continued after August.
On March 14, police in Algiers forcibly blocked a march called by the Berberbased
Socialist Forces Front, turning back cars with out-of-town license plates and
briefly arresting scores of marchers.Nine months earlier, authorities had banned all
demonstrations in the capital “until further notice.”However, in other parts of the
country, political demonstrations often took place without incident, such as an
April 20 march by some one hundred thousand in Tizi-Ouzou.
On April 2, an uprising in a prison near Constantine resulted in the death of
some twenty inmates in unclear circumstances. Throughout April and early May, prisoners staged disturbances and set fires in several facilities across the country.
Nearly fifty were killed, including about twenty in an April 30 mutiny in Serkadji
prison. Among the leading grievances expressed were the courts’ preference to
detain suspects pending trial and the often-lengthy pre-trial detention that
resulted.Mohand Issad,who headed a presidential commission on judicial reform,
blamed the disturbances also on prison conditions, including “overcrowding . . .
unacceptable food and disastrous medical conditions.” In press interviews in May,
he asked,“When detainees are piled on top of one another in small cells,when juveniles
are next to adult criminals and healthy persons next to sick ones,what should
you expect?” President Bouteflika said on October 30 that authorities had “heard”
the prisoners “cries of distress.” He promised improvements in prison conditions
and urged judges to respect the “exceptional” character of pre-trial detention in
Algerian law.
There was no progress in elucidating the fate of the estimated seven to ten thousand
persons who “disappeared” between 1993 and 1998 at the hands of the security
forces and their paramilitary allies. On October 28,Major General Mohamed
Touati, a presidential advisor, called “disappearances” an “unfortunate and prickly
issue that must be addressed by the governing institutions,” marking the first time
a senior officer of the army had publicly acknowledged the problem.
The president’s National Consultative Commission for the Promotion and Protection
of Human Rights, founded in 2001, told Human Rights Watch on November
6 that it had 4,743 dossiers submitted by families regarding persons presumably
“disappeared” by state agents, and that it continued to receive previously unreported
cases. Commission President Moustapha Farouk Ksentini said he believed
the real total of “disappearances” was “7,000 to 10,000, possibly even 12,000.” In a
June 28 interview with the online journal Algeria Interface, Ksentini said, “The
question of ‘disappearances’must be definitively resolved before the end of the year
. . . . If we reach the conclusion that the State is guilty,we will say so clearly . . . . The
truth must become known, whatever it may be. The honor of the country and its
institutions are at stake. The horrible things from the last few years must never be
repeated.”
Ksentini acknowledged to Human Rights Watch on November 6, however, that
neither the government nor his own commission had thus far satisfactorily elucidated
a single case of “disappearance.”Nevertheless, authorities continued to make
unsubstantiated claims during the year that the government was “clarifying” cases
that families had brought to its attention. On March 10, Justice Minister Ahmed
Ouyahia said on Algerian radio that some six hundred “disappeared” had in fact
joined terrorist groups, out of a total number that he put at 3,200 to 3,300.He did
not elaborate.
While there were no new confirmed cases of persons abducted and “disappeared”
in 2002, security forces continued to make arrests in a manner that violated
Algerian law and that put the detainee at risk of “disappearing.”The arresting force
often wore plain clothes and declined to identify itself. The detainee was then often
held in garde à vue detention beyond the twelve-day legal limit that applies to “terrorism”
and “subversion” cases, although flagrant violations of this law were less
frequent than in the mid-1990s.During garde à vue, relatives were unable to obtain any official information about the person’s whereabouts. For example, ex-prisoner
Omar Toumi of Algiers went on an errand on January 26 and failed to return to his
family.His family contacted the police but received no official confirmation he had
been detained until mid-February. Toumi was eventually brought to court and
charged with security offenses. Omar’s brother Saïd has been “disappeared” since
being arrested in 1994 at his workplace by armed men, some of them in uniform.
Persons taken into detention, whether for security or common criminal
offenses, were at risk of being tortured by their interrogators. Beatings and the
“chiffon”—placing a rag soaked in dirty water or household chemicals over the
nose and mouth to induce choking—were the most commonly reported torture
methods. The use of electric shocks was also reported on occasion in different
detention centers.Ahmed Ouali and his father Mohamed and uncle Fouad were all
arrested on January 12 near their homes in el-Harrach and brought to a detention
center run by the Military Security agency.The three later told defense lawyer Mahmoud
Khelili that their interrogators subjected Ahmed, a former FIS activist, to the
“chiffon” and electric shocks and bound him by a rope suspended from the ceiling.
Fouad suffered similar mistreatment. The two brothers were charged with membership
in a terrorist organization and placed in pre-trial detention. Mohamed,
who was beaten during interrogation, was released without charge.
Hoceine Rachdi of Relizane was arrested on October 2 and tortured by agents of
the Military Security who applied electric shocks to his ears, according to a relative
interviewed by Human Rights Watch. The relative said that family members could
still see traces of torture on Hoceine’s face and hands during an October 14 visit
with the prisoner, who was being held on suspicion of aiding a terrorist organization.
Boubaker Kamaz, a former security prisoner who lives in Constantine, was
arrested January 9. Kamaz told his lawyer that during his fourteen days in incommunicado
detention—two days longer than the legal limit—he was chained to a
chair, beaten, whipped, and gagged with a “chiffon.” The investigating judge
rejected his demand for a medical examination, a decision that was reversed on
appeal.When a doctor finally saw Kamaz on May 2, nearly four months after the
abuse occurred, he noted scratches from the wrist and ankle restraints. In a rare
departure from the usual practice, the trial judge on October 20 acquitted Kamaz
on charges of belonging to a terrorist group, apparently after accepting the medical
report as grounds for doubting the evidentiary value of Kamaz’s confession.
State-controlled television and radio remained government mouthpieces,
ignoring or downplaying major demonstrations and massacres that were covered
on locally available European and Arab stations. A bright spot was the live broadcasting
of sessions of parliament. Private newspapers, in spite of repressive press
laws, often criticized government actions, publishing eyewitness accounts of the
gendarmerie’s suppression of demonstrations, and accusing officials and state
institutions of corruption, nepotism, and incompetence. They exercised more selfcensorship
concerning the army’s role in politics.
A number of reporters, cartoonists, and editors at Algeria’s private daily newspapers
were summoned for questioning by the police or investigating judges in
response to complaints filed by the Defense Ministry regarding published articles and political cartoons. Those who were charged risked the longer jail terms and
larger fines provided by the 2001 amendments to laws on libel. However, journalists
who were sentenced to prison terms during 2002 appealed their convictions
and none was actually incarcerated during the first ten months of the year.
Khaled Nezzar,Algeria’s defense minister from 1990 to 1993, sued ex-army officer
Habib Souaïdia for libel in a Paris court for having declared on French television
that Algeria’s “generals” had killed “thousands of people” during the political
violence of the 1990s. Souaïdia is author of a book on Algerian army abuses entitled
The Dirty War, published in 2001 in France, where he resides. The weeklong
trial in July featured some thirty witnesses, including persons tortured by the security
forces and relatives of persons murdered by armed groups. The court ruled in
September against the plaintiff, saying that history, rather than the court, was a better
venue to resolve the dispute.
In separate cases, French courts also dismissed complaints against Nezzar filed
by torture victims who claimed that Nezzar bore command responsibility for the
torture they allegedly suffered at the hands of his subordinates. The French courts
decided to close the cases after Nezzar submitted in April to questioning by police
who were investigating the complaints. The court ruling was based on the grounds
that the evidence directly linking the ex-minister to acts of torture was not sufficiently
compelling. In Algeria, meanwhile, a court on April 30 sentenced Souaïdia
in absentia to twenty years in prison for having said in a press interview that he had
been in touch with a dissident group of ex-officers in exile and if there were a revolt
against Algeria’s rulers he would come back “to take up arms against the generals.”
The new government formed after the May legislative elections included five
women ministers, including the renowned women’s rights activist Khalida Messaoudi
as spokesperson. However, there was no progress made during the year
toward modifying the 1984 Family Code, which grants women inferior rights in
divorce, inheritance, custody of children, and other matters.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Human rights defenders collected and published information openly in major
Algerian cities.However, their work was hampered by selective acts of harassment
and prosecution and by the fear of many victims and witnesses to come forward to
provide testimony.
Mohamed Smaïn, spokesperson for the Algerian League for the Defense of
Human Rights (Ligue Algérienne de défense des droits de l’Homme, LADDH) in
the western city of Relizane, was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine by a
court of appeals on February 24 on charges of libeling a former mayor, el-Hadj Fergane,
and members of an armed self-defense group he headed. Smaïn had long
accused Fergane and his colleagues of carrying out “disappearances” and assassinations
in the region during the mid-1990s. In February 2001, Smaïn had alerted the
press to an earth-digging operation, at which Fergane was allegedly present, to
transfer the contents of a mass grave near Relizane to another location. Smaïn was
free pending his appeal of the verdict to the Supreme Court, which had not ruled by the time this report went to press. In September, Smaïn’s passport and driver’s
license, confiscated in 2001, were returned to him. Repeated efforts by Human
Rights Watch while in Relizane in November to obtain comment from Fergane
were unsuccessful.
Organizations built around relatives of “disappeared”persons continued to collect
previously unreported cases from 1993 to 1998. They held regular sit-ins in
Algiers, Oran, Relizane, and Constantine to demand the return of their relatives or
information about their fates.These were tolerated on some occasions and forcibly
dispersed on others. On March 18, police dispersed relatives of the “disappeared”
who were attempting to gather in front of the United Nations office in Algiers and
arrested Abderrahmane Khelil, an activist with the LADDH and SOS-Disparus, an
advocacy group launched by relatives of the “disappeared.” He was released without
charge after a few hours. Police also used force to break up sit-ins by relatives of
the “disappeared” before the headquarters of the president’s human rights commission
on June 23 and July 3, and to turn back a march of some fifty relatives
toward the president’s office on November 6.
Khelil and a friend, Sid Ahmed Mourad,were arrested on May 19 near an Algiers
university campus where they had gone on behalf of the LADDH to investigate the
arrest of students the day before. They were jailed until May 26, when a court gave
them a six-month suspended sentence for “inciting an unarmed demonstration,”
even though they had not arrived at the scene of the demonstration in question
until the following day.
Foreign human rights organizations continued to receive visas selectively and
sporadically. Between February 2001 and August 2002, no request to conduct missions
from Human Rights Watch,Amnesty International, the International Federation
of Human Rights, or Reporters without Borders was approved.However, the
organizations were able, on occasion, to send researchers and trial observers when
they needed no entry visa due to their nationalities. In September 2002, both
Human Rights Watch and Reporters without Borders received entry visas for the
first time since May 2000 and January 2001, respectively, and both organizations
carried out research missions in October.
Algeria continued its refusal to grant long-standing mission requests from the
U.N. special rapporteurs on torture and on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary
executions, and did not accept a request for an invitation from the Working Group
on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances. However, it allowed a visit in September
by the rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) continued its program
of visiting inmates in prisons administered by the Justice Ministry, and opened an
office in the capital. The organization was permitted also to visit prisoners in garde
à vue detention in police stations. However, detainees held in facilities run by the
military—where the most severe abuses were thought to take place—remained offlimits.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
European Union
The government of Algeria made progress in rehabilitating its image internationally
in late 2001 and in 2002. An overall drop in political violence, President
Bouteflika’s offer of partial amnesty to the rebels, and his strong anti-terror position
following the September 11, 2001 attack on the United States helped to upstage
human rights concerns that had kept many Western governments from deepening
relations with Algiers.
The president met with President Bush twice during 2001. On November 30 of
that year, he hosted Jacques Chirac in the first visit by a French head of state since
1988. One month later he was in Brussels for the initialing of an Association Agreement
with the European Union.
Europe remained the chief source of Algeria’s imports and the main consumer
of its exports, mostly natural gas and oil. France was the state most influential in
shaping E.U. policy toward Algeria. It was also the leading source of Algeria’s
imports and home to the largest Algerian community outside Algeria.
The E.U.-Algeria Association Agreement was formally signed on April 22, after
four years of mostly stalled negotiations. It focused on tariff reductions, but also
included an article that called “respect for human rights” an “essential element” of
the agreement; this article was common to the E.U.’s agreements with its Euro-
Mediterranean partners.The Algeria pact won the European Parliament’s endorsement
on October 10, but before taking effect it had still to be approved by the
national parliaments of Algeria and the E.U. member states.
The E.U. was quieter on human rights issues than in 2001,when the outbreak of
unrest in the Kabylie prompted a more vocal response. The E.U.’s constituent bodies
made no comment on the legislative elections held on May 30.But on June 5, on
the occasion of the first of the twice-yearly meetings between Algerian officials and
the E.U. “troika,” Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Pique, the delegation head, said
the troika had noted a “clear improvement” in respect for democracy and human
rights.He provided no specifics.
Pique added that the delegation had raised the issue of “disappearances,” but he
did not disclose whether headway was made on the issue. Officials of the European
Commission told Human Rights Watch that the troika had requested, at each bilateral
meeting since 1999, concrete information on a regularly updated list of some
thirty “disappearance” cases, but, as of October 2002, had yet to receive from Algerian
authorities verifiable information on the whereabouts or status of any of those
cases.
The Algeria Strategy Paper under the Euro-Med Partnership for 2002-2006
identified “consolidation of the rule of law and good governance” as one focus of
E.U. assistance. In January, the European Commission signed a contract to disburse
Û8.2 million over six years for police reform, and also provided aid to a variety of
nongovernmental organizations and independent media.However, the E.U.’s program
hit a rough spot in January 2002, when Algerian authorities denied visas to
two commission officials who were about to conduct a technical mission to Algeria to assess potential partners within civil society.Algeria,which stated that it had not
been duly consulted in advance of the mission, subsequently issued visas and the
mission took place in April.
When giving its assent to the Association Agreement, the European Parliament
overwhelmingly adopted a strong ancillary resolution identifying “points of reference
for assessing compliance with the human rights clause” of the pact. These
goals included resolving the problem of the “disappeared,” “ending all forms of
impunity,”“guarantee[ing] a truly independent justice system,”and allowing access
for U.N. rapporteurs and human rights organizations.
United States
The U.S. and Algeria drew closer during 2001 and 2002, a result of increased
cooperation in fighting terrorism, growing bilateral trade, and U.S. private investment
in Algeria, mostly in the hydrocarbon sector.
While U.S. direct aid to Algeria remained minimal, the two countries engaged in
a fourth round of joint naval exercises in January and several senior U.S. officials
traveled to Algeria following President Bouteflika’s two meetings with President
Bush in 2001. In December of that year, Undersecretary of State William J. Burns
met with President Bouteflika; a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) delegation
came in February to discuss security cooperation.Despite these opportunities,U.S.
officials did not publicly raise human rights concerns.Criticism,when it came, was
mild. Burns, speaking in Washington on January 30, cautioned all the Maghreb
countries about “heavy-handed governance that aims to suppress dissent, but often
has the effect of prolonging it.” State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
commented on May 30, “We have seen progress in Algeria toward greater democracy,
and we urge President Bouteflika and his government to continue efforts to
improve and strengthen freedom of expression, responsive government, and a
transparent political process.”
But the tenor of relations during 2002 was revealed more by the Department of
State’s counter-terrorism chief Francis X. Taylor, who declared upon his arrival in
Algiers on June 27,“Algeria is one of the most tenacious and faithful partners of the
United States . . . . Algeria has cooperated with us in every domain.” Under Secretary
of State Marc Grossman visited Algiers on November 6 and said in a press conference
that the U.S. was supporting Algeria’s fight against terrorism “with some
joint training and also with other help that we can provide.”Grossman met that day
with Prime Minister Ali Benflis and Foreign Minister Abdelaziz Belkhadem. There
was no public indication that he raised human rights issues in those discussions;
however, in his press conference Grossman said the U.S. was prepared to help train
Algerian judges so that they would be “independent . . . courageous . . . [and] make
decisions on the basis of the law.”
The only forceful public comment made by the U.S. on the subject of human
rights in Algeria remained the annual country reports on human rights practices,
released in March. The U.S. Agency for International Development funded some
training programs for human rights and other civil society organizations.The State
Department’s Democracy Commission Small Grants Program awarded $18,000 to three human rights groups to organize a conference on the “disappeared.” The
National Endowment for Democracy, a congressionally funded private foundation,
also provided grants to independent human rights groups.
On March 27, the State Department added the Salafist Group for Preaching and
Combat to its list of foreign terrorist organizations, a designation it had already
given to the Armed Islamic Group.
The U.S.-government-run Export-Import Bank, which provided loans and
guarantees to assist U.S. investment abroad, had an exposure in Algeria on September
30 of U.S. $1.84 billion, second in the region only to the bank’s exposure in
Saudi Arabia of $1.88 billion.
The U.S. shifted its policy in favor of licensing private sales of night-vision
equipment for counter-insurgency use by the Algerian government, according to
various press reports published since late 2001. The equipment had been among
the nonlethal materiel the U.S. had previously declined to license because of concerns
about the human rights practices of the government. The State Department
declined to comment when Human Rights Watch sought confirmation of this
reported change in policy.
