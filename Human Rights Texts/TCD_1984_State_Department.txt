 CHAD
 Chad is governed by an authoritarian regime dominated by
 President El Hadj Hissein Habre, who came to power in 1982.
 He heads a French-style Council of Ministers which, along with
 an appointed National Consultative Council, comprises the
 executive and legislative branches of the Government.
 President Habre established in 1984 a single-party
 heterogenous political organization, the National Union for
 Independence and Revolution, to attract wider multi-ethnic
 representation. Chad has been in a state of civil strife
 since 1965, with various factions and as many as 11 different
 armies, contending for control of the country. During the
 prolonged civil war, institutions that might be expected to
 provide for the protection of human rights, such as the
 judiciary, largely disintegrated.
 The northern third of Chad was under military occupation in
 1984 oy an estimated 5,000 Libyan troops and some 6,000
 Libyan-supported rebel forces, headed by ex-President Goukouni
 Oueddei. Elsewhere, southern insurgents increased operations
 throughout parts of central and southern Chad against military
 and civilian targets. Together with government reprisals,
 this action created a cycle of escalating violence and human
 rights violations. Owing to indiscipline, government and
 rebel forces alike committed arson, rape, robbery, and summary
 executions.
 In 1984 Libya concluded but did not honor an agreement with
 France for mutual military withdrawal from Chad. Since
 occupied Chad was closed to outside observers, it is difficult
 to document human rights abuses in the north, but reports
 suggest a record of massive violations by the Libyans. In
 this desert region they banned Chadian customs as well as the
 French language, and Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Qadhafi
 tried to inculcate his social-political philosophy. Libya
 also continued to funnel materiel and money to the insurgents
 in southern Chad throughout the year. The southern
 insurgents' unwillingness to resolve their differences with
 the Government reflects the difficulty of getting the
 country's diverse ethnic and religious groups to make common
 cause. This report addresses human rights concerns in both
 occupied and unoccupied areas.
 Despite military action on several fronts, the Habre
 Government took some important steps in 1984. It cooperated
 with the International Committee of the Red Cross in March to
 ensure prisoners of war better treatment. It amnestied 150
 political prisoners on May 19. It returned to Sudan in
 September 121 Sudanese mercenaries held as prisoners of war.
 It is pursuing an accommodation with dissidents in exile, whom
 it hopes to integrate into Chad's sole political party.
 Despite the lack of success in 1984, the Government is
 attempting to come to terms with the dissidents in southern
 Chad and to integrate them into the Chadian national armed
 forces. Moreover, it strengthened Chad's judicial
 administration by naming additional judges. If Libya would
 nonor its mutual troop withdrawal agreement with France,
 prospects for national reconciliation and the human rights
 situation would be enhanced.
 Chad's five million people remain extremely poor. About 90
 percent of the population are semi-nomadic or in subsistence
 agriculture. The country derives its foreign exchange and
 much of its national income from the sale of cotton and

 livestocK; the modern monetized economy involves essentially
 only the small minority of people in Chad's four cities or
 their environs. Apart from the capital city of N'Djamena,
 much of Cnad's agricultural and industrial activity occurs in
 the south. The insurgency there impedes economic growth,
 exacerbating the lack of investment capital and the effects of
 a drought of historic proportions.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The continuing war with Libya and the southern insurgency and
 the Government's efforts to combat it have all led to killings
 for political reasons. In southern Chad, the claims and
 counterclaims of arbitrary executions by government and rebel
 forces make an exact rendering of the number of political
 killings impossible.
 One of the dissident groups, the "Organization for the
 Liberation of Chad from Imperialism and Fascism,* claimed
 responsibility for the assassination of nine Chadian and three
 Zairian soldiers between February 9 and March 11. On March
 10, a commercial airliner was blown up on the ground at
 N'Djamena airport by an unknown opposition group, injuring 28
 persons and killing one. An insurgent group charged in April
 that government forces had killed 90 civilians and wounded
 another 70 in the Beinamar/Laramanaye regions of southern Chad
 during the last 2 weeks of February, but other sources suggest
 the number killed and wounded was substantially less.
 Lncreased insurgency in August, September, and October
 resulted in perhaps a dozen summary executions of southerners
 suspected of supporting the rebel forces. Thirty to 40
 innocent civilians may have been killed in the crossfire of
 skirmishes between government and rebel forces. In reprisal
 for attacks by rebels, government forces are known to have
 burned several southern villages, causing the death of an
 unknown number of civilians. The rebels are reported to have
 assassinated several southerners who supported the Government.
 The Libyan occupation of northern Chad was marked by alleged
 executions of an unknown number of political opponents during
 much of the year. Several Chadians, who once supported rebel
 forces in the occupied zone, have asserted that Libyan troops
 had indiscriminately killed many Chadians fleeing south in
 1984.
 b. Disappearance
 Against the backdrop of increasing violence, there were a
 number of reports of disappearances in all areas: of Chadians
 who refused to collaborate with insurgents in southern Chad;
 of several persons detained by the Government for suspected
 symphathy with rebel forces, including two seriously wounded
 rebel soldiers; and of Chadians in occupied Chad who refused
 to collaborate with the Libyans. Rebel forces in the north
 abducted two Belgians (employed by the non-governmental
 organization, Doctors without Frontiers) on January 24 in the
 course of a raid against a government outpost. Upon their
 release in Tripoli, Libya, on April 2, a spokesman for the
 
 
 CHAD
 rebel group warned humanitarian organizations to abstain from
 helping *the enemy" or risk having their personnel treated as
 mercenaries.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Reports indicate that incidents of torture occurred during
 1984. One person who claimed to have been incarcerated in a
 detention center at the Chadian Presidency (*Les Jardins'),
 alleged hearing screams of pain there. Rebel prisoners
 interviewed by French journalists in late September stated
 that they had been harshly treated by the Government and that
 about 50 had died of torture or hunger. However, they also
 confirmed that conditions improved after the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) took responsibility for
 their welfare in March. One former prisoner asserted that
 some prisoners who had not had ICRC attention slowly starved
 because they had no family to provide them with food and the
 Government claimed it did not have the resources to do so. In
 the countryside, government forces have been accused of arson
 and rape, and of lesser humiliations of persons thought to be
 sympathetic to rebel forces. The Government has acknowledged
 these abuses and in some cases disciplined the soldiers and
 officials responsible. Rebels in southern Chad have maimed
 peasants who have refused to cooperate with them. In the
 north, reports indicate that the occupation forces deprived
 detainees of food, water, and medicine, and used other forms
 of torture in consolidating control.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In non-occupied Chad a well-developed criminal code has
 evolved from the corpus of law inherited from France. No
 analogous code of law governs the detention of persons thought
 to be endangering the security of the state. A majority of
 the detainees in Chad are persons captured in combat or
 counterinsurgency operations. Few, if any, of them have been
 charged with treason or espionage by an independent
 judiciary. The Government has detained without warrant about
 1,000 persons for political opposition. Such persons were
 among the 150 political detainees amnestied on May 19. The
 Government of Chad stated that El Hadj Ali Mohammed, an Imam
 at Abeche, is now free; Amnesty International was concerned
 that he had been detained without charge.
 Libyan occupation forces allegedly deported about 1,200 young
 Chadian women and girls to Libya between July 1983 and March
 1984. During the same period, some 2,000 males between the
 ages of 14 and 40 were reportedly impressed into the Islamic
 Legion, a Libyan-organized mercenary force.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Chad's criminal code prohibits unjustified police arrests and
 sets out clearly the rights and responsibilities of detainees,
 prosecutors, and magistrates. The code also ensures a
 detainee's right to be represented by counsel and to be
 charged or released within a specified period of time, or to
 be informed of the charges against him which warrant
 preventive detention. These rights were particularly
 neglected during 1978-1982, at the height of the civil war.
 The Government has increased the number of judges, and lately
 investigating magistrates are applying these provisions of the

 CHAD
 freedom of association, and employment discrimination.
 Concern was also expressed that provisions of Chadian law
 appeared to violate these conventions. In 1984 the Committee
 noted the serious problems faced by Chad in fulfilling its
 obligations and called for ILO assistance to the Government.
 In the Libyan/rebel-occupied area of northern Chad, indigenous
 Chadians were prevented from gathering in groups numbering
 more than three persons in the large oases of Faya Largeau and
 Fada during at least part of the year.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam, Christianity, and animism are freely practiced. The
 country has remained multi-religious despite domestic and
 fureign pressures in favor of Islam. More than 50 percent of
 Chad's population profess faith in Islam, and the percentage
 is growing. Recently several high-level Chadian officials
 have said that Catholic priests in southern Chad are abetting
 tne insurgents. Yet there is no information to suggest that
 the practice of Christianity or animism is a bar to
 advancement in government service. The Libyans limit
 religious practice in the occupied zone, in keeping with
 Colonel Qadhafi's view of his mission to spread Islam.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The movement of persons throughout Chad continues to be
 circumscribed by the insurgency and occupation. The Libyan
 occupation of northern Chad compelled some 80,000 persons to
 relocate elsewhere in Chad. Chadians remaining in the
 occupied zone could move from one area to another only if they
 possessed passes issued by Libyan officials. Unconfirmed
 reports indicate that up to 40,000 Chadians sought refuge in
 the Central African Republic and 110,000 in Sudan, owing to
 the combined effects of drought and insurgency. The increased
 violence in southern Chad during the last half of 1984
 reversed the flow of refugees returning to Chad. In the south
 travel has been further impeded by roadblocks set up by
 government forces and by rebel ambushes. International travel
 is permitted. Chadians may obtain regular passports by paying
 about S42, provided they have been cleared by Chad's internal
 security services; and regulations call for these
 investigations normally to be completed within a week. There
 are no known instances of the denial of a passport or laissez-
 passer for political reasons. The Government announced that
 all Chadians in exile are free to return to Chad.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The present political system does not allow for change of
 government by the people. Chad continues to be governed by
 President El Hadj Hissein Habre who heads a French-style
 Council of Ministers complemented by an appointed National
 Consultative Council. Both councils are carefully balanced
 ethnically and regionally. President Habre draws his
 authority from the allegiance of a large part of the armed
 forces and tue security services of the country's sole
 political party, the National Union for Independence and
 Revolution. Created in June 1984, the party embraces a much
 wider ethnic representation than did its predecessor, the
 Command Council of the Northern Armed Forces, and its
 
 
 CHAD
 establishment was intended as a step toward the participation
 of a larger number of Chadians in the country's political
 life. President Habre plans eventually to enlarge the party's
 executive structures in order to accommodate Chadians in
 exile. The party's by-laws mandate the popular election of
 lower-level officials who, in turn, will vote for party
 officers at the level immediately above. No elections have
 yet been scheduled. At present, laws, decrees, and ordinances
 are decided jointly only by the President and the Council of
 Ministers.
 In the occupied zone, Libyan military and civilian officials
 have obliged Chadians to establish "people's committees'
 modeled on those in Libya. The leadership of the rebel
 "Transitional Government of National Unity" (GUNT) is Chadian;
 its head is former president Goukouni Oueddei. GUNT
 represents various factions indebted to Libya.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Amnesty International in its 1984 report (covering 1983)
 expressed concern about alleged extrajudicial executions and
 the detention without trial of real or suspected political
 opponents of the Habre Government. Amnesty International also
 reported in 1984 on violations in the south, including summary
 executions by government forces. In November 1984, the
 Government sharply criticized Amnesty International and said
 attention should be focused on the root cause of the
 situation, the Libyan occupation. In the occupied zone,
 Amnesty International has not been permitted to probe into
 alleged violations of human rights. Nevertheless, it has
 reportedly charged the Libyan authorities with implementing
 summary justice and executions.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) suspended
 its operations in the occupied zone in May owing to its
 inability to visit government troops held prisoner by rebel
 and Libyan forces. In unoccupied Chad, the ICRC has been
 operating with minimal restrictions since March. The League
 of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the Chadian
 National Red Cross continue to provide large quantities of
 food and medicine to Chadians who have been affected by an
 unprecedented drought. Freedom House rates Chad "not free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Civil strife has ravaged much of Chad in the last 19 years,
 but continuing drought and increasing desertification have
 exacerbated the decline in national output in the last year.
 The typical Chadian lives in a pre-industrial and pastoral
 economy, and the per capita GNP of $78 (1982) will undoubtedly
 be reduced further next year because of persisting unfavorable
 climatic conditions. Throughout much of 1984, France's 3,000
 troops in Chad buoyed up small-scale commercial activities and
 private investment, but their departure under the Franco-
 Libyan troop withdrawal accord will depress economic growth.
 Mortality and longevity rates, like national income data, show
 that Chad's population of about 5 million people ranks among
 tne world's most underprivileged. World Bank data for 1984
 indicate that life expectancy at birth is 44.1 years and
 infant mortality is 141.9 per 1,000 live births. However,
 
 
 CHAD
 other figures suggest average life expectancy lies in the
 range of 40-43 years and the infant mortality rate between 150
 and 210 per 1,000 live births. The Ministry of Health
 estimates that there are only 20-30 Chadian physicians in the
 entire country, and perhaps another 75 physicians are
 affiliated with non-governmental organizations; goverment per
 capita health expenditure ($0.90) is also one of the lowest in
 the world. It is certain that the typical Chadian now
 satisfies much less than the 74 percent of the suggested
 caloric requirement that was recorded in 1977, a year
 considered good by current standards. An ever-increasing
 number of Chadians depend on international food aid to keep
 alive. Up to 3,000 people died of starvation in 1984. No
 more than 26 percent of the population had access to safe
 drinking water in 1975, the last year for which reliable data
 are available. Only 20 percent of the population is
 functionally literate, and in 1976 primary school enrollment
 was only about 34 percent of the primary school-age
 population. Despite the hostilities, most of the educational
 institutions in unoccupied Chad are now being operated in some
 way after being closed for five years.
 Women are generally subordinate to men in Chadian society.
 Girls do attend school at all levels of the educational
 system. Some women participate in the political life of the
 country as, for example, the Minister of Social and Women's
 Affairs, who is also a member of the party's Executive
 Committee. Some women serve voluntarily in the armed forces,
 and some figure prominently in the labor movement. Although
 figures are not known, many women and their children have been
 left homeless and without adequate means of support, with
 their husbands missing or dead in civil strife. Widows and
 orphans are, however, often taken care of by members of the
 extended family.
 Economic and demographic data pertaining to occupied Chad are
 not available. Much of the northern desert economy was
 damaged by intense Libyan bombing in 1983. Several reports
 indicate that sizable quantities of livestock were shipped to
 Libya during 1984 without compensation paid to their Chadian
 owner/herders. Persons who have escaped from occupied Chad
 have alleged that the Libyans use food as a weapon to keep
 inhabitants in line.
