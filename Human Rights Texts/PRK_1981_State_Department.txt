 DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA*
 The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was
 formed in 1948 during the Soviet administration of the
 northern half of the Korean peninsula. It is a communist
 state. Although some internationally respected human
 rights are acknowledged by the DPRK constitution and
 laws, individual rights are subordinated in practice
 to the overriding aim of imposing a social revolution
 and marshalling a show of unanimous popular support
 for the country's governing system and its leaders.
 The North Korean people are subject to rigid control
 measures. Persons who fail to cooperate with the
 regime face imprisonment, confiscation of property, or
 enforced removal to remote villages. Observation by
 informers is prevalent. Any movement from one area to
 another requires documentary permission. Punishment
 for "political crimes," (crimes against the state), a
 recognized category of offenses, can be severe.
 The government is controlled by the Korean Workers'
 (conunist) Party which, in turn, is under the domi-
 nation of one man, Kim Il-sung, and his family. The
 latest constitution, promulgated in 1972, purports to
 guarantee a wide range of rights, including: freedom
 of the press, religion, work, and association, and
 freedom from sex discrimination.   Other provisions
 of that constitution tend to contradict or render
 meaningless many of these guarantees.
 The state's intervention in the individual's activities
 in North Korea goes well beyond those of assembly and
 expression. The authorities attempt to shape the
 consciousness of the populace. Pre-school children
 are drilled in homage to Kim Il-sung and his family,
 while youths and adults are required to participate in
 daily ideological training conducted by youth organi-
 zations or at places of employment. The propaganda
 requires rote recitation of party maxims and positions,
 and strives for ideological purity. The result is that
 North Korea's society is one of the most highly regi-
 mented and controlled in the world today. At least two
 North Korean security organizations enforce these
 controls.
 Virtually no outside information, other than that approved
 and disseminated by the North Korean authorities, is allowed
 to reach the North Korean public. Foreigners who have
 traveled to Pyongyang have been surprised to learn how
 little the North Korean populace knows of the outside
 world.
 Despite North Korean claims of being a "socialist
 society," it is far from "classless."  Security ratings
 for each person are based on such considerations as
 ideological fervor and reliability and whether any of
 the individual's relatives or associates collaborated
 with the Japanese occupation or attempted to defect.
 * There was little new information in 1981 on human
 rights practices in North Korea. Few, if. any, significant
 changes are'known to have taken place. Much of this report
 necessarily is based therefore on information obtained over
 a period of time. While limited in scope and detail, the
 information is generally indicative of the human rights
 situation in North Korea.

 These ratings determine access to the better schools,
 positions, and stores, as well as admission to the
 Korean Workers' Party, the route to the highest levels
 and privileges of the society. Any individual whose
 relative or close family associate has settled in South
 Korea is treated as suspect by the North Korean
 authorities.
 The Sixth Congress of the Korean Workers Party was held
 in October 1980. This was the first party congress to
 be held in a decade. Kim Il-sung was "re-elected"
 President of the DPRK and Secretary General of the
 party, and his son, Kim Chong-Il, effectively was
 placed in position eventually to succeed his father.
 That Kim Il-sung appears thus far able to ensure his
 succession by his own son is indicative of the enormous
 power concentrated in his hands over 35 years. The
 absence of any evidence of public debate is also
 indicative of the lack of popular participation in the
 political process. While the Supreme People's Assembly
 "unanimously endorsed" all the decisions and reports of
 K~m il-sung and the Political Bureau of the Central
 Committee without debate or dissent, the party congress
 provided another illustration of the total concentration
 of political power in the hands of Kim II-sung and a
 small group of relatives and close associates.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from;
 a. Torture
 Information on specific criminal justice procedures and
 practices in North Korea is extremely scarce. North
 Korea has refused to permit outside observation of its
 legal system and practices. The accounts provided by
 the crew members of the "USS Pueblo" and by Venezuelan
 poet Ali Lameda comprise virtually all specific infor-
 mation available on the actual operation of the criminal
 justice system in North Korea.
 The accounts of torture and beatings of crew members of
 the "US$ Pueblo" are well known and documented. The
 only other reliable source on prison conditions and
 treatment of prisoners in North Korea is Venezuelan
 poet Ali Lameda, who was detained in North Korea from
 peptember 1967 through May 1974, allegedly for attempted
 sabotage and espionage.    While physical torture was
 not used on Mr. Lameda, he stated that Korean prisoners
 were beaten. Lameda noted that "beating was also used
 as a means of persuasion during interrogatiQn." Further
 details are not available.
 b. Cruel,  nhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Lameda reported the use of deprivation of food to force
 "confessions," as well as solitary confinement, continuous
 interrogation, enforced waking periods, poor or non-existent
 medical treatment, and twelve hours of forced labor 'per day.
 In addition, prisoners were denied family visits, parcels,
 correspondence, writing materials, newspapers, and clothing
 changes. Prisoners appeared to be regarded as persons
 without any rights.
 c. Disappearances
 A U. S. army private of Korean birth disappeared from his
 unit in Germany under suspicious circumstances in 1979,
 
 
 621
 and North Korea claims he is voluntarily there. However,
 repeated efforts to contact him, which were supported by the
 ICRC and U. S. representatives, have been, rebuffed by North
 Korean authorities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 North Korean law provides that the period prisoners may be
 held for interrogation shall not exceed two months. This
 period may be extended indefinitely, however, if the In-
 terrogation Department obtains approval of the Chief
 Prosecutor. Lameda, himself, was detained for twelve months
 without trial or charge. His request for a lawyer of his
 choice and an open trial were ridiculed as "bourgeois."
 Habeas corpus or its equivalent does not exist in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The North Korean constitution states that courts are independent,
 and judicial proceedings are to be carried out in strict
 accordance with law. All courts, however, are "responsible"
 to the people's assemblies, which effectively means total
 governmental control of the judiciary. Article 138 states
 that "cases are heard in public, and the accused is guaranteed
 the right to defense; hearings may be closed to the public
 as stipulated by law." Lameda was twice denied public
 trial. After his first arrest he was imprisoned for a year
 without a hearing; after his second arrest, he was put
 through a closed session without benefit of counsel of his
 choice, or even knowledge of the charges. His tribunal was
 under the direction of the Ministry of Internal Security,
 with one person serving as both judge and prosecutor.
 Lameda stated that, other than to admit guilt, he was
 refused the right to speak out or defend himself at his
 trial. His "defense counsel" represented him by making a
 lengthy speech praising Kim Ilsung and then requesting a 20-
 year sentence, which the tribunal imposed after five minutes
 of deliberation.
 In a 1979 interview with American journalist John Wallach,
 North Korean Supreme Court Justice Li Chun-Uk noted that,
 "his (the defense counsel'sl job is to give the suspect due
 punishment." Open court appears to consist of nothing more
 than ank announcement of the term of imprisonment, which has
 already been determined by the Provincial Safety Bureau.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Article 64 of the constitution states that "citizens are
 guaranteed the inviolability of person and residence and the
 privacy of correspondence." Lameda reported, however, that
 his residence was not respected, and that listening devices
 were used against him. He was arrested and his collected
 papers and poetry destroyed without warrant.
 2. Respect for Civil and'Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Article 53 of the constitution states that "citizens have
 the freedoms of speech, the press, assembly, association and
 demonstration." Article 54 provides that, "citizens have
 the religious liberty and the freedom of anti-religious
 propaganda." In fact, North Koreans enjoy none of these
 rights except in support of government objectives. Other
 articles of the constitution which require citizens to
 follow the "socialist norms of life" and to obey a "collec-
 tive spirit," take precedence over individual political or
 
 
 622
 civil liberties. Censorship of foreign and domestic media
 is enforced and no deviation from the official government
 line is tolerated. Listening to foreign media broadcasts is
 prohibited and violators reportedly are subject to punishment.
 Artistic works are controlled by the government and visitors
 report that a primary function of plays, movies, operas, and
 books apparently is to contribute to the cult of personality
 surrounding "the great leader," Kim Il-sung and his son,
 "the beloved leader," Kim Chong-Il.
 The government has developed a pervasive system of informers
 throughout the society. No public meetings can be held
 without governmental authorization. Trade unions and
 professional associations appear to exist solely as another
 method of governmental control over workers. They have no
 effective rights to organize, negotiate or strike.
 Although freedom of religion allegedly is guaranteed, North
 Korea, in fact, has severely persecuted Christians and
 Buddhists since the late 194Q's, using enforced membership
 in North Korean "religious organizations" as a means of
 identifying and controlling these groups hnd individuals.
 The re ime uses the remaining organizational facades to
 proclaim the practice of religious freedom, but has long
 since purged the membership out of existence. Not only is
 religious practice impossible in North Korea, but persons
 whoue family or relatives once had a strong religious
 background are discriminated against.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 internal travel in North Korea is strictly controlled.
 Documents are required for any movement away from the
 vicinity of one's residence or place of work. The police
 maintain a system of frequent checks. Foreign travel is
 limited to officials or showcase performers. Emigration is
 not Allowed, and few refugees or defectors succeed in
 fleeing the country. Retaliation reportedly is taken
 against the relatives of those few persons who manage to
 escape. North Korea encourages Korean residents overseas to
 repatriate to "the Fatherland." Some observers estimate
 that, since i952, over 10.Q,OQ Korean residents of Japan
 hAve voluntarily repatriated to North Korea. After their
 arrival in North Korea, repatriates are isolated from North
 Korean society until they can be indoctrinated and their
 ideological reliability gauged because of their "corruption"
 by exposure to foreign influences.
 North Korea has permitted some overseas Korean residents to
 return to v*sit their relatives.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The constitution states that all citizens above the age of
 17 may vote and be elected. Political processes in North
 Korea are dominated exclusively by the leadership of the
 Korean Workers Party, which is headed by Kim Il-Sung, who
 also heads the government. The legislature, the Supreme
 People's Assembly, is a rubber-stamp body which never has
 
 
 623
 taken any action other than unanimous passage of resolutions
 presented to it. In an effort to create an appearance of
 democracy, North Korea has sanctioned several "minority
 parties." They exist only as rosters of officials who
 have token representation in the National Assembly and
 completely support the government line.
 North Korea held local elections for members of provincial,
 city and county people's assemblies in March. According
 to the government controlled media, 100 percent of the
 voters turned out to elect 3,705 provincial assembly
 members and 24,191 members of local assemblies. Such
 "elections" in reality are a mandatory exercise in which
 "voters" are required to turn out to approve candidates
 selected in advance by the party.
 The average citizen is completely excluded from any real
 participation in the political process unless he becomes a
 member of the Korean Worker's party, the selection process
 for entrance to which is long and rigorous. Even the
 lower levels of the party have no voice, serving only to
 carry out the fiats, decrees, and "on the spot guidance"
 promulgated by the party's leadership, dominated by Kim
 Il-sung. Individuals from "bad social backgrounds"; i.e.,
 those who have relatives who fled south during the Korean
 war, those whose families had strong religious backgrounds
 or were once property owners or members of the bourgeoisie,
 and those who have relatives who are political prisoners
 effectively are denied participation in the political
 process and are discriminated against.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No organizations exist within North Korea to report on or
 observe human rights violations. North Korea does not
 participate in any international or regional human rights
 organizations. On September 14, 1981, North Korea acceded
 to the International Covenant on Civil and Political
 Rights and the International Convenant on Economic, Social
 and Cultural Rights. Amnesty International has requested
 a visit to North Korea; the government has not responded
 to or acknowledged this request.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 North Korea is a less developed country with a highly
 centralized, planned economy. Many observers believe that
 after a period of rapid growth in the 1960s and early
 1970s, the economy has experienced difficulties in recent
 years due largely to an overemphasis on self-sufficiency,
 centralized planning, heavy industrialization and military
 expenditures.
 North Korea claims that per capita gross national product is
 $1,900, but most independent observers consider the real
 figure to be closer to $850. Health care and education are
 free to all citizens; food and shelter are provided at
 nominal cost. 15-20 percent of North Korea's GNP consis-
 tently is committed to military expenditures, the second
 highest such level in the world. This policy has seriously
 retarded the progress of the civilian economy.
 
 
 624
 Per capita income in North Korea is estimated by the World
 Bank to be approximately $1,100. Income distribution
 appears to be relatively equitable, although the party and
 government elite enjoy significant economic privileges,
 e.g., access to special stores, better housing, better
 education, which are not available to average citizens.
 Average wage rates for workers reportedly vary from 50-150
 won per month with rents for state supplied apartments
 averaging 15-2Q won. Basic food supplies are heavily
 subsidized and rationed for equal distribution.
 Articles 58 and 59 of the constitution guarantee citizens
 the right to free health care and education. North Korea
 appears to have invested considerable effort and money in
 developing a comprehensive health care system for its
 citizenry. Both pre- and post-working age citizens are
 cared for by the state, and their basic physical necessities
 reportedly are provided for satisfactorily. Life expectancy
 is estimated at 63 years. The population grew in the 1970's
 at an annual rate of 2.5 percent.
 The North Korean government provides eleven years of com-
 pulsory free education to its citizens and claims to have
 eliminated illiteracy. While this claim cannot be sub-
 stantiated, the literacy rate undoubtedly is high in com-
 parison with most developing countries.
 Article 62 of the constitution states that "women hold equal
 social status and rights with men." Despite this provision,
 few women reach high levels of the party or government.
 Women are represented proportionally in the labor force and
 personnel in small factories are predominately women.
 Reportedly, women are often paid less than men for similar
 work.
