 TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
 
 A former British colony, Trinidad and Tobago inherited
 many of its political and legal forms and practices --
 strongly emphasizing rights of the person -- from the
 United Kingdom. Multiracial and religiously diverse,
 the country is a stable, multiparty, parliamentary
 democracy with a generally excellent record of human
 rights observance. There is universal adult suffrage
 (from age 18), and free and fair elections are held
 regularly. Parliamentary elections were held in
 November 1981. Prime Minister George Chambers led
 the ruling People's National Movement to victory.
 The constitution enshrines internationally-accepted
 fundamental rights and freedoms without discrimination
 by reason of race, origin, color, religion or sex.
 The judiciary is independent and the Privy Council
 in the United Kingdom serves as the court of final
 appeal.
 The economy is based on free enterprise, but with
 extensive mixed ownership of industrial plants and
 public utilities and a high degree of government
 direction of the economy. The tax system is progres-
 sive. The country has a rapidly developing and
 generally prosperous economy, and wealth is fairly
 well distributed. Health conditions generally are
 good. Education is widely available, and the literacy
 rate is 95 percent. The government's economic welfare
 programs are administered on a non-discriminatory
 basis.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is forbidden under the law and is not permitted
 in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The constitution forbids cruel and unusual treatment or
 punishment, and this prohibition is generally observed
 in practice. From time to time there have been
 allegations of excessive police roughness in individual
 cases. On occasion police officers have b~en punished
 for such illegal behavior. Despite some improvements
 in recent years, physical conditions in the prisons
 remain harsh. A commission' of inquiry into prison
 conditions, headed by the Anglican bishop, was estab-
 lished in 1974 and, following numerous public sessions
 and public hearings, submitted its final report
 and recommendations in February 1980. The report
 recommended remedial measures to stop police roughness
 and to improve prison conditions. Thud far, however,
 only some minor improvements in prison conditions
 have been made.
 c. Disappearances
 There are no reports of disappearances.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Protection against arbitrary detention or imprisonment
 is constitutionally guaranteed, as is habeas corpus.
 There have been instances, however, when a suspected
 person has been held under detention for some time
 before charges were formally made. There are more
 frequent charges of excessive delays between arrest
 and trial. Both shortcomings result from an overbur-
 dened and understaffed legal system, and are not
 a consequence of government policy. The report
 of a comnission of inquiry has recommended measures
 to correct these shortcomings. There are no political
 prisoners.
 e. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 The right of accused persons to a fair and public
 hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal in
 criminal cases is guaranteed under the constitution
 and is observed in practice. In addition, the state
 provides legal aid to impecunious citizens in both
 civil and criminal cases.
 f. Invasion of the Rome
 The constitution provides for security of the person
 and the sanctity of the home. These provisions
 are, for the most part, observed. There have been
 press comments about alleged over-zealous house
 searches and the issuance of search warrants without
 sufficient cause.'
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of expression, the press, religious belief
 and observances, association and assembly is constitu-
 tionally guaranteed and respected in practice. Public
 meetings are allowed, but permits must be obtained
 in advance from the police. The government does not
 impede labor unions in their legally-guaranteed rights
 to organize, negotiate and strike, except that strikes
 are prohibited by law in essential services (such as
 police, firemen, health and sanitation services, power
 and telephone workers, civil servants and air traffic
 controllers). Trade union organization is extensive,
 covering about 30 percent of the work force, and
 collective bargaining is vigorous and widespread.
 The ministry of labor is an impartial mediator in
 labor disputes.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement
 within the country or on foreign travel and emigration,
 all of which are covered under the constitution's
 freedom of movement provision. Trinidad and Tobago
 long has served as a haven for people from neighboring
 areas seeking a better economic future. In turn,
 many people have emigrated from the country for
 similar reasons. All citizens have the right to
 re-enter the country, and this right is observed
 in practice.
 
 
 534
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 All:citizens, regardless of sex, race or religion, can
 take part in the political process. The right to join
 political parties and to express political views is
 guaranteed by the constitution. Numerous political
 parties exist and participate in free elections,
 which are held regularly.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government of Trinidad and Tobago supports the
 international observance of human rights and does
 not object in principle to international apd non-
 governmental investigations of alleged human rights
 violations. The government, however, has expressed
 publicly its concern that allegations of human rights
 violations can lead to unwarranted interference in
 the internal affairs of sovereign states and that
 investigations of such allegations can be used by the
 strong to apply pressure on the weak. The government
 does not support the use of any non-economic criteria
 in the consideration of loan or other assistance
 requests by international financial institutions
 and organizations. Trinidad and Tobago has never
 been the subject of international or non-governmental
 investigations in the human rights field. Several
 human rights organizations operate freely and openly
 in the country. They have chosen to concentrate their
 efforts on educating the public, calling attention
 to alleged shortcomings and violations and advocating
 changes in the distribution of oil-generated prosperity.
 A constitutionally-mandated ombudsman investigates
 allegations by citizens that-their rights have been
 violated by government agencies.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Trinidad and Tobago is recently petrodollar-rich but is
 still a developing country. Economic growth accelerated
 after oil prices were increased in 1974. The government's
 economic development strategy centers on a number of
 high-technology industrial projects which can utilize
 the country's extensive gas reserves. Implementation
 is under way. The manufacturing sector also is
 being encouraged and is expanding. Capital formation,
 financed both officially and privately, has been
 at a high level in recent years. Infrastructure
 development is proceeding, but is lagging behind the
 pace of industrial construction.
 Real growth in 1980 was estimated at ten percent,
 following growth of 17 percent in 1979 and 7.7 percent
 in 1978. Per capita income (for a population of
 1.2 million, with an annual growth rate of 1.3 percent)
 is now estimated at about $4,000.
 The right to enjoyment of property, which is, for the
 most part, privately held and transacted, is protected
 by the constitution. Most farmland is privately
 owned. The majority of landholdings are small,
 with nearly half under five acres. A government
 land redistribution program encourages the establishment
 
 
 535
 of~medium-sizad family farms (5-20 acres) devoted
 to cash crops.
 Unemployment has fallen from a high of 15.2 percent
 in .975 to.11.9.-percent.in 1979, and there are labor
 shortages .in..some skilled and semi-skilled jobs.
 The government provides-public works jobs.for large
 -numbers of the.unemployed. -The stronger labor unions
 have negotiated large wage increases and improved
 -working conditions. Women receive the same pay
 as -men for the same work.and occupy many important
 positions .in .government, the. professions and business.
 There are women in-the police force and the army.
 Free.medical care is available and accounts for
 10.6 Dercent of government, expenditures (1978).
 Both urban and rural health care facilities are
 .being built, expanded or modernized. Health conditions
 generally are-good. Nutritional requirements are met.
 *The mortality rate and the incidence of most diseases
 are.declining ..Life expectancy in 1979 was 70.5
 years. The 1979 infant mortality rate was 28.6
 per thousand live births. All the .urban population
 .and most (95 percent) of the rural population has
 access to safe water.
 Ptblic.education is-free through secondary school
 and accounts for 19.2 percent of government expenditure
 (1978). It-is belng.expanded and revised to prepare
 better those who enter directly-into the job market.
 -The University of the West -Indies has a campus in
 Trinidad, but many citizens still go abroad (to
 .the United Kingdom, the-United-States and Canada)
 for higher education. The literacy rate is 95 percent.
 Virtually -all school-age children (99 percent) are
 enrolled.
 ,Income.distribution is relatively uneven. The poorest
 40 percent-of-the population (in 1975) received
 about 11 percent of total income, and the top ten
 percent received over'31 percent, while the middle
 50 percent received 57 percent. Pockets of poverty,
 .which exist in some-urban-and rural areas, are
 not.large. A~housing shortage exists, and squatters
 ,:abound. on-both government and private lands, but
 housing-construction programs are underway.
 -Expenditures for social needs (housing, health,
 education and welfare)-account for about one-third
 -of the-national budget. Staple food prices are
 *-kept relatively low through government subsidies,
 and "a free. school lunch program.-- now functioning
 on a limited scale -- is being expanded. Food stamps
 .are available to the.elderly and other needy persons.
 There is a--national insurance (social security) plan,
 to which both employers and employees contribute;
 the benefits. are-relatively.generous and are expanding.
 The government-administers health, education and
 income supplement programs on-a non-discriminatory
 basis. :Charges that Tobago has received insufficient
 benefits from the recent economic prosperity have
 diminished since the sister isle obtained limited
 -autonomy in 1980 and since the national government
 modified its treatment of the island during 1981.
