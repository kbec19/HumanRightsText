 CHAD
 Even more than most young African states, Chad is beset
 by serious fundamental weaknesses and profound socio-
 economic conflicts. Historically, no nation remotely
 resembling present day Chad existed, and it was only in the
 late 1930's that the French colonial administration began to
 include what is now the national territory. Moreover, Chad
 developed few political and economic institutions during the
 colonial era. It is generally unable to feed its popula-
 tion, and remains among the world's ten poorest countries.
 Chad is also beset by profound social, ethnic, regional and
 religious divisions. There are the nomads of the north
 versus the semi-nomadic peoples of the Sahel, versus the
 sedentary farmers of the South; the Arabs and others of
 Arabized culture versus the more traditional black African
 groups, the northern ex-slavers versus the southern ex-
 slaves; the Muslims versus the animists and Christians. The
 situation is further complicated by external interference.
 These and other problems resulted in a civil war which has
 been festering since 1965. In February 1979, the civil war
 erupted in the streets of N'Djamena, the capital, and the
 old southern-dominated order was overthrown, probably
 irrevocably. The victors, however, were so ill-equipped to
 govern, and so divided among themselves, that it has thus
 far proved impossible to constitute anything resembling a
 viable national government. In August 1979, the leaders of
 the various factions signed an agreement providing for
 demilitarization of the capital and formation of an interim
 coalition government pending national elections. Thus far,
 however, efforts to implement this agreement have been
 unsuccessful. There is no single leader or group with
 the power necessary to assert control over the country. The
 bureaucracy has largely ceased to function because the
 southerners who staffed most of it fled the capital. The
 treasury is empty. Law and order are tenuous at best.
 The limited modern sector of the economy has been shattered.
 The south is in a state of de facto secession. The social,
 ethnic and religious divisions have been further intensified
 by war-engendered massacres and hatreds on all sides. Such
 government as exists is provided mostly by half a dozen
 armed political factions with power bases in various parts
 of the country. Some of them have formed an uneasy alliance
 under which their ill-disciplined armed forces control the
 capital.
 Under these conditions, it is extremely difficult to
 assess the civil rights situation in a meaningful fashion.
 To point out that it is poor merely belabors the obvious.
 One can hardly say that the Chadian government is to blame
 for these conditions since, for most practical purposes,
 there is no government. Many of the questions which would
 normally be asked in assessing human rights are simply
 irrelevant. There is no fundamental charter or legal system
 to evaluate or against which performance can be measured.
 The phrase "human rights" in large measure implies the
 existence of laws and government; it is not compatible with
 a condition which often resembles anarchy.

 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There are reliable reports that some prisoners have been
 tortured by various armed factions during interrogation,
 particularly during periods of intense combat. However,
 there is no evidence that such practices are systematic
 or widespread.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Even though jails are primitive, serious mistreatment has not
 normally been a condition of imprisonment in Chad. There have
 been reports of summary executions of prisoners during combat.
 Although these reports are credible, under current conditions
 they cannot be fully documented. The Red Cross, which has
 been given access to most if not all of the prisoners of war
 currently being held, reports that abuse and executions are
 more in the nature of isolated incidents than widespread.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrests and imprisonment for indeterminate periods
 have been virtually daily occurrences since the breakdown
 of government in February. The most illiterate and untrain-
 ed armed combatants of the various functions make these
 arrests on grounds such as suspicion of spying, being of a
 different ethnic group or simply whim.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Since there is no longer a functioning judicial system,
 there are no trials in the normal sense of the term. The
 various factions sometimes establish "revolutionary courts"
 but the standards of justice in them are not known.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Since February 1979, widespread looting of homes by armed
 combatants of various factions has been (and remains) a
 serious problem. Although this looting is not explicitly
 condoned by the leaders of the various factions, neither
 have they been able or willing to take the kind of action
 which would be necessary to suppress it.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 AID/Chad described the pre-February 1979 government as
 "sincerely concerned with equity problems, displaying this
 concern through concentration on food production and improve-
 ment of rural small farm economies in the development sphere.
 Performance by the government is as good as can be expected
 considering constraints imposed by military, economic and
 manpower problems". Since February however all development-
 activities and most government services, such as education,
 health care, etc., hav been almost totally disrupted. The
 leaders of the various factions express an apparently genuine
 
 
 45
 desire to restore these services and proceed with economic
 development. Realistically, however, economic normalization
 and provision of social services will depend on progress
 toward a political settlement and establishment of an effec-
 tive government.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 There is no domestic press in Chad, except for the single
 radio station and a mimeographed news sheet under the control
 of the factions occupying N'Djamena, and two radio stations
 operated by the faction controlling the south. Foreign publi-
 cations are freely circulated, however, and foreign correspon-
 dents are able to function (although they are regarded with
 suspicion and at times have been subjected to arbitrary
 actions such as confiscation of notes and film). In spite of
 communal problems which erupt from time to time, there are no
 serious problems with regard to freedom of religion, and all
 faction leaders profess support of the principle. Generally,
 there is no freedom of assembly for political purposes.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Domestic travel is not prohibited in principle, but it is
 severely circumscribed by the difficulty, and often danger,
 of moving between zones controlled by the various factions.
 Emigration and foreign travel are controlled but not in
 a repressive fashion, through the issuance of travel documents.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 At this time, the "political process" in Chad consists
 of efforts--peaceful and otherwise--of various armed factions
 and personalities to resolve the 14 year old civil war
 and establish a national government. Individuals can partici-
 pate in this process by joining one of the factions. There
 are no electoral procedures or political parties in the usual
 sense of the term. A new trade union confederation and a new
 youth organization were recently formed, but there is no
 evidence that they are having any political impact on the
 situation. The status of women is circumscribed by Muslim and
 tribal traditions.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The Department of State is not aware of any attempts by
 international or non-governmental groups to investigate
 alleged human rights violations in Chad. It is important to
 note, however, that the International Red Cross has been
 active in Chad since March 1978, with the approval of all
 the factions concerned. During the past year, it has facili-
 tated the release of several thousand family members of war
 prisoners held by various factions; it has provided food and
 medicine to the war prisoners still being held; it has helped
 protect, feed, and move refugees; and has passed thousands
 
 
 46
 of family messages across hostile lines. The Red Cross
 reports that it has been accorded cooperation by all the armed
 factions. Amnesty International issued a report on Chad in
 1978, but it is totally outdated due to the fundamentally
 changed situation in the country since February 1979.
