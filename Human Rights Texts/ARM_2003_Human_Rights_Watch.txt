ARMENIA
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
With presidential and parliamentary elections slated for the first half of 2003,
President Robert Kocharian consolidated his ascendancy over a fragmented opposition.
A broad range of scheduled criminal justice reforms was delayed by parliament’s
reluctance to outlaw the death penalty.
As the 2003 elections approached, two television channels that did not cover
politics from a pro-government standpoint lost their broadcasting licenses. Following
the September 2001 shutdown of the Noyan Tapan television channel, the
A1+ television channel was taken off the air in April, immediately after losing a
government-organized tender. The closure sparked a series of protest rallies in the
capital,Yerevan, kept up until June by a group of opposition parties that used them
to call for Kocharian’s resignation or impeachment. In the days following such rallies,
police detained protesters at their homes in Yerevan or in the regions, or summoned
them to local police stations.Dozens were fined or given terms of up to two
weeks of imprisonment, in what resembled a concerted action directed at deterring
further participation in the continuing rallies.
The April tender was administered by a commission appointed by the president,
as provided for in the October 2000 law on television and radio. Ironically, the law’s
avowed purpose was to comply with Council of Europe requirements on promoting
pluralism and independence in the broadcast media. Also in April the government
had to withdraw a draft law on the media it had published in February, after
Council of Europe experts criticized it. The draft had proposed the establishment
of an oversight body from which all media outlets would have to seek an operating
license renewal every year; it also required journalists to pay government officials
for information. In October the entire run of the opposition newspaper Aravot vanished
the day it published corruption allegations against associates of the prime
minister. Also that month, independent journalist Mark Grigorian was injured by
a grenade thrown at him on the street.
Parliament ratified the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and
the European Convention on Human Rights. Respectively, the ratifications paved
the way for the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture to inspect
Armenian detention facilities, and for Armenian citizens to file complaints with the
European Court of Human Rights.
Police torture continued, however, facilitated by several factors. Human rights
defenders in Yerevan and Vanadzor asserted that widespread and routine police torture
and ill-treatment went largely unreported due to victims’ well-grounded fear
of retribution, which deterred them from filing complaints or permitting human
rights groups to work on their cases.
Lack of legal reform served to perpetuate incommunicado detention, another
key condition facilitating torture.Police appeared to exploit a loophole in the criminal procedure code that leaves witnesses without the right to an attorney: individuals
would be summoned as witnesses, denied counsel, and then charged as suspects
hours or days later. Police also detained people on misdemeanor charges
under the administrative code for up to fifteen days, exploiting the code’s failure to
allow those detained under it access to counsel; typically charges involved insulting
a police officer or failing to obey a police officer.Meanwhile, the incommunicado
period allowed police to abuse the detainee and work up more serious criminal
charges. The administrative court system appeared to be little more than a “pocket
court” for police, as it was served by judges from courts of first instance, known for
their lack of independence, and misdemeanor detention proceedings lacked regulation
by a procedural code. At hearings where judges sanctioned administrative
detentions the defendant almost always either had no counsel or was absent altogether;
often, police would send the papers for signature to the judge at home after
work hours.
In general, judges continued to display subservience to executive authorities,
and did not, as a rule, challenge the procuracy or police. Monitoring of over fifty
cases by the Armenian Helsinki Association, collated in a report issued in January,
found that trial judges often handed down arbitrary decisions, tended to intimidate
witnesses offering testimonies “disliked” by the procuracy, and generally ignored
defendants’ claims of physical abuse or procedural violations.
The trial of the individuals allegedly responsible for the October 1999 murders
in Parliament entered its second year.At least two individuals were criminally prosecuted
for expressing the belief that Kocharian was behind the murders. In June,
Janik Adamian and his typist were detained after he posted throughout the town of
Ararat a poem in which he wrote of an unnamed “dishonest dog”who had a hand
in the murders. The prosecutor dropped the charges when the case went to trial in
September. In late 2001, police detained Musheg Saghatelian, an opposition politician
and former prisons chief, after he accused Kocharian of masterminding the
murders. A court sentenced Saghatelian to seven years of imprisonment, reduced
on appeal in July to six years. Among the various charges leveled against him were
counts for the 1995 beating ofMinistry of Interior officers who had been alleged to
have been plotting a coup against then-President Levon Ter-Petrossian.
While Saghatelian deserved to answer for torture and ill-treatment, both his
conviction and the authorities’ failure to seek murder convictions for the September
2001 killing of Poghos Poghossian by presidential bodyguards demonstrated
the selectiveness with which law enforcement agencies and courts treated cases
involving the interests of the executive. Poghossian had died in the restroom of a
Yerevan nightspot minutes after he had addressed an impertinent greeting to
Kocharian. Compelling testimonies and forensic evidence made available to
Human Rights Watch showed that a group of security personnel, including
Kocharian’s bodyguards, had beaten Poghossian to death. Yet after a two-month
investigation the procuracy charged just one bodyguard on a count of involuntary
manslaughter, for which a court in February handed him a one-year suspended
sentence.
Although the defense minister claimed a decline in non-combat deaths in the
army— from two hundred in 1998 to ninety-two in 2001—no serious reform was undertaken to reduce brutality in the military. In November 2001 the former head
of the Defense Ministry’s inspection commission alleged that the military prosecutor’s
office systematically thwarted investigation of beatings and killings of conscripts
by older soldiers.
With many young men emigrating or extending their studies, often to avoid
conscription, military authorities rode roughshod over the law in order to keep
conscript numbers up. They reportedly intimidated or tricked refugees into draft
enrolment, although the 1999 Law on Refugees confirmed their exemption from
compulsory conscription. In November 2001, students demonstrated when their
draft deferments were arbitrarily canceled. The following month eleven who took
the Defense Ministry to court to challenge their conscription orders were drafted
and delivered to military bases the day before their scheduled hearing. Artiom
Sargsian, a leader of the November 2001 student protests, was beaten and kicked to
death in February in army barracks in Vanadzor, two months after he was drafted.
Parliament delayed the adoption of a law to allow alternative civilian service,and
in September adopted a law setting cash fees for draft deferments or waivers,
including a U.S.$15,000 bond for any young man enrolling privately for study
abroad. The authorities continued to prosecute and imprison conscientious objectors,
most of whom were Jehovah’s Witnesses.
The prime minister included the deputy defense minister in a re-established
government Council for Religious Affairs, and at its September meeting called for
new curbs on nontraditional faiths, claiming they endangered national security.
The procuracy appealed the acquittal of Levon Markarian, a Jehovah’s Witness
tried in 2001 for having led prayer meetings at which families with children were
present. In April, the Supreme Court, to its credit, upheld his acquittal.
Parliament passed amendments to the electoral code in July that reversed
reforms of December 2000 by reducing the number of parliamentary seats allocated
to party lists in favor of single-mandate constituencies. In the current political
context, this change was seen to favor the pro-presidential Republican Party, as
wealthy businessmen with links to the government have tended to win single-mandate
constituencies. The amendments also placed the majority of appointments to
all election commissions in the hands of the president and of parties allied with
him. A national survey conducted by the International Foundation for Election
Systems during 2001 and published in 2002 revealed deep public disillusionment,
with 62 percent of respondents considering that Armenia did not function as a
democracy.
The opaque way in which the government privatized powerful monopolies such
as the electricity grid and Yerevan’s Zvartnots airport raised questions, and the tariff
policies of the privatized telephone network,Armentel,provoked public demonstrations.
Marginalized populations were particularly vulnerable to government
privatization policy: In February and April the government auctioned off the lease
of remote pastures that Kurdish Yezidis, an ethnic and religious minority, had used
for decades for grazing their sheep and cattle. Because municipal border gerrymandering
in the early 1990s had deprived many Yezidi herders of a share in land
privatization, with the recent auctions many Yezidis lost their land rights and their
livelihood.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Nongovernmental human rights organizations were generally able to carry out
their work without government interference.
Sadly, the Presidential Human Rights Commission lent its weight to the procuracy’s
prosecution of Levon Markarian by issuing a statement in May expressing its
regret at his acquittal. The commission claimed that Markarian had deprived the
twelve children present at his service “of their right freely to practice their national
religion and derive benefit from their people’s culture,” misstating guarantees
under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
In August the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination
reviewed Armenia’s amalgamated third and fourth periodic reports. The committee
criticized the government for describing Armenia as a “mono-ethnic” state,
despite the existence of several ethnic and national minorities, and for failing to
provide concrete information on their socioeconomic situation and on the implementation
of minority rights legislation. The committee also expressed concern at
the government’s failure to respond to allegations of governmental discrimination
against the Yezidi minority.
The U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women,
after considering Armenia’s second periodic report in August, expressed concern
that Armenia lacked legislation on domestic violence and trafficking in persons and
that penalties for rape remained light. The committee urged the government to
ensure prosecution of violence against women.
Council of Europe
The Council of Europe intensified its scrutiny of Armenia’s post-accession obligations
and exerted pressure on the government to implement reforms on a wide
front, ranging from the abolition of administrative detention to the establishment
of an ombudsman.
In September the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE)
adopted a resolution threatening to suspend the Armenian delegation’s credentials
should the government fail to abolish the death penalty fully by 2003. The resolution
expressed “shock” that the Armenian parliament had adopted in first reading
a draft criminal code that included the death penalty for aggravated murder.
The PACE Monitoring Committee criticized unjustified delays in the elaboration
of a new constitution and criminal code, and noted that the authorities used
each in turn as an excuse for failing to ratify Protocol No. 6 of the European Convention
on Human Rights, which outlaws the death penalty in all circumstances.
Forceful Council of Europe expert opinions on the government’s draft media
law compelled its withdrawal.Noting the controversial tenders that saw independent
television stations taken off the air in April, in its September resolution the
PACE pointedly referred the government to its stated commitment to offer new
frequencies to tender by late October.
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Office in
Yerevan commissioned several Armenian nongovernmental organizations to monitor
and produce a range of reports on the functioning of the criminal justice system,
and one on the extent of abusive conscription of exempted refugees,
publishing them on the internet (at http://www.osce.org/yerevan/).
United States
The U.S. State Department’s second Trafficking in Persons Report, published in
June,described Armenia as a country of origin for women and girls trafficked to the
United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Russia, Greece, and Germany for sexual exploitation.
The report criticized the government for failing to develop a national plan or
take significant steps to counter trafficking. The government began drafting a
national plan in October.
The State Department’s second International Religious Freedom Report, published
in October, described the restrictive registration regime instituted for
minority faiths since 1991, and chronicled the authorities’ maneuvers over years to
deny registration to Jehovah’s Witnesses.
