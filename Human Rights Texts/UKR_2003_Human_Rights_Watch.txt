UKRAINE
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Despite progress in recent years, the human rights situation in Ukraine in 2002
remained uneven.Numerous irregularities were reported during the March parliamentary
elections.Virtually all major media owners depended on state ties for survival
and were thus subject to censorship. Opposition media and activists
continued to face harassment. Prison conditions and torture in detention received
attention from the national ombudsperson, but remained serious problems.
Racism, trafficking in persons, and discrimination against women, migrants,
refugees, and persons living with HIV/AIDS persisted.
National and regional parliamentary elections in March reflected the mixed
human rights situation. The European Union and the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) noted Ukraine’s progress toward complying
with international standards for democratic elections. Yet despite certain positive
developments, including greater transparency, international observers noted significant
flaws. Shortcomings in the campaigning period involved abuse of state
resources by incumbent candidates and preference given to certain candidates in
the use of state facilities.
Observers also noted an imbalance in the distribution of election commission
chairperson positions, with some 70 percent being drawn from pro-presidential
parties. In Lugansk, public employees were threatened with dismissal for refusal to
sign a “social agreement” that committed them to vote for a pro-presidential party.
The campaign was marred also by the murder of Mykola Shkibliak, a prominent
Social Democratic Party (United) candidate, on the eve of the elections. On election
day OSCE observers reported other incidents of violence, intimidation, and
inappropriate influencing of voters.
The state of independent media continued to deteriorate throughout 2002.
Although a broad range of media provided a diversity of political views during the
parliamentary campaign, most media failed to provide impartial and fair coverage.
Ukraine’s six national television channels were either state-owned or controlled by
persons close to the president. As a result, opposition parties frequently faced
obstruction in accessing local and national media, and major television and radio
outlets offered disproportionately more and only positive coverage to pro-presidential
political figures.
Independent media sources and journalists faced government harassment and
legal pressure in the form of tax inspections and arbitrary licensing procedures.
Four television stations lost their broadcasting licenses in 2002, including Studio
1+1, which continues to broadcast pending a final court decision.
Journalists complained of political censorship. In early October, staff of
UNIAN, an independent news agency, posted a statement denouncing the “fierce
pressure”they encountered since the appointment of a new executive director.Censorship
on television stations led many prominent newscasters to resign and motivated
journalists to sign statements denouncing political pressure and organize a
trade union to combat official coercion. Journalists and editors also reported physical
violence. Police officers beat and detained Oleh Zavada for taking photographs
during opposition protests in October.
The murders of investigative journalists Georgiy Gongadze in 2000 and Oleh
Breus and Ihor Aleksandrov in 2001, remained unsolved despite continued international
demands for transparent and timely criminal investigations that would
involve international commissions of inquiry. Authorities repeatedly attempted to
obscure their failures to properly investigate the Gongazde case. In January, the
deputy prosecutor general claimed, falsely, that the Council of Europe had declined
to create an international commission of inquiry. Increasing international pressure
led the government to accept foreign technical assistance in examining evidence, but prosecutors subsequently refused to cooperate with United States (U.S.) Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) homicide experts dispatched to Ukraine in April.
In September, the parliament’s ad hoc commission for investigating Gongadze’s
disappearance recommended that criminal charges be brought against President
Leonid Kuchma and other top officials in connection with the crime, based on tape
recordings of a meeting at which Kuchma allegedly asked security officials to “take
care”of the journalist.Based on these allegations, the Kyiv Court of Appeals opened
a criminal case against Kuchma in mid-October.
On September 16, major opposition groups organized anti-Kuchma protests
throughout the country to mark the second anniversary of Gongadze’s disappearance
and to call for the president’s resignation. Local authorities in Kiev attempted
to prevent the demonstrations from being held in the center of the city, and prevented
thousands from participating by denying entrance to cars and buses arriving
from outside of the capital. A government memo issued to national media
outlets recommended that television and radio sources avoid broadcasting information
about the demonstrations and press conferences held by opposition parties.
On the morning of the demonstrations, all six national television stations were
off the air for “maintenance.” Following the demonstrations, several thousand riot
police armed with shields and rubber truncheons beat and arrested dozens of protesters
who had set up a tent camp in front of the president’s office.
Torture and ill-treatment by law enforcement officials continued as in recent
years. The Ukrainian Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights reported that
30 percent of prisoners were victims of torture and perpetrators rarely faced prosecution.
In a rare exception to the general rule of impunity, the Mozola family,with
extensive help from the Ukrainian ombudsperson, won damages in a case against
the state security services for the death of their son by torture in pre-trial detention
in 1996. There also continued to be widespread reports of bullying and hazing of
military conscripts.
Arbitrary detention and excessively long periods of pre-trial detention
remained serious problems.Poor prison conditions—overcrowding, malnutrition,
and insufficient access to health care—have led to inmate violence, a death rate ten
times that of the population at large, and high rates of tuberculosis among inmates.
In its review of Ukraine’s fourth periodic report in November 2001, the United
Nations (U.N.) Committee against Torture noted many ongoing deficiencies in the
penal system, including the lack of clarity regarding the time when a detained person
may exercise the rights to counsel, medical examination, and contact with a
family member.
Ukraine’s minority populations faced racism, discrimination, and intolerance.
Crimean Tartars, deported during the Soviet era but recently returned to Ukraine,
succeeded in gaining citizenship but still encountered obstacles in access to jobs
and housing and in securing official recognition of their language. The results of
the March elections saw Crimean Tartar candidates elected to governing bodies,
thereby improving the previously weak Crimean Tartar political representation.
Roma continued to battle discrimination resulting in socioeconomic disadvantage,
high unemployment, insufficient political representation, and racially motivated
police harassment.
In January, Ukraine acceded to the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention and its 1967
Protocol. Throughout 2001-2002, Ukraine detained hundreds of undocumented
migrants—including would-be asylum seekers—arrested in transit to Western
Europe in the newly established Pavshino camp on its western border. This detention
was under inhumane conditions and the authorities lacked funds to repatriate
detainees who expressed the desire to return home.According to the U.S.Committee
for Refugees,Ukrainian border guards allowed only three of 4,620 apprehended
foreigners,many of whom were Afghans fleeing the Taliban, to lodge asylum claims
during 2001.
Ukraine continued as both a country of origin and transit for large numbers of
trafficked persons. In its 2002 trafficking in persons report, the U.S. State Department
placed Ukraine on the list of countries not yet in compliance with the minimum
standards for the elimination of trafficking, despite some official efforts to
improve the situation. In May, the government approved a comprehensive program
for 2002-05 designed to combat trafficking through increased criminal investigative
efforts, and to improve services for victims including counselling and shelter.
In November 2001, parliament passed a new law on the prevention of domestic
violence that offered a broad definition of domestic violence and recognized marital
rape as a crime. In June the U.N.Committee on Elimination of Discrimination
against Women credited Ukraine for adopting the new law but expressed concern
about the prevalence of violence against women and the need for improved measures
for prosecution and victims’ services.
According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), women
constituted 80 percent of the unemployed due mostly to discrimination in hiring
and disproportionate lay-offs, including illegal dismissals during maternity leave.
Women made up more than half of university graduates, and three-fourths of
unemployed women held university degrees. For those in the work force, women’s
salaries equalled only 73 percent those of men in comparable positions.
A U.N. report released during the International AIDS Conference in Barcelona
said Ukraine had one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world, and
concluded that the disease had spread beyond injecting drug users into the general
population. The disease was virtually unheard of in Ukraine as late as 1994, but by
2002 as many as four hundred thousand persons were estimated to be living with
HIV/AIDS. The government declared that it would make fighting AIDS a priority.
However, a widespread lack of information on HIV transmission and a long history
of marginalization and criminalization of drug users motivated discrimination
against persons living with the disease, as reported by the international press and
NGOs.
Ukraine continued to be implicated as a major weapons supplier to human
rights abusers, areas of violent conflict, and embargoed countries. Ukraine’s submission
to the U.N. arms register showed that it sold attack helicopters to, among
others,Algeria,Angola, Chad, Guinea, and Sri Lanka in 2001. A U.N. report issued
in October 2001, documented that Ukraine served as the point of origin for
weapons funnelled to embargoed Liberia. In September 2002, the U.S. recognized
as authentic a tape recording of President Kuchma approving the sale of sophisticated
air defense radar systems to Iraq in 2000. In October, legislation to control the arms trade was introduced in parliament. To date, arms trade control measures
remained elaborated only in ad hoc presidential and cabinet decrees.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Ukraine’s diverse civil society included human rights, ethnic, religious, and
women’s groups. Some groups have reported problems with local authorities over
registration and taxation. The ombudswoman actively investigated human rights
abuses and highlighted poor prison conditions.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
In considering Ukraine in late 2001, the U.N. Human Rights Committee continued
to prioritize threats to freedom of expression and information. It also recommended
that authorities ensure that national minorities enjoy use of their own
language. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which
reviewed the country in August 2001, noted continuing stereotyping and racial
profiling, including arbitrary arrests and illegal detention targeting in particular
the Romani population, and called for the development of effective disciplinary
measures for officials committing human rights violations.
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
In a February visit Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) High Commissioner on National Minorities Rolf Ekéus encouraged
Ukrainian authorities to address discrimination against Roma,refugees, and immigrants.
The OSCE representative on freedom of the media called on authorities to
conduct a thorough investigation into the disappearance and murder of Gongadze.
The OSCE project coordinator in Ukraine provided trainings on the observance of
human rights in Ukrainian courts and worked closely with authorities to create an
administrative court system and improve legislation to combat the trafficking of
persons.
Council of Europe
The chairman of the Committee ofMinisters visited Ukraine in December 2001
to examine progress made by Ukraine in meeting its Council of Europe commitments.
The chairman noted some positive results, particularly given that in April
2001 the Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) had recommended Ukraine’s exclusion
for failure to honor its obligations. However, the chairman and the PACE both
stressed continuing shortcomings, including the unresolved cases of murdered
journalists and the lack of an independent judiciary able to enforce the rule of law.
In February, the PACE called on the Ukrainian authorities to release fifteen individuals
still being held in pre-trial detention since their arrest during anti-presidential
demonstrations in March 2001. A European Commission against Racism
and Intolerance report, published in July, highlighted continued direct and indirect
discrimination, particularly by police, against Crimean Tartars,Roma,immigrants,
and refugees, and recommended a number of measures to be taken to address the
shortcomings identified. Such measures included the adoption of a comprehensive
anti-discrimination law and awareness-raising among both state authorities and
the general public about issues relating to racism and discrimination and relevant
international standards.
Ukraine finally agreed to the publication of the Committee for the Prevention
of Torture’s (CPT) 1998-2000 reports. The reports cited numerous allegations of
physical ill-treatment of detainees, criticized the poor conditions of holding facilities,
and expressed particular concern over the treatment of prisoners sentenced to
life imprisonment. The CPT visited Ukraine again toward the end of 2002.
European Union
In its annual report on human rights the E.U. stated concerns about the problematic
environment for the media in Ukraine and stressed the need to ensure a
secure environment for journalists. In its 2002-03 National Indicative Programme
for Ukraine, the E.U. highlighted the strengthening of independent mass media, the
judiciary, and public administration, and the reduction of poverty as key priorities,
together with border security and trade issues. The European Initiative for Democracy
and Human Rights identified Ukraine as a focus country for 2002-04.
A joint statement issued on the occasion of the E.U.-Ukraine summit in July
“welcomed progress made by Ukraine toward meeting OSCE and Council of
Europe standards,”“agreed that the strengthening and stability of institutions guaranteeing
democracy, rule of law and market economy is of vital importance for
Ukraine’s development and for an intensified relationship with the E.U.,”and “confirmed
[the two parties’] joint desire to further reinforce our strategic partnership
aimed at promoting stability and prosperity in Europe as well as the strengthening
of democracy, respect of human rights, rule of law and market economy.”However,
responding to President Kuchma’s expression, at the World Economic Forum in
September, of Ukraine’s E.U. membership ambitions, E.U. Commissioner for
Enlargement Günter Verheugen stated that Ukraine’s accession was not likely.
United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
In advance of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) delegation’s visit to
Kiev in July, President Kuchma announced Ukraine’s desire to seek full membership
in the alliance, although no substantive changes in the existing distinct partnership
were made. Ukraine’s relations with NATO and the U.S. deteriorated in
September, however, after the U.S. confirmed earlier that month that President
Kuchma had approved the sale of radar systems to Iraq in 2000. In order to avoid
further harm to the NATO-Ukraine relationship, the alliance refused to invite Kuchma to participate in the meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council at NATO’s
Prague summit in November by downgrading scheduled meetings to the foreign
minister level.The U.S. suspended U.S.$54 million in aid to the central government
and said it would consider further measures pending the outcome of an investigation.
The U.S. also initiated a full review of U.S. policy toward Ukraine and worked
to downgrade Ukraine’s participation in the Community of Democracies.
