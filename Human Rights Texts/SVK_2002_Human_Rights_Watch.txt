SLOVAKIA
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Slovakia made progress during 2001 in its efforts to join the first wave of candidate
countries for European Union accession, but its human rights record
remained uneven. Roma faced continued violence, discrimination, and police
abuse, occasionally with fatal consequences. The state response to discrimination
was inadequate,with Roma, gays and lesbians, and domestic violence victims lacking
full legal protection. A punitive criminal defamation law impinged on free
expression. Reforms were also needed to curb the trade in weapons with human
rights abusers.
The July death of a Roma man in police custody demonstrated the vulnerability
of Slovakia’s Roma population. The deceased,Karol Sendrei, and his two sons were
detained after a July 5 altercation between Sendrei and the local mayor in Magnezitovce,
in which the mayor and his police-officer son seriously assaulted Sendrei.
Following their arrest, Sendrei and his sons were handcuffed to a radiator at the
police station in nearby Revuca and beaten throughout the night. Sendrei died
from his wounds. Seven people were arrested in connection with the incident,
including the mayor and his son,who were charged with causing the death, and two
other police officers who face abuse of power charges.
Despite the arrests and assurances from the interior minister that he would ensure that justice would be done and improve police training, Sendrei’s death was
part of a continuing pattern of police failure to prevent racist violence against Slovak
Roma. In a week of incidents, racist gang members beat and harassed Roma in
the town of Holic, culminating in an August 13 assault on Milan Daniel that left
him needing brain surgery. Roma residents asserted that the police had failed to
protect them despite repeated complaints. On August 20, police finally charged two
youths with the attack on Daniel. On August 30, Peter Bandur was sentenced to
seven years’ imprisonment for his part in the beating death of a Roma woman,
Anastazia Balasova, a year earlier. (See Human Right Watch World Report 2001.)
While Bandur was convicted of the more serious crime of racially motivated
assault, his two accomplices received three and five years respectively for simple
assault (without racist intent).
Roma continued to face discrimination in employment, education, and housing.
Hostility on the part of other Slovaks formed part of the problem: a government
plan to resettle five homeless Roma families in Medzilaborce was met in
February by a protest petition signed by around 2,000 of the town’s residents. But
the government also failed adequately to implement and fund legal and policy
measures to combat anti-Roma discrimination. Positive developments came in the
form of the replacement in June of Vincent Danihel, the much-criticized minister
for Roma issues, by Klara Orgovanova, and the appointment of Roma parliamentarian
Ladislav Fizik as advisor to the interior minster.
Equal treatment for gays and lesbians suffered a setback on July 2, when the
National Council (parliament) rejected a proposal prohibiting employment discrimination
on the grounds of sexual orientation. There was some progress in official
recognition of the rights of national minorities, demonstrated by Slovakia’s
signing of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages on February
20 and expanded Hungarian-language teaching. Antagonism toward minorities
remained, however, with the desecration of Hungarian monuments in Kosice in
March and Jewish tombstones in Zvolen in July. Anti-domestic violence laws
remained inadequate, although the Alliance for Women cooperated with a government
criminal law reform committee in efforts to remedy the shortcomings. Victims
of rape faced bias in the justice system. Slovakia continued to lack an
ombudsman office, although the government approved a draft law creating the
post on September 19.At time of this writing,Parliament had yet to vote on the legislation.
Free expression continued to mature in Slovakia, but government officials’ use
of a criminal defamation law against journalists raised ongoing concerns. The
office of the Slovak president brought a criminal defamation suit brought against
Ales Kratky, a journalist with the daily Novy Cas, over an article questioning the
president’s fitness for office, leading to formal charges by a state prosecutor on July
2. Kratky faced a prison sentence if convicted. On July 12, the European Court of
Human Rights found that a Slovak court’s 1992 conviction of writer Lubomir
Feldek under the same law, for an article about a government official’s war record,
was a violation of Feldek’s right to free expression under article 10 of the European
Convention on Human Rights.
Slovakia’s growing popularity as a transit country for asylum seekers and migrants and a country of origin and transit for trafficking accentuated its significant
shortcomings in refugee and trafficking policy. Principal concerns were the
continued lack of an appeal mechanism for asylum petitions, lack of adequate facilities
to house asylum-seekers, and inadequate guarantees against return to a
country where individuals face threat of persecution.
Slovakia continued to authorize weapons transfers that risked fueling human
rights abuses in recipient countries. For example, it continued to be a major supplier
of arms to the highly abusive Angolan government, supplying mostly surplus
weapons made redundant by military modernization plans linked to Slovakia’s
NATO aspirations.United Nations investigators found that Slovakia was the point
of origin of weapons that were funneled to Liberia, in violation of a mandatory
arms embargo. In addition, Slovakia played a role as a transit country for arms
shipments originating in other countries. A weapons shipment from Iran apparently
destined for Angola via Slovakia and Israel was impounded at Bratislava airport
in September because the cargo was wrongly declared.The Slovak government
at this writing had not taken action to close a legal loophole that permits weapons
to transit through the country for up to seven days without a government license,
nor to incorporate in national law minimum export criteria agreed under the 1998
E.U. Code of Conduct and a November 2000 OSCE agreement on small arms. Slovakia,
a state party to the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, announced on October 18, 2000,
that it had completed destruction of its stockpile of antipersonnel landmines.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
There were no reports of interference with the work of domestic monitoring or
international human rights monitors. In March 2001, the Slovak Helsinki Committee
initiated a project to monitor news reporting on minorities. Initial findings
were encouraging,with more than 75 percent of news reporting on Roma and ethnic
Hungarians assessed as neutral. The European Roma Rights Center continued
their efforts to secure civil rights for Slovak Roma, filing suit against Slovakia in the
European Court of Human Rights on October 5 on behalf of Lubomir Sarissky, a
Roma man who died in police custody in August 1999.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
In May, the Committee against Torture considered Slovakia’s initial report on
compliance with the Convention against Torture. The committee expressed concern
at police involvement in attacks on Roma, allegations of ill-treatment of
detainees in police custody, and the failure of Slovak authorities adequately to
respond to police misconduct. The special rapporteur on the independence of
judges and lawyers, Dato’Param Cumaraswamy, visited Slovakia in November 2000
to investigate government attempts to remove the president of the Supreme Court, Dr. Stefan Harabin, in light of ongoing concerns about political interference in the
judiciary. The government proposal to remove Dr. Harabin was subsequently
defeated by the National Council in December 2000.
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
The death of Karol Sendrei while in police custody was condemned in July by the
OSCE contact point for Roma and Sinti. The contact point, Nicolae Gheorghe,
emphasized the importance of an effective investigation by the Interior Ministry.
Council of Europe
In addition to signing the minority languages charter (see above) in February,
Slovakia allowed publication on July 6 of the Opinion on Slovakia by the Advisory
Committee on the Framework Convention on the Protection of National Minorities.
The opinion, adopted by the committee in September 2000, noted progress in
Slovakia’s compliance with the convention but expressed concern about the treatment
of Roma.Similar concerns were highlighted by Human Rights Commissioner
Alvaro Gil Robles while visiting a Roma settlement in Kosice during his May trip to
Slovakia.
European Union
E.U. concern over the plight of Roma remained a sticking point in relations with
Slovakia during 2001. After visiting a Roma settlement in Jarovnice during a February
trip to Slovakia, E.U. Enlargement Commissioner Guenther Verheugen contrasted
Slovakia’s overall progress towards accession with its continued
discrimination against Roma. The European Parliament’s rapporteur on Slovakia,
Jan Marinus Wiersma, condemned the death of Karol Sendrei. Discrimination
against Roma was also noted in Wiersma’s May 8 report to the Parliament’s Foreign
Affairs Committee on Slovakia’s membership application and the related resolution
adopted by the full Parliament on September 5. In its regular report on Slovakia’s
progress toward E.U. accession released in November 2001, the European
Commission noted continued concerns about the slow implementation of programs
designed to assist Roma.
United States
The State Department country report on human rights practices in Slovakia
largely reflected the main developments during 2000, including trafficking,
although Slovakia was omitted from the department’s July global report on trafficking.
The U.S. government’s interagency Helsinki Commission maintained its
scrutiny of Slovakia’s record on Roma issues.
