 SEYCHELLES
 With the promulgation of a new Constitution, effective
 June 5, 1979, Seychelles became a de jure socialist,
 one-party state. For the previous two years, the country
 had been ruled by decree by France Albert Rene, who took
 power after a June, 1977 coup; he was elected President in
 late June, 1979 under provisions of the newly promulgated
 Constitution. Under Rene's leadership, the Government has
 continued to stress social and economic reforms aimed at
 narrowing present disparities caused by unequal income
 distribution. A People's Assembly (Legislature) created by
 the new Constitution has also been elected and has begun to
 function.   The new Constitution contains no specific Bill
 of Rights, but the protection of individual liberties is set
 forth in the Constitution's preamble as an "intention" of
 the people. Under the new Constitution, effective legal
 safeguards against arbitrary action by the executive
 are minimal, and traditional civil liberties exist at the
 sufferance of the Government.
 The Rene Government has devoted far greater attention and
 resources than its predecessor to internal and external
 security. Individuals suspected of opposition activities
 have been subject to surveillance, search, interrogation,
 and arbitrary arrest. While no Seychelles citizens were in-
 carcerated or otherwise detained for political reasons from
 July 1978 to October 1979, 70 to 130 individuals were arrest-
 ed in November in a crackdown on the political opposition.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The Preamble to the Constitution of Seychelles states
 that it is the "intention" of the people of Seychelles
 to secure the right not to be subjected to torture.
 There have been no allegations of torture in Seychelles.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Preamble also states the people's intention to secure
 the right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading
 treatment. While there have been no allegations of cruel,
 inhuman or degrading treatment of prisoners in 1979, at
 least two individuals have been beaten by government
 supporters for alleged political activity.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 As a result of heightened concern about a possible mer-
 cenary-led counter-coup attempt and increased internal
 dissension, the Government issued expanded public security
 regulations in May, 1979, and again in November 1979. These
 regulations considerably expand its authority to detain
 suspects without filing charges and to control the move-
 ment of designated individuals.

 The new Constitution imposes no restraints on the President
 in carrying out his responsibilities. Nor is the judiciary,
 which is comprised largely of expatriates recruited on
 short-term contracts, given the power to protect the indi-
 vidual against abuses by the state. Thus, there are no
 effective, legal safeguards against instances of arbitrary
 arrest or imprisonment which might arise in the future.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 With the exception of a Belgian mercenary arrested in April
 and subsequently held under the new public security regula-
 tions after their promulgation, there were no known incidents
 in 1979 involving denial of a fair public trial in Sey-
 chelles. It is yet unclear if the Seychelles Government
 will try those individuals arrested in November.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Shortly after its installation in power, the Rene regime
 accorded broad new powers to the Seychelles'police, includ-
 ing rights of search, seizure and arrest without warrant.
 These powers have been used sparingly, but no effective
 legal safeguards exist against arbitrary invasion of the
 home.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 With the construction of an international airport in
 1971, tourism rapidly replaced plantation agriculture
 as the dominant industry of Seychelles. The Government
 is making major efforts to improve agriculture and to
 develop a commercial fishing industry in order to reduce
 unemployment, agricultural imports, and dependence on the
 tourist industry. Income distribution is unequal;
 two-thirds of the labor force have incomes below the
 national average. One-third of the potential labor
 force is either unemployed or under-employed. Corrup-
 tion is not a significant problem. Tax revenues are
 derived primarily from income, import, and turnover
 taxes.
 The Rene regime's policies and budget priorities are
 directed toward improving the quality of life of the
 poor. The Government's priority is an accelerated low-cost
 housing scheme. To date, some 1,000 low-income families
 (seven percent of the population) have benefitted from this
 program. The Rene regime has also introduced educational
 measures designed to provide eight years of free, standard
 schooling to all children. Considerable opposition exists
 against Government plans to create a National Youth Service.
 It is unclear if the Government intends to move forward with
 this program, faced with broad public opposition. In March,
 1979, the Government established a social security scheme
 providing for a transfer of resources from wealthier and
 employed elements of the population to the poorest, unem-
 ployed, and elderly.   The Government plans to abolish
 private medical practice in January, 1980 and provide equal
 medical treatment to all citizens regardless of means.

 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 In October 1979, the only local publication concerned
 with political commentary was closed. The Government has
 also actively attempted to suppress an underground publica-
 tion calling for its overthrow. In November the Government
 enacted amendments to the penal code which provide for
 the imprisonment for three years of "any person who pub-
 lishes, whether orally or in writing or otherwise, any
 statement, rumor or report which is likely to cause fear and
 alarm to the public or disturb the public peace" or "any
 person who with intent to bring the President into hatred,
 ridicule, or contempt who publishes any defamatory or
 insulting matter whether in writing, print, word of mouth or
 in any other manner." The Government also issued regula-
 tions which allows the President to prohibit publications on
 the grounds of public security and which provides for
 imprisonment for two years for any person who "prints,
 makes, imports, publishes, sells, supplies, offers for
 sale or supply, distributes, reproduces or has in his
 possession or under his control any prohibited publication."
 Freedom of religion is not curtailed.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within .he Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration.
 There are no restrictions on internal or foreign travel
 or on emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The new Constitution establishes Seychelles as a one-party
 state, designates the ruling Seychelles People's Progressive
 Front (SPPF) as the only lawful party, and restricts lawful
 political activity to the party or organs of the Govern-
 ment. All members of the deposed ruling party (SDP) were
 invited to join the SPPF. Many did, and fully one-third of
 the newly elected members of the People's Assembly were
 formerly associated with the SDP. Although there was no
 referendum on the new Constitution, over 90 percent of
 eligible voters participated in the June, 1979 election,
 which gave President Rene a clear popular endorsement.
 Notwithstanding this mandate, the political rights of those
 in Seychelles opposed to single-party Government, socialism,
 or the present Government and its policies are still limited.
 The Constitution of the SPPF prohibits discrimination
 on the basis of sex, and women play an active and growing
 role in party and governmental affairs. There is no appar-
 ent discrimination based on sex in Seychelles national
 life. Women occupy prominent positions in the political
 party and the Government. The labor movement in Seychelles
 is closely tied and subordinate to the political party. The
 Government protects the freedom to organize and the right to
 equal employment opportunities, but strikes are illegal and
 basic wage rates are fixed by the Government in consul-
 tation with employers and the National Workers Union.
 Forced labor does not exist in Seychelles.

 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The Government invited Amnesty International to visit
 Seychelles in response to an inquiry from the organiza-
 tion concerning the detention in April, 1978 of 21 persons
 charged with plotting a coup. The detainees were released
 from prison before arrangements for a visit were made. The
 Government permitted independent local journalists and an
 Australian television news team to visit the detainees while
 they were being held. To the knowledge of the Department of
 State, there were no other inquiries by other international
 human rights organizations in 1978 or 1979.
