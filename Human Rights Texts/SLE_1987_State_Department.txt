 SIERRA LEONE
 Sierra Leone has a one-party system of government with the
 President exercising predominant executive authority. The
 1978 Constitution, approved in a national referendum,
 establAhed the All People's Congress (APC) as the country's
 sole legal political party. Major General Joseph Saidu Momoh
 assumed power on November 28, 1985, following a national
 referendum, confirming his designation by the APC for the
 Presidency.
 The government security structure, which includes the police,
 the military forces, and the Special Security Division,
 generally does not interfere with the rights of individuals.
 In October, however, a number of soldiers attacked workers at
 a powet generating plant, allegedly because they believed the
 workers were deliberately denying electricity to the military.
 Senior military officials apologized for the incident and
 promised an investigation and punishment for those involved.
 Sierra Leone is considered by the United Nations to be among
 the world's least developed countries. About 70 percent of
 its 3.9 million population is engaged in agriculture, mainly
 at the subsistence level. Mineral exports, notably diamonds,
 are the principal foreign exchange earner. The Constitution
 recognizes-the right of the individual to own private, property.
 Most of the modern sector of the economy is privately owned,
 but there is government ownership in certain key sectors,
 particularly-transportation and mining. Economic austerity
 measures initiated in July 1986 were abandoned early in 1987,
 and economic conditions, notably in diamond production and
 prices, have continued to deteriorate. In November the
 President declared a state .of economic emergency and proposed
 a series of sweeping measures, e.g., measures to prevent
 hoarding and smuggling of precious minerals and to-punish
 severely those involved in government corruption.
 In 1987 the major event influencing the human rights climate
 was the President's economic emergency program. Reportedly,
 the Government has moved slowly in introducing this program in
 order to protect constitutional rights, but the emergency
 gives the Government broad new powers in a number of sensitive
 areas, e.g., in detaining and controlling the movements of
 people, and limiting press reporting. The Government created
 a special commission to investigate the high number of prisoner
 deaths due to malnutrition and disease. In March an alleged
 coup plot against, the Momoh Government was uncovered. The
 Government charged that a former senior police official
 conspired with the then First Vice President and -a prominent
 businessman to assassinate the President. Eighteen persons
 were tried and found guilty of treason; 16 were sentenced to
 death.. The verdicts were being appealed at the end of 1987.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 ï¿½ Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 / There were no reports of- abduction of individuals by the
 Government or hostage-taking by nongovernmental groups.

 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were no specific reports of torture in 1987. Harsh
 physical treatment of prisoners by police, however, is thought
 to be common. Conditions in the prisons are poor, and deaths
 due to malnutrition, pneumonia, diarrhea, and gastroenteritis
 are said by journalists and lawyers to be common. Amnesty
 International issued a report in 1987 making similar
 allegations. Subsequently, the President appointed a special
 panel to investigate prison conditions. It had not reported
 its findings by the end of the year.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The President's new economic emergency measures, which were
 announced in November, gave the Government new powers to deal
 with smugglers and hoarders of currency and commodities.
 Their impact on judicial procedures and the forced movement of
 people was still not clear at the end of 1987.
 Judicial review of arrests is part of Sierra Leone common law
 and generally observed in practice. It is widely charged,
 however, particularly in Sierra Leonean legal circles, that
 police, as a form of harassment, sometimes detain persons for
 short periods without charge or judicial review. Under normal
 circumstances, detainees not charged with an offense within 28
 days of arrest must be released. During a state of emergency,
 however, the Public Emergency Act comes into effect, and
 persons detained under its provisions are not guaranteed a
 hearing unless charged with a capital offense. (The economic
 emergency measures enacted in 1987 do not fall under the
 Public Emergency Act.) No one was being detained under Public
 Emergency regulations at the end of 1987. Under the
 Constitution, the President may take measures to detain any
 person who is, or is reasonably suspected to be, dangerous to
 the well-being of the Republic.
 Neither exile nor forced labor is practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system comprises a Supreme Court of Appeals and a
 High Court of Justice, with judges appointed by the President,
 and magistrates courts. Local courts administer traditional
 law, with lay judges and procedures that do not require legal
 counsel.
 The judiciary has generally maintained its independence,
 although some critics charge that the legal system is
 increasingly subject to political manipulation, often before
 cases reach the courts, and that it has also been penetrated
 by corruption. Sierra Leone's courts generally have a
 reputation for providing fair public trials. Defendants are
 allowed counsel of their choice, and convictions may be
 appealed. Many defendants, however, cannot afford counsel,
 and a public defender is provided only in capital offense
 cases.
 There are no known political prisoners. The 1987 coup trial
 which involved the former First Vice President, Francis M.
 .Minah, and 17 others--largely from Mr. Minah's Pujehun
 district--was conducted in the High Court of Justice and was
 open to the public. The defendants-had legal counsel and were
 given adequate time to prepare their cases and call witnesses.
 
 
 259
 SIERRA LEONE
 The death sentence verdicts in 16 of the 18 cases were under
 appeal to the Court of Appeals at the end of 1987. According
 to attorneys defending the persons charged in the coup trial,
 the proceedings were--to all outward appearances--fair, but
 they believe a number of rulings were subtly biased in favor
 of the.prosecution.
 While the handling of the 1987 coup case--from arrest to
 trial--moved expeditiously, this is not true of most cases.
 The legal system is heavily overburdened and lacks resources.
 This results in an average delay of 2 ypars before a case
 actually comes to trial. The only official records of
 proceedings are handwritten notes taken by the judges. This
 practice limits lawyers' access to written documentation and
 puts ih question the impartiality of the official record.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence,
 The State does not generally interfere with rights of privacy
 and family, and, legal safeguards against arbitrary invasion of
 the home are usually observed. Neither censorship of mail nor
 electronic eavesdropping by the State on priyate conversations
 have been reported. Some organizations, however, have claimed
 that informers report to the Government on their activities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although freedom of speech is legally guaranteed, this can be
 abridged under the Constitution'if the proper functioning of
 the Government is deemed to be in jeopardy. In practice, the
 Government generally tolerates public criticism by citizens,
 .and academic freedom is respected. Political propaganda
 occasionally circulates within the country from opposition
 groups based in Western Europe or the United States.
 There has been no prior government censorship of the press.
 Newspapers have reported on sensitive political topics such as
 misuse of government funds., bribery, and bureaucratic
 indiscipline. The press has been particularly active in
 uncovering corruption since the Government began an
 anticorruption campaign in July. Journalists fear, however,
 that the economic eiiergency regulations adopted in November
 will affect press freedom adversely. Those regulations
 provide for prison sentences up to 5 years and fines up to
 5,000 leones ($217) for publication of any false statement
 calculated to bring another person into disrepute, or any
 statement in a newspaper (regardless of its truth) that is
 likely to alarm the public, disturb the peace, or stir up
 feelings of ill-will among ethnic or religious groups. Even
 prior to these new regulations journalists exercised self-
 censorship. For example, most editors avoid publishing
 articles portraying the country in a critical light or
 attacking the Head of State personally. This approach is
 codified in the Newspaper Act of 1983, which specifies
 qualification standards for editors and sets a fee for
 registration of newspapers.
 In 1987 one editor was detained for 4 days on the orders of
 the First Vice President who objected to an article speculating
 that he would be removed. The editor was released after the
 Sierra Leone Association of Journalists protested the detention
 to the President.

 SIERRA LEONE
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of freedom of assembly
 and permits the formation of and membership in trade unions or
 other economic, social, or professional associations. These
 rights, however, are limited, most significantly where assembly
 or association would conflict with the "proper functioning of
 the party" or with public order. In practice, freedom of
 association in the nonpolitical sphere is respected. Private
 associations of citizens can and do make representations to
 the Government on policy issues and are not subject to
 reprisals.
 There has been a long history of trade unions in Sierra Leone.
 Labor has the right to organize into unions, to recruit
 members, and to bargain collectively with employers. Most
 sectors of the modern economy are unionized. Labor is also
 permitted to strike, and there have been a number of strikes
 and other forms of industrial action in recent years, most
 recently a teachers' work slowdown in 1987. Unions also have
 the right to join confederations. The Government has favored
 one confederation, the Sierra Leone Labor Congress (SLCC), to
 which most unions now belong. The Head of the SLCC is a
 member of the party and a Member of Parliament. The SLCC
 participates in the Sierra Leone delegation to the
 International Labor Organization meetings and is a member of
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is a tradition of religious tolerance in Sierra Leone.
 Muslims (the largest religious group), Christians, animists,
 and adherents of other faiths practice their religions freely
 and publish religious documents without government
 interference.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The President's economic emergency program will, when
 implemented, affect the freedom of movement of people, e.g.,
 in being able to shift people to other areas if orderly
 administrative and economic needs dictate. Heretofore, the
 only official control on travel within the country has been in
 diamond-mining areas where restrictions are intended to control
 smuggling. There are few regulations restricting foreign
 travel. Sierra Leone, a party to the U.N. Convention and
 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, is host to
 approximately 200 refugees, most of whom are students from
 Namibia. There were no reported incidents of forced
 repatriation in 1987.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The right of citizens to change their government is limited by
 the fact that Sierra Leone is a one-party state, although
 local party members have some say in the designation of
 candidates. Former President Stevens was the dominant
 authority in Sierra Leone until 1985, when he retired and
 arranged for his succession by Major General Momoh. The
 Parliament, at Stevens' behest, amended the Constitution to
 allow Momoh to become President without resigning his military
 commission, and in August of that year the single party, the
 All Peoples' Congress, under the control of Stevens, nominated
 
 
 261
 SIERRA LEONE
 Momoh as President. Since independence in 1961, the clear
 trend in political development has been to increase executive
 power and decrease constitutional checks on that power. The
 Constitution provides that the leader of the party will be the
 sole candidate for the office of President. The Cabinet,
 selected by the President from elected as well as appointed
 members of Parliament, meets with the President regularly and
 is a key advisory body.
 The Parliament is subservient to the executive branch of the
 Government. Candidates for Parliament are chosen in each
 constituency by the party's local executive committee, which
 selects three candidates from the list of citizens who seek
 nomination. The Central Committee of the party has the power
 to dishpprove the nomination of any candidate selected by the
 local party executive if it believes,that candidacy would be
 inimical, to the State. Parliamentary elections were last held
 in May 1986 and were accompanied by less campaign violence
 than in any election since 1977. While there were problems in.
 some constituencies, these were redressed in many cases by
 repolling or, in seven disputed races, in the courts. There
 is universal suffrage.
 In addition to the national political system, a traditional
 system of local government operates in the provinces.
 Paramount chiefs are elected for life by the members of local
 chiefdom councils. The paramount chiefs retain considerable
 authority in local affairs and in resolving-traditional
 disputes.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government generally has taken a positive attitude toward
 international and nongovernmental groups involved in
 monitoring human rights violations. In response to the 1987
 Amnesty International report, President Momoh convened a
 special commission to investigate possible human rights
 violations in the prisons.
 The Government has not interfered with the activities of the
 Sierra Leone Bar Association's Society for the Preservation of
 Human Rights This Society, founded in 1985, is supported by
 .Members of Parliament, judges, medical doctors, academics,
 civil servants, trade unionists, and the media. The Society
 won its first major court case in 1986, obtaining the
 acquittal of a group arrested for demonstrating peacefully.
 Local chapters of Amnesty International also exist.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no officially sanctioned discrimination on the basis
 of race, sex, religion, language, or social status. Members
 of Sierra*Leone's various ethnic and religious groups interact
 peacefully and are represented at all levels of the Government.
 Women in Sierra Leone are guaranteed equal rights by the
 Constitution, but their status varies widely in different
 parts of the country and depends heavily upon the cultural
 values of various tribal groups. In most rural areas, women
 are involved in farming. In some areas of Sierra Leone women
 have been elected to the prestigious position of paramount
 chief. The Government continues to be male-dominated. In the
 
 
 262
 SIERRA LEONE
 Parliament elected in 1986, only 5 of the 112 members are
 women. However, women are prominent in some professions, and
 one woman is a Supreme Court justice.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The normal workweek is 38 1/2 hours (7 hours on each of the 5
 weekdays and 3 1/2 hours on Saturdays). An established code
 sets out acceptable standards for the workplace, covering
 maintenance of machinery, safety procedures, and sanitary
 conditions. In actual practice, however, manufacturing
 concerns in Sierra Leone, of which there are very few,
 probably do not conform to the code, and there is no
 practicable means of enforcing it. There is no minimum age
 for the employment of children. Sierra Leone has no
 legislated minimum wage, although the Ministry of Labour is
 considering such a proposal. Outside the public sector there
 are no comprehensive wage or salary guidelines.
