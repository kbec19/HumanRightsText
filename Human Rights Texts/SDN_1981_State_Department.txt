 SUDAN
 The Nimeiri regime is now in its thirteenth year, having
 come to power through a military coup in May 1969. General
 Nimeiri was elected president of Sudan in a referendum held in
 October 1971. He subsequently dissolved the revolutionary
 command council, transferring many of its members and powers
 to the general secretariat of the newly-created Sudanese
 Socialist Union (SSU), Sudan's only legal party. President
 Nimeiri, who was reelected in May 1977 for a term ending in
 May 1983, serves as president and secretary general of the
 SSU.
 A people's national assembly of 207 members was elected in
 1972 to draft a constitution, which was promulgated in May 8,
 1973, at which time a new assembly was also elected. Half of
 its 250 members were elected on the basis of geographical
 representation, 100 were selected by various worker groups and
 mass organizations, and 25 were appointed by the president.
 In February 1980, the assembly was increased to 368 members,
 with the new seats being allocated principally to organized
 labor, farmers and other occupational interest groups. In
 October 1981, President Nimeiri dissolved the national assembly
 as part of the decentralization process. Elections for a new
 assembly were held in mid-December 1981. The new assembly
 will consider foreign policy, defense, and other national
 interests but President Nimeiri tetains the real decision
 making power. The southern regional assembly was also dis-
 solved in October. It will not be reconstituted until a
 referendem is held in 1982 which will decide whether the
 southern region will be decentralized into two or more regions
 along the same lines as the northern part of the country.
 Internally, Sudan continued to actively pursue a policy
 of decentralized government. In May, assemblies for the
 five new northern regions were elected in open and peaceful
 elections. Although the elections were held within the
 framework of the "nonpartisan" Sudanese Socialist Union
 (SSU), the country's only legal party, there were competing
 candidates and there is no evidence that candidates had
 been excluded for not being SSU members or that voters had
 been intimidated. These assemblies will consider educational,
 cultural and other regional interests.
 Sudan continues to face a worsening economic situation,
 exacerbated by the continued presence of about 500,000 refu-
 gees, provocations from Libya, and possible threats to internal
 stability and security. Sudan's chronic shortage of foreign
 exchange earnings deteriorated further in 1981 by the collapse
 of the three year International Monetary Fund extended fund
 facility due to Sudan's inability to meet program targets.
 Negotiations for a one-year standby arrangement were begun in
 October. In early November, President Nimeiri announced
 an 80 percent currency devaluation and the elimination or
 reduction of subsidies on several basic consumer items.
 In addition to being hard-pressed economically, Sudan faced
 increased military and political pressures. In September,
 Libya began a series of air attacks in western Sudan which
 ended in November when Libya withdrew its forces from Chad.

 The assassination of Egypt's President Sadat further raised
 tensions in the area. The recent tripartite agreement between
 Libya, Ethiopia and the Peoples Democratic Republic of Yemen
 is new foreign policy concern for Sudan.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Charges of torture have surfaced occasionally but there are
 no reports of instances in 1981. The Sudanese government has
 taken past allegations seriously and responded to them. The
 Sudanese constitution specifically prohibits torture or
 intimidation of accused persons.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.
 Sudanese penal authorities do not systematically abuse or
 degrade prisoners. The constitution says that no person shall
 be subjected to unusual or inhuman treatment or punishment.
 However, prisons and other detention facilities are austere,
 reflecting Sudan's acute poverty. For example, the lack of
 adequate prison facilities in Khartoum and other urban areas
 during the September round-up of jobless and illegal residents
 caused the government temporarily to house detainees in
 stadiums and other large compounds. According to credible but
 unsubstantiated reports, shortages of food, water, and shelter
 caused suffering in some instances. In addition, southern
 prisoners frequently charge that police and jailors in the
 north abuse them, but the mistreatment likely stems from
 personal prejudice rather than government policy.
 c. Disappearances
 There were no reported cases of politically inspired dis-
 appearances in Sudan during 1981.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Sudanese law contains protections against arbitrary arrests.
 It provides the right of habeas corpus, and the courts, as
 part of normal practice, dismiss charges for lack of sufficient
 evidence or direct the release of prisoners on bail. Nonethe-
 less, some arrests of varying degrees of arbitrariness have
 occurred. Amnesty International has reported that, as of
 April 1981, about 300 people arbitrarily arrested for political
 reasons are believed to be under detention.
 In June, President Nimeiri ordered the arrest of the leadership
 of the Sudanese Railway Workers Federation because of the
 union's illegal strike which the government believed to be a
 threat to national security. Most leaders were released a few
 weeks later as part of a "spirit of Ramadan' amnesty, but the
 government reportedly has continued to detain those who may
 have been affiliated with the banned Sudanese Communist Party.
 In mid-September, the police began arresting and screening
 Sudanese, aliens and refugees in urban centers who did not
 have permission to reside and work there. It is estimated
 that as of the end of October 1981, at least 20,000 persons
 had been detained and screened. Approximately 5,000 of these
 
 
 266
 were expelled from the cities while 1,000 were incarcerated,
 usually for alleged security reasons. Sudanese detainees
 had four days to produce legal proof of residence and employ-
 ment or be sent to their home region or to an agricultural
 project. Refugees without documentation were returned to
 their camps and illegal aliens were deported. Individual
 members of the Khartoum Bar Association protested the policy
 as a violation of the Sudanese constitution's provision that
 "freedom of movement and residence shall be guaranteed for all
 citizens except for reasons of security and public health."
 The government dismissed this objection, arguing that the
 resultant decrease in urban crime, lessening of the pressure
 on urban food supplies and reduction of the danger of urban
 unrest justified the measures taken.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Public trials by civilian courts are the rule. However,
 there has been some erosion of this legal safeguard during
 the year. The railroad strike detentions and urban roundups
 both were conducted without trial. In September, the govern-
 ment also instituted special "price courts" presided over by
 military officers empowered to render summary justice (includ-
 ing fines, imprisonment or lashes) in trying merchants accused
 of violating price controls. Defendants before these courts
 have no effective mechanism for representation by counsel, or
 right of confrontation with their accusors. These quasi-
 military tribunals do not apply the rules of evidence normal
 in the civilian court system. Convictions can be appealed,
 but the requisite written trial records usually are not
 available. The trials have been public; in fact the government
 has accorded considerable publicity to them as a measure to
 cope with inflation.
 Security tribunals have sometimes been used in cases involving
 serious political charges. They convene by decision of the
 president of the republic, on the recommendation of the
 attorney general, if the president believes that the activities
 of the accused represent a clear threat to the stability of
 the state. The tribunals are usually open, but may be closed
 by decision of the chief magistrate.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 A constitutional quarantee protects the home against invasion
 and it is generally respected. The railway workers, during
 their strike, asserted that the authorities had conducted
 illegal house searches, particularly in Atbara, the strike's
 center.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution guarantees freedom of expression, religion
 and assembly. Citizens openly criticize government policies
 and they display little fear of retaliation. An example is
 the public debate between members of the Sudanese Bar
 Association and the deputy chief of state security over the
 legality of the government's urban arrest program. There is
 an unwritten understanding, however, that comments must be in
 the form of "constructive" criticism, thus, the government
 has moved to interdict tapes and pamphlets of self-exiled
 opposition leader Sharif al Hindi, whom it accuses of seeking
 
 
 267
 to overthrow the government. Any criticism of the president
 tends to be indirect, aimed either at government policies
 or the "incompetent" advice and conduct of advisors.
 The government exercises little or no direct prepublica-
 tion censorship of the press or other media. Nonetheless,
 journalists customarily Avoid extremely sensitive subjects
 because in past years a few have been arrested or fired for
 disregarding the unwritten boundaries. In July the government
 suppressed an issue of a University of Khartoum faculty
 journal for an article deemed critical of the president.
 The English language press is more independent than the
 Arabic press. The respected monthly English language magazine
 Sudanow publishes articles critical of the government, particu-
 larly its economic policies. However, it too has bounds. The
 normally topical magazine did not, for example, comment upon
 the railway workers strike until long after it had ended. It
 also handled a student strike at Juba University in a gingerly
 manner.
 There is free access to foreign newspapers, magazines and
 books, both western and Soviet, but circulation of material
 from abroad is small.
 The influential Muslim Brotherhood, whose leaders include the
 attorney general, has strongly pressed for Islamization of
 Sudanese law, though marriage, divorce, inheritance and family
 law traditionally have been governed by religious practice
 rather than secular law. Efforts to expand the jurisdiction
 of Sharia (Islamic) courts have stalled in the national
 assembly.
 Approximately one third of the population of Sudan is non-
 Muslim and the government insists that freedom of religion be
 respected. While the state gives financial support to Muslim
 sects, it does not otherwise discriminate against the large
 non-Muslim minority. Christian missionaries operate educa-
 tional projects in the non-Muslim south and confine their
 evangelism to non-Muslims in northern parts of the country.
 Any effort to convert Muslims in any part of the country would
 probably provoke official restrictions.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The constitution guarantees citizens freedom from deportation
 and exclusion from the country; however, a constitutional
 amendment in 1975 suspended protection of freedom of movement
 inside Sudan in cases of national security. Also, as noted
 earlier, the new government campaign to reduce the numbers of
 migrant Sudanese, aliens and refugees in urban centers imposes
 a further restraint on internal migration. There are no
 restrictionson the right of assembly.
 Sudan suffers from significant emigration of educated and
 trained manpower to oil-rich Middle Eastern countries. This
 emigration has reached such proportions that the government
 had attempted to curb the flow. Specialized university
 graduates, such as physicians, are under obligation to pay the
 cost of their education through a fixed term of service within
 
 
 268
 the country. Other categories of government personnel in
 short supply, such as teachers and technicians, encounter
 difficulty in obtaining exit permits.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Under the constitution, Sudan has only one party, the Sudanese
 Socialist Union (SSU). Open to any citizen able and willing
 to pay monthly dues of six cents, the party seeks to include
 all sectors of society. The electoral system requires that
 the SSU approve candidates for both the national assembly
 and the regional assemblies, though they need not belong to
 it. The SSU rejected no candidates for the May 1981 elections
 for the new regional assemblies. All candidates must run on
 non-partisan platforms.
 In October, President Nimeiri, exercising his constitutional
 emergency powers, dissolved the people's national assembly as
 a step towards reducing its size and transferring much of its
 legislative authority to the new regional assemblies. Elec-
 tions for the new assembly were held in December 1981.
 At the same time, the president dissolved the southern regional
 assembly and high executive council and appointed an interim
 government to serve until a region-wide referendum can be held
 to determine whether the proposed division of the south into
 two or more administrative regions should take place. The
 president acted in order to resolve the growing controversy
 among southerners about the desirability of the proposal. The
 referendum is to be held in early 1982.
 The Sudanese constitution empowers the president to issue
 provisional "republican decrees" in "cases of importance and
 urgency." He must, however, submit them for ratification to
 the assembly within fifteen days of promulgation if the
 assembly is in session, or at the first meeting of a new
 session if it is in recess. President Nimeiri has increas-
 ingly used this means to address major economic and political
 issues. The assembly has consistently ratified his actions.
 Under a policy of "national reconciliation,' the Nimeiri
 regime has successfully dissuaded most parties and factions
 from active opposition. The cabinet and SSU central committee
 have incorporated members of all major groups except the
 Ansar, a tribal-religious group which has fought against
 the central government in the past, and the Sudanese Communist
 Party (SCP). In the May 1981 elections for the new northern
 regional assemblies, the Ansar chose to participate, but
 neither they nor other traditional factions won more than
 fragmentary representation.
 Because parties other than the SSU are illegal, groups
 like the Ansar and Muslim Brotherhood operate informally but
 openly to look after their political interests. The govern-
 ment, at present, actively combats only the Sudanese Communist
 Party. Early this year it arrested persons accused of active
 party membership and fired government officials suspected of
 communist sympathies.
 Traditionally tolerant of strikes, the Nimeiri regime this
 past year moved to curb the political power of organized
 labor. Immediately after the railroad strike collapsed, the
 
 
 269
 president issued a republican decree prescribing the death
 penalty for organizers of strikes and long prison terms for
 persons participating in them. Apparently a tactic to deter
 resumption of the railroad strike, the decree has never been
 submitted to the national assembly for enactment into law.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 No requests in 1981 for outside investigations of alleged
 rights violations in Sudan have been reported.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances.
 Sudan is one of the world's poorest countries. The world
 Bank estimates per capita income at $370 in 1979.   In rural
 Sudan, 85 percent of the populace lives in conditions of
 poverty. In the past year, serious inflation estimated at
 20 percent or more has aggravated these difficult economic
 circumstances. In response, the government in September
 adopted a price stabilization program, including the
 previously described price courts and prosecution of persons
 accused of violating guidelines. The economic impact of these
 measures is uncertain; similar efforts previously resulted
 mainly in hoarding and black marketing and proved unable to
 halt inflation.
 President Nimeiri has stated his commitment to *development
 and progress guided by a balanced ambition for welfare and an
 honorable life in an environment of social justice." However,
 the extreme poverty of the nation, the lack of infrastructure
 and trained manpower, the inefficient bureaucracy and acute
 budgetary problems have limited advancement toward these
 goals this year.
 Two additional factors have reduced the government's ability
 to provide the social services these goals imply. Sudan
 traditionally has welcomed refugees and presently hosts
 about 500,000. Even with the assistance of international
 organizations and foreign aid, the strain on Sudanese resources
 has been substantial. Secondly, worsening relations with
 Libya have constrained the government to redirect an increasing
 portion of its budget from social and educational programs to
 national defense.
 The Sudanese constitution provides free medical care and
 education for all. The limited medical facilities available
 are concentrated in Khartoum and the east-central region of
 the country; in other areas, especially in the west and south,
 the level of health care is much lower. Infant mortality in
 1972 was estimated at 141 for 1,000 live births, and the
 national life expectancy in 1979 was estimated at 47 years.
 Though a regional breakdown of these statistics is not avail-
 able, health officials believe that mortality rates are higher
 and life expectancy lower in the west and the south than in
 the rest of the nation, reflecting greater incidence of
 disease and poverty in these areas.   Population growth,
 believed to be highest in Khartoum and the south, is estimated
 at 2.6 percent per annum over the past decade.
 The problem of providing widespread education mirrors that
 of providing adequate health care. In 1975, twenty percent
 of the nation was estimated to be literate, with the rate
 being much lower for females than for males. Using foreign
 
 
 270
 assistance as well as its own resources, the government is
 broadening educational programs at-the primary and secondary
 level. However, budgetary constraints and lack of classrooms
 have severely limited the number of students these programs
 have been able to reach. In 1978 fifty percent of primary
 school aged children (58 percent of males, 42 percent of
 females) were estimated to be receiving some form of schooling.
 Despite cultural barriers to female participation in activities
 outside the house, the national educational system selects
 through competitive examinations the best male and female
 students nation-wide for government-financed higher education.
 Universities are located in Khartoum, Wad Medani, and Juba;
 others are projected for the new northern regional capitals
 but they remain in the speculative stage.
 Transportation bottlenecks hamper the government's efforts
 to ensure adequate food supplies nationwide, and local food
 shortages resulting in instances of starvation, particularly
 in the west and south, occur from time to time.
