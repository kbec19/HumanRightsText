 TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
 Trinidad and Tobago, with a population of 1.2 million, is the
 second largest English-speaking nation in the Caribbean. It
 has a constitutional, British-style democratic government.
 About 40 percent of the population are black and urban, and
 about 40 percent are East Indian and mostly rural. The blacks
 have controlled the Government since independence in 1962.
 The political system is a multiparty democracy, in which the
 people periodically vote freely for members of the House of
 Representatives. The leader of the party with a majority in
 the house is called on, as Prime Minister, to form the
 Government. The ruling People's National Movement, which is
 largely supported by the urban black population, has won these
 general elections since 1956, but various opposition parties
 have always participated in the elections. The security
 apparatus--the defense force and the police--are under the
 control of the Government, and any claims of human rights
 violations by security forces may be taken to the courts, which
 are independent of the executive. Individuals are free to hold
 property and pursue private interests. The economy is mixed,
 with substantial government ownership and control. Although
 the economy is in many respects still a developing one, per
 capita income is at a high level because of oil revenues.
 No major changes occurred in human rights observance in 1983.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Trinidad and Tobago's record has been generally good in this
 respect. Occasionally, men wanted for common crimes have been
 shot in the course of being arrested, and critics alleged that
 excessive force was used in these cases. However, police
 investigations have concluded that the actions were warranted.
 There have been no government-sponsored killings for political
 motives.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is forbidden by law and is not practiced. The
 Constitution also forbids cruel and unusual treatment or
 punishment, and the law renders inadmissible in court any
 evidence obtained through such treatment. The law permits
 victims to sue for civil damages. Occasionally, allegations of
 mistreatment of prisoners or land squatters by the police
 surface in the courts or the media. Courts frequently find in
 favor of the complainant. Physical conditions in prisons
 remain austere.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There are no political prisoners. Any individual who is
 detained may apply to the courts for a writ of habeas corpus.
 The police usually charge a suspect within 48 hours of arrest,
 but can obtain a court order to hold a person longer, in order
 to get further evidence.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In law and in practice, accused persons are accorded a fair and
 public trial by an independent judiciary, from whom appeals may
 be made to the Court of Appeals and to the Privy Council in
 London. The judiciary and legal system are understaffed and
 overworked, which has caused long delays in bringing some
 accused persons to trial, although they may be freed on bail.
 f. ArbitraryInterference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution and laws prohibit such arbitrary interference,
 and there were no allegations of it in 1983.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 laws and generally respected in practice. Criticism of the
 Government up to the highest level is permitted, and rights of
 free expression are also protected by the independent
 judiciary, the democratic political system, and a privately
 owned print media. Trinidad and Tobago Television (TTT) and
 one of the two radio stations are publicly owned, and although
 they are financially self-supporting and their boards are
 composed of nominally impartial persons, the Government
 dominates television news coverage.
 There are credible allegations that the Government also
 influences appointments, assignments, and coverage of news
 events and developments. While ignoring a longstanding private
 application for a license for a new station, the Government in
 1983 established a second government-owned television channel.
 The Prime Minister himself publicly criticized a news report by
 the privately owned Radio Trinidad and recalled that it does
 not have a license. The Organization of National
 Reconstruction's (ONR) 1983 conference received no television
 coverage, and the ONR is suing TTT over the latter's alleged
 insistence that one of its allotted broadcasts be edited before
 it could be shown. Nonetheless, news coverage critical of the
 Government and its policies has appeared and continues to
 appear on government-owned radio and television.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are protected by the Constitution, by law, and
 in practice. Permits for street meetings must be obtained in
 advance from the-police, but are freely granted, even to
 critics of the Government.
 The right of workers'to organize unionsand bargain
 collectively is protected by the Industrial Relations Act.
 About 30 percent of the work force is organized. The Ministry
 of Labor acts as an impartial conciliator in labor disputes,
 
 
 702
 and an autonomous Industrial Court resolves disputes. Unions
 are not controlled by the Government. They are not attached to
 political parties, but some trade union leaders are also
 political leaders, and individual unions back various parties
 and have strong influence on political issues. Unions and
 professional associations maintain relations with international
 bodies.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religious belief is respected in law and practice,
 and there is no established or favored religion. Rastafarians
 and Black Muslim groups claim that they are harassed by the
 Government, but any action taken against them results from the
 fact that some of their cult beliefs, such as drug use and
 appropriating others' property, involve criminal activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution, laws, and practice permit free movement
 within Trinidad and Tobago, foreign travel, and repatriation.
 Many citizens of Trinidad and Tobago have emigrated in search
 of greater economic opportunity.  Similarly, many thousands of
 citizens of other countries, mostly from Grenada and other
 small islands of the Commonwealth Caribbean, have emigrated to
 Trinidad and Tobago. The Government has been liberal in
 permitting these people to remain legally. The Constitution
 permits Commonwealth citizens to vote, and most of these
 immigrants have tended to support the ruling party.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 The citizens of Trinidad and Tobago have the right to change
 their government through free and fair multiparty general
 elections for the House of Representatives, at least every five
 years. In accordance with the Constitution and with British
 parliamentary tradition, the leader of the party with a
 majority in the House of Representatives is called by the
 President, who is elected by the Parliament, to form a
 government. The general elections are conducted by an
 independent Elections and Boundaries Commission. The most
 recent general election, in November 1981, was won by the
 People's National Movement, as have been all general elections
 since 1956. The opposition Alliance, a three-party coalition,
 won 10 of the 36 seats and has the normal rights of an
 opposition party in a democratic parliamentary system. Under
 the winner-take-all electoral system, the winning candidate in
 each constituency is the one with a plurality of the votes. As
 a result, one party, the ONR, won 20 percent of the votes
 throughout the country but no seats in the Parliament.
 The smaller island of Tobago has a separate semiautonomous
 House of Assembly dominated by the Democratic Action Congress,
 a part of the opposition Alliance. The House of Assembly,
 which was established in 1980, depends on the central
 government for revenues. Residents of Tobago claim that this
 island does not get a fair share of the benefits of the
 country's oil-based prosperity, and talk of secession.
 On Trinidad there are also county and municipal councils with
 local powers. In the August 1983 local government elections on
 Trinidad, a coalition of ONR and Alliance opposition candidates
 won six of seven county councils while the ruling PNM retained
 control of the four municipal councils.
 
 
 703
 The PNM has over the years received most of its support from
 urban blacks, although it also has support from other ethnic
 groups, which are represented in its leadership. Most of the
 Alliance's support comes from rural East Indians.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violation
 of Human Rights
 Trinidad and Tobago has not been the subject of international
 human rights investigations. Non-governmental human rights
 organizations as well as a local branch of Amnesty
 International operate freely and openly in the country. A
 constitutionally mandated Ombudsman works to resolve individual
 citizen's complaints that their rights have been violated by
 government agencies. Claims of human rights violations may be
 taken to the courts; and the bar, the press, trade unions, and
 other organizations also take up the cause of human rights. In
 international forums Trinidad and Tobago generally supports
 human rights but does not criticize other nations by name for
 violations, nor accept human rights as a criterion for its own
 or other countries' economic assistance. In the 1983 reports,
 Amnesty International had no comment on Trinidad and Tobago,
 and Freedom House rated the country "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Because of its oil revenues, in the past decade Trinidad and
 Tobago attained a per capita gross national product of $5,257
 (1981), highest in the Western Hemisphere after the United
 States and Canada. The Central Bank says per capita gross
 domestic product in 1982 was $6,691.  The population of 1.2
 million has a growth rate of 1.5 percent a year; life
 expectancy at birth was 71 years in 1980: and infant mortality
 was 23.5 per 1,000 live births. Education and literacy are
 nearly universal; in 1970 adult literacy was 92.2 percent (male
 94.7, female 89.7) and in 1976 primary school enrollment was 96
 percent (male 96, female 97).
 Further indications of the widespread prosperity are the 96
 percent of the population with access to safe water in 1970
 (urban 100, rural 95), and the 103 percent of caloric supply
 available for consumption relative to nutritional requirements
 as of 1977.
 Women enjoy equality under the law, and many work in the
 Government and civil service, political party leadership, and
 business and professions, though not in proportion to their
 numbers in the population. There are women in Parliament and
 women's groups are quick to speak out on women's rights issues.
 Within the Indian community, remnants of the Hindu caste system
 remain. Blacks believe they are not treated as well as whites
 and those of mixed blood. Individual Tobagonians are treated
 with equality but believe that Tobago itself receives far less
 development money than Trinidad. In each case, the people
 affected perceive these conditions as limiting social and
 economic opportunities for them.
 In Trinidad, it is said that areas which historically have
 supported the ruling party have more and better roads,
 telephones, and schools than those backing opposition parties,
 and a government minister drew criticism during the local
 election campaign when he implied that the Government would
 deliberately follow such a policy in the future.
