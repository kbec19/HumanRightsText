 PERU
 
 1981 saw the continuing consolidation of democracy
 in Peru under the leadership of President Belaunde,
 who took office in July 1980 following 12 years of
 military rule. The Government of Peru has reestablished
 the civil and political liberties which the leaders
 of the *revolution" which preceded it had felt free
 to limit or, in some cases, eliminate. Respect for
 the integrity of the person was also greatly improved,
 although in this area the years of neglect of the country's
 penal and judicial systems left a legacy which could
 not be completely rectified in a year's time. Addition-
 ally, politically-motivated violence -- both the numerous
 nighttime bombings of public installations and, as
 the year drew to a close, armed attacks on police stations
 -- presented the perennial problem of effectively coping
 with a terrorist threat while preserving human rights.
 So far, the government has coped well with this dilemua.
 The year also saw the establishment of the constitu-
 tionally-mandated office of the attorney general (fiscal
 de la nacion), an independent judical ombudsman who
 is also a sort of watchdog of the supreme court. Progress
 was also made in establishing the tribunal of guarantees,
 which will rule on the constitutionality of laws and
 legislative decrees.
 Two good indicators of the healthy state of human rights
 in Peru-were the virtual absence of complaints of mistrea-
 tment of Ecuadorean residents during the border clash
 between the two countries in January and February 1981,
 and the continuing openness towards international investiga-
 tion, most notably manifested in Peru's acceptance
 of the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Human Rights
 Court.
 The government remained committed to its program of
 directing the economy toward a market-oriented system
 which, in the medium and long term, should create jobs
 and increase real income. In the short term, however,
 it has not yet appreciably improved the lot of Peru's
 poor.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There are no credible reports indicating that the govern-
 ment has condoned torture. Rather, since assuming
 power, it has placed special emphasis on respecting
 the integrity of the person. The constitution provides
 that any prisoner may ask for a court order for an
 immediate examination by a physician of choice. The
 penal code also provides for punishment of government
 officials found guilty of physically abusing a prisoner.
 There is no evidence of any systematic employment of
 torture by the police. Nevertheless, practice in this
 area has traditionally fallen short of these precepts,
 and there has been at least one well-documented case
 of torture by police of a suspected terrorist.  (The
 case is being investigated by the attorney general,
 who will, when organizational measures are complete,
 preside over the public ministry and a council which
 (512)
 
 
 513
 Will monitor the actions of the supreme court.) Police
 abuses, when they do occur, are most likely to happen
 in the initial phases of detention. For example, a
 student died of wounds inflicted during his interrogation
 following his detention for participating in street
 disturbances. The circumstances of his death are being
 investigated by the attorney general.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punish-
 ment
 This is illegal, but it does occur occasionally despite
 official efforts to curb abuse. Peruvian penal facilities
 are generally grim, overcrowded and often unsanitary.
 Many hundreds of those incarcerated have not been tried
 because of the slowness of the judicial process. The
 constitution grants prisoners the right to be held
 in healthful and adequate penal facilities, but for
 years successive Peruvian governments have not provided
 budget support for necessary improvements.
 The most serious recent incident was a brutal fight
 between two rival gangs in Lima's El Sexto Prison in
 March 1981 which resulted in some 20 deaths. Given
 budgetary priorities, no significant upgrading of prison
 conditions is likely in the near term.
 c. Disappearances
 ,There have been no charges of disappearances occurring
 in 1981.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution guarantees against arbitrary arrest.
 (Police authorities on the local level, however, some-
 times take advantage of their wide latitude to arrest
 and detain.) The constitution permits preventive deten-
 tion up to 15 days only in cases specifically involving
 terrorism, espionage or trafficking in narcotics.
 A .1981 legislative decree on terrorism reaffirmed and
 extended the constitutional safeguards due those under
 preventive detention. Similarly, while guaranteeing
 the right of habeas corpus, the constitution permits
 the government to suspend that right, among others,
 via the declaration of a state of emergency. In October
 1981 the government declared a 60-day state of emergency
 in most of the department of Ayacucho, following a
 series of violent incidents there in which terrorists
 began to extend their operations from property damage
 to the taking of lives. Human rights organizations
 have questioned the constitutionality of the 1981 legisla-
 tive decrees on terrorism and have expressed concern
 that it may enable the government arbitrarily to limit
 freedom of expression.
 Although the far left has alleged that some of its
 sympathizers have been held as political prisoners
 for six months or more, in all such cases either the
 individual in question has been released or the govern-
 ment has gone forward with charges of terrorist activity.
 As of October 1981, no one so charged had yet seen
 his case resolved.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The government is committed to support the extensive
 constitutional guarantees relating to the administration
 of justice. However, the legal system has been fraught
 with serious problems due to lack of adequate financing
 and staffing. Delays from arrest to final sentencing
 of two or more years have been comon, and corruption
 of judges reputedly occurs, especially in cases involving
 those accused of narcotics trafficking. Access to
 the full benefits of the legal system still depends
 largely upon personal financial circumstances, as free
 legal assistance exists on paper but seldom in practice.
 Efforts to expedite the workings of the Peruvian judicial
 system have intensified under the Belaunde government.
 The number of courts has been augmented, and judicial
 authorities have asked subordinate judges to work longer
 hours. Similarly, the attorney general has conscien-
 tiously striven to enhance both the quality and quantity
 of the nation's prosecutors. All this has resulted
 in some reduction of the time consumed between arrest
 and sentencing.
 While the constitution provides that a defendant has
 the right to have an interpreter present if he does
 not understand Spanish, the stress on written presenta-
 tion works to the disadvantage of the poorly-educated
 in any language.
 Capital punishment is now permitted only for treason
 in the time of war.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution guarantees the inviolability of the
 home except during a state of emergency, when police
 are permitted to enter and search homes and seize suspects
 and property without a judicial warrant. In overwhelming
 measure, this stricture has been observed, although
 there are credible reports that the civil guard has
 occasionally violated it in its anti-terrorist activities
 in some of the highland departments.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitutionally-mandated right to freedom of speech
 and the press was in full force throughout 1981, with
 journals of all political persuasions freely expressing
 their viewpoints. There was no move to impose censorship
 during the border clash with Ecuador. One ambiguous
 note was the establishment in late 1981 of a private
 professional journalists' association, which, in effect,
 will license those wishing to practice journalism in
 Peru. Although this is a widely-supported measure,
 at least one major magazine intends not to participate,
 and may challenge it in the courts.
 The constitution guarantees freedom of religion and
 conscience, and no instances of persecution for religious
 beliefs occurred during 1981. The constitution also
 guarantees freedom of assembly except in areas declared
 in a state of emergency. The government has been forth-
 
 
 515
 coming in granting permits for demonstrations and parades,
 and has dealt with many unauthorized demonstrations
 in a non-confrontational manner.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The constitution guarantees the right of free movement,
 except in a state of emergency or siege. There are
 no political or legal restraints on foreign travel
 or emigration.
 .Peru remains wary of accepting refugees for resettlement
 as a result of its experience in April 1980, when 10,000
 Cubans took refuge in its embassy in Havana. Although
 only some 742 arrived in Lima, most of these proved
 ineligible for entry to the United States and uninterested
 in residing permanently in Peru. Some 250 remain in
 a refugee camp in Lima, where they receive assistance
 both from the Peruvian government and the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees. Standard Peruvian
 policy is to facilitate the transit of refugees who
 have an established destination in a third country,
 as it did frequently in 1981 with Bolivians and in
 at least one instance with a deserting Soviet sailor.
 Aberrations, such as the issuance of tourist visas
 to many Cubans who did not have a secure onward destina-
 tion, or the precipitate return of a Cuban stowaway
 to his government, are attributed to lower-level officials
 having failed to consult with their superiors.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Universal suffrage for all Peruvians 18 years of age
 and over is provided for in the constitution. Voting
 is a duty for every eligible voter. The political
 process is completely open; thus, a coalition of far-
 left parties, including Moscow-line communists and
 self-avowed revolutionary groups, is represented in
 both houses of congress, as well-as in numerous municipal
 governments.
 The-constitution recognizes the right of workers in
 the private sector to form and join labor unions, to
 bargain collectively with employers and to strike.
 With the exception of members of the armed forces,
 public sector employees have the constitutional right
 to unionize and strike. These rights are freely exercised
 by vigorous, if divided, trade union and peasant movements.
 No major part of the labor movement is tied to or control-
 led by the government. Union leaders are consulted
 on labor policies through testimony before congressional
 committees and in high-level talks with the minister
 of labor and the president. A tripartite commission,
 with representatives from labor, the private sector
 and government, was formed in early 1981 to adjudicate
 some of the disputed details occasioned by the transition
 from military to civilian government. The commission
 has become a clearinghouse for labor policy in which
 union leaders, both communist.and democratic, play
 Sa .large role. Congress is considering a new law which
 will regulate the right to strike.
 The constitution guarantees the right of women to participate
 in the political process, and also guarantees equality
 in employment. In practice, however, very few women
 
 
 516
 occupy prominent positions in the public sector and
 relatively few in the private sector. There are no
 women members of the cabinet or the supreme court and
 only one female ambassador. Fourteen women sit in
 the 240-member Peruvian congress.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 The attitude of Peru's civilian government in this
 area has been one of complete openness. In January
 1981 it formally accepted the jurisdiction of the Inter-
 American Human Rights Courts, the second nation to
 do so. Non-governmental organizations such as Amnesty
 International operate with complete freedom in the
 country. In addition, the government has moved to
 establish such self-correction mechanisms as the attorney
 general and the tribunal of guarantees.
 4.   Social and Economic Circumstances
 The cornerstone of the economic program of the Belaunde
 government is the redirection of the economy, from
 the preceding system of state planning, which proved
 a failure, to a market-oriented system which will encourage
 private (including foreign) investment. Job creation
 and increasing real incomes -- particularly among the
 poor -- are among the highest priorities of the administration,
 but many of the country's poor have not yet experienced
 an improvement in their economic situation.
 Peru (whose 1979 per capita gross national product
 was $730) continues to be characterized by levels of
 poverty higher than the average for Latin America.
 The most recent World Bank estimate is that 49 percent
 of the urban population is below the absolute poverty
 level. Unemployment and underemployment continue to
 be in the 50 percent range. Other indicators are:
 a high level of malnutrition; an infant mortality rate
 estimated at 92 for every 1000 live births (1975);
 1978 life expectancy at birth of 56.5 (55.5 for males,
 58 for females); and a low (48.3) percentage of the
 population with access to safe water (60 percent of
 the urban population, 25 percent of the rural).
 The country's population growth rate has fallen only
 slightly in the last 20 years: It was 2.8 percent in
 1960-70 and 2.6 percent in 1970-79.
 Progress has been made in basic education. In 1972,
 the last year for which reliable figures are available,
 the adult literacy rate was 73 percent (83 percent
 for males, 62 percent for females). The adjusted primary
 school enrollment ratio in 1978 was 112 percent (116
 percent for males, 136 percent for females).
 Peru, composed of three completely distinct geographic
 regions, has been a classic case of differential development.
 There have been massive migrations from the undeveloped
 mountain region to the coast, especially to Lima, which
 has been unable to provide essential services to its
 burgeoning population. Nevertheless, living conditions
 on the whole are better in the coastal cities than
 in the highlands. For example, in 1970, when the national
 infant mortality rate was 155 per 1000 live births,
 
 
 517
 in the Cuzco province of Acomay it was 300, while in
 Lima it was 82.
 The impact of the Belaunde government's economic reform
 effort will be felt over the medium to long term.
 However, the plight of the poor will not change drastically
 in the short term. Many of the government's economic
 policies initially could have a detrimental impact
 on the poor. The removal of costly subsidies on a
 number of basic goods -- including gasoline -- is one
 example. As in prior years, expansion of health, education
 and other social services will be limited by budgetary
 constraints despite the government's commitment to
 expand them. Low world commodity prices have adversely
 affected the country's export earnings. Inflation,
 and the policies necessary to contain it, will also
 limit short-term improvement in real wages for blue
 and white collar workers; real wages for both groups
 have fallen dramatically since 1973 and began rising
 .only in 1980. Over the medium and long run, however,
 government policies should create an environment conducive
 -to: equitable-economic growth, with a corresponding
 strong, positive effect on Peru's socio-economic situation.
