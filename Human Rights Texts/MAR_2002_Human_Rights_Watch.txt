MOROCCO
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Selective acts of repression limited the liberalization process started by the late
King Hassan II and continued by his son, King Mohamed VI. Compared with previous
years, there was freer public discussion of Berber rights, the Western Sahara
conflict, and past human rights abuses.But with the occasional move to ban a newspaper,
forbid a rally, beat up protesters, or jail whistle-blowers, the government
remained the arbiter of how and when Moroccans could exercise their rights.
Speaking July 30 on the second anniversary of his accession to the throne,
Mohamed VI called for “a modern democratic state, founded on public liberties
and human rights.”But neither he nor Prime Minister Abderrahmane Youssoufi—
a former victim of repression and longtime human rights activist—proved forceful
advocates of human rights in the face of repeated violations.
The authorities frequently barred or broke up meetings or protests, using powers
provided by the Law on Public Assemblies to prevent gatherings deemed capable
of “disturbing public order,” even when they were peaceful. On January 12, the
Interior Ministry banned a demonstration called by human rights organizations
in front of Dar al-Mokri, a former secret detention center in Rabat. In June and
July, the ministry prevented Berber rights groups from holding a meeting and a
conference. It also banned a demonstration called for October 21 in Rabat against
the U.S. air strikes in Afghanistan. At other times, police sometimes tolerated,
sometimes broke up, sit-ins and rallies by workers and by groups representing the
unemployed.
Trials of over 160 demonstrators arrested when police violently dispersed rallies
on December 9 and 10, 2000 continued throughout much of the year. In the first
instance, human rights activists had planned a peaceful sit-in near the parliament
building in Rabat to demand accountability for past abusers,but police intercepted,
beat up, and arrested participants before they could reach the venue. They were
jailed overnight and on May 16 thirty-six of them were convicted and sentenced to
three months in prison and fined for holding an “unauthorized demonstration.”
The defendants, mostly members of the Moroccan Human Rights Association
(Association Marocaine des droits de l’Homme,AMDH) and the Forum for Justice
and Truth, remained free on appeal and on November 21 were acquitted.However,
none of the police who beat them without provocation were charged. Many
observers believed that the harsh suppression of the demonstration was prompted
by the AMDH’s public naming of fourteen alleged torturers, including still-serving
senior security officials and a member of parliament, and its demanding that the
justice minister bring charges against them.
On December 10, 2000, police in Rabat and at least six other cities forcibly dispersed
demonstrations staged by Islamists. Some 130 persons were arrested and
eventually charged in connection with the rallies. Some received terms of up to one year in prison, but as of this writing they were all free either because appeals courts
had reduced their sentences or had yet to issue a verdict.
Morocco’s private print media enjoyed considerable freedom, but mostly
avoided criticism of the military, as well as direct criticism of the king, his predecessors,
and the monarchy. For much of the year, newspapers were filled with revelations
about the “dirty war” carried out against dissidents during the 1960s and
1970s. Former inmates of the secret Tazmamart prison described the horrendous
conditions that led to the death of half of its inmates. Victims of torture and relatives
of the “disappeared” also told their stories in the pages of newspapers.While
torturers were accused by name, a taboo remained against implicating King Hassan
II in the repression of those years. In addition, the memoir ofMalika Oufkir, Stolen
Lives: Twenty Years in a Desert Jail, was banned in Morocco. The book, a best-seller
in the United States, described how her entire family was jailed for nearly two
decades in reprisal for a failed coup attempt by her father, Interior Minister
Mohamed Oufkir, in 1972.
Delving into sensitive past dossiers proved costly to the French-language Le
Journal, its Arabic sister publication as-Sahifa, and Demain. In December 2000,
Prime Minister Youssoufi of the Socialist Party banned the three weeklies, exercising
a power granted his office by article 77 of the press code. Le Journal and as-
Sahifa had just printed, and Demain commented on, a previously unpublished
letter dating from 1974, in which a Socialist Party leader of the time implicated
party leaders (including, from the letter’s context,Youssoufi himself) in an unsuccessful
coup attempt against Hassan II. Minister of Culture and Communication
Mohamed Achaari said the newspapers had “launched campaigns using false
reports against the political stability of Morocco and its democratic experience.”
After re-launching Le Journal under a slightly different name (Le Journal Hebdomadaire),
publication director Aboubakr Jamaï and general director Ali Amar
were sentenced on March 1 respectively to three months and two months in prison
and ordered to pay large fines. The verdict came in a defamation suit filed by Foreign
Minister Mohamed Benaïssa, citing articles published in 2000 that charged
him with squandering public monies in real estate transactions while serving as
ambassador to the United States. Amar and Jamaï remained free pending their
appeal,which got under way in November. On November 21,Ali Mrabet, editor of
Demain magazine, received a four-month prison sentence and a fine for “disseminating
false information likely to disturb the public order.” The charge related to
an article about the possible sale of a royal palace. Mrabet remained free as of this
writing.
The Council of Ministers on September 6 approved amendments to the press
code that retained the penalty of imprisonment for defamation.The bill,which still
required approval by parliament as this report went to press, also preserved the
executive branch’s power to seize or suspend publications. On several occasions,
authorities prevented, without explanation, the sale of issues of foreign publications
when they contained sensitive coverage ofMorocco.They seized, for example,
the May 17 issue of the French weekly Courrier International, which carried a feature
on Berbers in Morocco and a caricature of Mohamed VI.
Morocco had more than 2,150 cybercafes and between 300,000 and 400,000 Internet users, according to a September 13 letter from the Moroccan embassy in
Washington to Human Rights Watch. The letter also claimed that the government
did not censor or block any web content.However, the Islamist association al-’Adl
wa’l-Ihsan (Justice and Charity), which is tolerated but not legally authorized,
reported that authorities blocked its websites in April, including that of its organ
Risalat al-Futouwa (www.el-fotowa.com). The embassy declined Human Rights
Watch’s repeated requests for comment. Al-’Adl wa’l-Ihsan also claimed that the
paper edition of Risalat al-Futouwa was seized on occasion and that printers were
pressured by authorities not to print it.
The number of political prisoners,much diminished by a series of releases and
pardons in recent years, was further reduced with the freeing of fifty-six prisoners
on November 7. These included Mohamed Daddach, a Sahraoui who was arrested
in 1979 and was serving a life sentence for having deserted from the Moroccan security
forces.However,King Mohamed VI’s assertion, in an interview published in the
London-based daily ash-Sharq al-Awsat on July 24, that “there is today not a single
political prisoner in Morocco,” was misleading as there remained a small number
of prisoners, including Islamists and supporters of independence for the disputed
Western Sahara, who were being held for nonviolent expression.
One political prisoner, army captain Mustapha Adib,had been convicted in 2000
in a military court of disobeying orders and insulting the army, charges that were
clearly formulated to punish him for denouncing corrupt officers and then speaking
out about the retaliatory harassment he had suffered. He was arrested in
December 1999, one day after his complaints were quoted by the French daily Le
Monde. On February 21, 2001, the Supreme Court confirmed Adib’s sentence of
two and a half years in prison and a discharge from the army. He was due to be
released in June 2002.
In public forums,Moroccans made great strides in exposing the acts of repression
committed during the reign of Hassan II. On the government side, steps were
taken to acknowledge past wrongs and compensate some victims. Those official
steps, though modest, were unparalleled in the Middle East and North Africa.
An arbitration commission, created in 1999 at King Mohamed VI’s request
within the official Human Rights Advisory Board (Conseil Consultatif des droits de
l’Homme, CCDH), determined the amount to be paid to victims of prolonged illegal
detention and to the relatives of “disappeared” persons who had applied for
compensation. The CCDH announced in June that the arbitration commission
had since its creation paid out compensation to 712 persons in 376 cases.
Yet critics pointed out that the process of compensating victims was neither
transparent nor accompanied by any larger truth-seeking project. Some relatives of
persons who “disappeared” said they would accept no money so long as the fate of
their loved ones was not revealed.Other victims said they wanted the abusers either
identified or held accountable before they would seek compensation.
Critics also faulted the process for making “disappearances” and illegal detention
eligible for compensation while arbitrarily ignoring other types of abuse,
including torture and imprisonment on political charges. Another flaw to the
process was that the CCDH had recognized only 112 cases of “disappearance” and
said it had no information about other cases. Local human rights organizations have documented some two hundred unresolved “disappearances” in Morocco
and the Western Sahara and believe the number could be as high as six hundred.
The families of “disappeared” persons whose cases were not recognized by the
CCDH were left without any standing before the compensation commission or
any other government agency. In July, a delegation representing the families of
twelve “disappeared” Sahraouis visited Rabat in order to follow up on the dossiers
they had submitted to officials more than a year earlier. They were sent from ministry
to ministry but, as with their earlier initiative, received not a shred of information.
The year’s most sensational revelations about the past came from Ahmed
Boukhari, the first secret police officer to reveal the inner workings of King Hassan
II’s repression of dissidents in the 1960s and 1970s. In an exposé published June 29-
30 in Le Journal Hebdomadaire and the French daily Le Monde, Boukhari also purported
to answer one of the great mysteries of Moroccan political history: the fate
ofMehdi Ben Barka, the exiled opposition leader who was abducted in Paris in 1965
and never seen again.According to Boukhari,Ben Barka died in France while under
interrogation by Moroccan agents, who arranged secretly to fly his body back to
Morocco. There, police dissolved it in acid.
Instead of opening a judicial inquiry into the credible allegations of murder and
“disappearances” proffered by Boukhari, authorities instead jailed him on charges
of writing bad checks. His imprisonment on August 13 prevented him from complying
with a subpoena to testify in Paris before a French judge investigating Ben
Barka’s disappearance. The timing of Boukhari’s arrest and his pre-trial detention
left little doubt that he was being jailed to punish him for speaking out, and to
intimidate other would-be whistle-blowers. On August 27,Boukhari was convicted
and given a year in prison, a sentence that was reduced on appeal to three months.
The trials of Boukhari and Mustapha Adib illustrated the judiciary’s lack of
independence, despite pledges of reform from Minister of Justice Omar Azzimane.
In July, King Mohamed VI promoted Mohamed Mechbal, the military prosecutor
who had prosecuted Adib in 2000, to the rank of brigadier-general.
Travel restrictions,once commonly imposed on ex-prisoners and human rights
activists, were used sparingly. Some dissidents were allowed to travel abroad for
the first time in years. On January 17,Ahmed Marzouki was given his first passport
since his release from Tazmamart prison in 1991, enabling him to go to Europe to
publicize his new book, Tazmamart, Cell 10. In July, Lahcène Moutiq, a Rabatbased
Sahraoui member of the Forum for Truth and Justice, got his first passport
in years to attend a human rights course in France. However, Sahraoui human
rights activists Brahim Noumri and Mahmoud el-Hamed were turned back at the
Casablanca airport on March 24, as they were about to fly to Geneva to attend
the U.N.Commission on Human Rights.Authorities detained them at the airport
for several hours and confiscated documents containing data and testimonies
about abuses against Sahraouis. The documents had not been returned as of mid-
October.
In March, King Mohamed VI formed yet another commission to examine
reforming Morocco’s personal status code. On November 23, he publicly urged the
new commission to work both on proposals to improve the application of existing  laws and on a longer-term “substantial reform” of the code. Women’s rights
activists,who have long sought to amend the code’s sexually discriminatory provisions
(see Women’s Human Rights), criticized the commission for taking too long
to make recommendations.
Minister of Islamic Affairs Abdelkebir M’daghri Alaoui tacitly condoned verbal
attacks by state-administered mosque preachers against Hakima Chaoui, a poet
and member of the AMDH. The trouble began when the Islamist newspaper at-
Tajdid accused her of insulting the Prophet Muhammad in a poem in favor of
women’s rights that she had written and recited on March 8, International Women’s
Day. She subsequently received phone threats and in August was shouted down at
a public meeting.Minister Alaoui commented on the attacks on Chaoui,“While the
reputation and dignity of individuals are to be protected and respected, protecting
the person of the Prophet does take priority, as does upholding sacred, religious and
national principles.”
Prisoners in Morocco suffered from severe overcrowding, inadequate medical
care, unhygienic conditions, contagious diseases, and mixing of minors and adults.
These conditions were described in the first major report issued by the Moroccan
Prisons Observatory, an independent monitoring organization formed in 1999.
The group conducted several inspection visits during 2000 and said its access to
facilities and prisoners was unrestricted.
As of June, 1,479 Moroccan soldiers remained prisoners of the Polisario Front
in Tindouf, Algeria, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC), which visited them regularly. Of these, 840 had been held by the Polisario
Front for over twenty years, bargaining chips in the long-festering conflict. King
Mohamed VI softened the late Hassan II’s stance of rejecting anything short of a
single repatriation of all Moroccan prisoners of war held by the Polisario, enabling
two batches of some two hundred imprisoned soldiers each to return to Morocco
during 2000.
During 2001, the ICRC urged the immediate repatriation of all prisoners of war.
Morocco was not believed to be holding any, although it held in prison a small
number of Sahraouis civilians convicted of pro-independence activities, and continued
to provide no information on the whereabouts of Sahraoui civilians who
had been forcibly “disappeared” during the years of conflict.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Morocco’s human rights movement generally enjoyed considerable freedom to
meet, collect information, and convey its perspectives in the print press.However,
this freedom was tempered by the brutal arrest and prosecution of activists who
demonstrated on December 9, 2000, the jailing of whistle-blower ex-policeman
Ahmed Boukhari, and the constant pressure facing rights defenders in the Western
Sahara.
In January, the International Federation of Human Rights held its world congress
in Morocco, the first time a major international rights group has done so in
the Arab world.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
European Union
Relations between the European Union (E.U.) and Morocco focused on economic
and social issues following the Association Agreement that came into force
in early 2000. Respect for human rights and democratic principles was an essential
element of the legally binding agreement, but the E.U. did not publicly raise any
human rights concerns at the time of the October 9 E.U.-Morocco Association
Council meeting. European Union policy continued to be guided by a desire to
curb migration, legal and illegal, from Morocco to member countries such as
France, Spain, and Belgium.However, the E.U. provided 1.2 million euros for projects
on freedom of expression, migration, promotion of women’s rights in
Morocco, as well as human rights education and prison reform.
United Nations
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in his April 24 report on the
Western Sahara conflict, urged the “parties to arrange the early repatriation of all
prisoners.” Security Council Resolution 1359 of June 29 asked the parties “to solve
the fate of people unaccounted for” and to “abide by their obligations under international
humanitarian law to release without further delay all those held since the
start of the conflict.”
