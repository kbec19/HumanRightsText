EL SALVADOR
As has become customary in reports from the Reagan Administration, every effort is made in this Report to exculpate the Salvadoran armed forces as an institution for any responsibility for human rights abuses. In keeping with
that tradition, this Report asserts:
Extremists of the right and left are guilty of politically motivated civilian deaths as are some members of the Armed Forces. The climate created by the guerrilla violence has further depreciated the value of human life.
Apparently, after four and a half years during which the armed forces and paramilitary forces allied to them have murdered more than 38,000 civilian noncombatants, the State Department doesn't yet consider that blame should be attributed to more than just "some members of the Armed Forces."
Much of what is wrong with this Report follows from this central failure to acknowledge the institutional responsibility of the Salvadoran armed forces. In addition, we note these objectionable features of the Report on El Salvador:
* In discussing criminal punishment of members of the armed forces for human rights abuses, the Report refers to the sentence imposed in August on a civil defenseman. This is introduced with the words "For example." This is misleading, probably deliberately. This is the only known case in which a civil defenseman has been criminally

punished for a human rights abuse; there is no known case in which a member of the regular armed forces has been criminally punished for such an abuse. Accordingly, it is not an "example."
*	In discussing the reports of private human rights groups, the Report lumps with several other groups the human rights monitoring off ice of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese, Tutela Legal. It then asserts that "[t]hese groups rely primarily on newspaper reporting, supplemented by other sources such as announcements by guerrilla groups and personal testimony." This is misleading, probably deliberately. As
the State Department is well aware, Tutela Legal does not rely at all on newspaper reporting (although it does take testimony from journalists about numbers of bodies they counted and other such matters) and never uses announcements by guerrilla groups. It relies entirely on personal testimony and on such documentation by courts as takes place.
*	The Report says that Tutela Legal1s figures on civilians killed are "mostly of guerrilla supporters (masas)." This is pernicious. Tutela Legal does not attempt to determine how many of those killed are guerrilla supporters and the State Department has no way of knowing how many of them are guerrilla supporters. In any event, whether civilian noncombatants are guerrilla supporters is irrelevant. The circumstances of the killings are the relevant factor
in determining whether they are victims of human rights abuses. In this characterization, the State Department acts as the apologist for the Salvadoran armed forces, which justify their killings on comparable grounds.*

*	The Report says that "[m]ost San Salvador newspapers reflect a conservative point
of view" and that "opinion from the left is limited by the newspapers themselves." It would have been appropriate to mention that there were two. newspapers that provided opinion from the left but that La Cronica was closed in 1980 after its editor and a photographer were abducted and hacked to death and El Independiente was closed in 1981 after army tanks and trucks surrounded its building.
*	The Report says that private human rights groups "genera lly are not harassed by the Government." This is appalling nonsense. During 1983, Dr. Roberto Rivera Martelli, a founding member of the El Salvador Commission on Human Rights who provided medical care to victims of abuses sent to him by the Commission, was abducted by heavily armed men from his clinic and has not been seen since. (The President of the Commission was also killed, though the circumstances do not indicate that this was intended as an attack on the Commission.) The Rivera Martelli disappearance followed a series of attacks on private human rights groups in previous years in which several members of their staffs have disappeared or been killed.
All in all, this is a dreadful report.
