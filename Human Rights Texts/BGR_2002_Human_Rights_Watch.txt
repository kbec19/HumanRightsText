BULGARIA
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
The election of a new government in June offered the promise of reform, but
Bulgaria’s human rights record remained poor in 2001.Roma faced official and private
discrimination and abuse. Police misconduct and inadequate prison conditions
marred the criminal justice system. Respect for free expression worsened as
the outgoing government sought to silence critical broadcasting at the state radio
station. Constraints on religious freedom remained a cause for concern. Some
progress was made in curbing the illegal arms trade and destroying surplus small
arms, but more remained to be done to consolidate gains and halt irresponsible
arms supplies.
The victory of the newly formed National Movement Simeon II (Nacionalno
Dvisenie Simeon Tvori, NDSV) party in the June 17 parliamentary elections took
center stage in 2001. The party, headed by former king Simeon II (who took office
as the new prime minister),won half of all parliamentary seats in an election international
monitors characterized as largely free and fair. The NDSV formed a coalition
government with the predominantly Turkish Movement for Rights and
Freedoms (Dvishenie za Prava i Svobody, DPS).As of October, however, the change
in government had made little impact on the serious human rights challenges facing
the country.
The plight of Bulgaria’s Roma remained a key concern. Roma were beaten by
police in at least five cases, including a June 26 assault at Pleven police station in
which a Rom suspect was allegedly tortured with electricity. Private individuals
beat and shot at Roma on numerous occasions. The abuses sometimes occurred in
the context of trespass or petty theft by Roma. Police and prosecutors generally
failed to conduct serious investigations into the attacks. Four Roma were killed in
the month of June, including two men shot dead by a security guard in Mogila on
June 29.As of October 7, there had been no detentions in connection with the four
deaths.
Bulgaria continued to lack a comprehensive antidiscrimination law. A study
released by the Open Society Institute in September confirmed the broad scale of
discrimination against Roma in the provision of housing, social services and health
care. There were encouraging signs in April, however, when Petar Stoyanov, thenpresident
of Bulgaria, gave his support to the full desegregation of Roma schools,
following the success of a pilot project in Vidin. The Ministry of Education began
consultations with Roma school administrators about desegregation in July.
Roma sometimes faced pressure to leave their homes.Arsonists burned down a
Romany home in Sofia on March 15. In August, villagers from Oriahovica formed
a committee to prevent Roma families from registering as residents of the village.
Oriahovica was the scene of attacks on three Roma homes in December 2000,when
a middle-aged Roma couple was beaten. Many Roma living in Stezherovo village fled in August after five hundred residents drew up a petition calling for the expulsion
of all Roma from the village.
Human rights groups continued to receive credible reports of the excessive use
of force by members of the police and security services.Rules of engagement allowing
the use of deadly force to stop unarmed suspects fleeing provided part of the
explanation. Disturbing incidents included the death of an unarmed twenty-oneyear-
old army conscript, shot repeatedly in the chest by a military police officer on
July 22, the killing of a sixteen-year-old girl in Sofia by an off-duty police officer on
January 31, and the November 2000 death of a sixteen-year-old Iraqi boy, shot by
border guards as he tried to enter Bulgaria.
Conditions in prison and police detention remained alarming. The Bulgarian
Helsinki Committee reported severe overcrowding, inadequate food and sanitation
in prisons as well as excessive periods of pre-trial detention and beatings and other
ill-treatment in police custody. Inmates protested poor conditions in August, taking
over the roof of Sofia’s central prison, and carrying out hunger strikes in Varna.
Women’s human rights continued to be inadequately protected.Bulgaria lacked
anti-sex discrimination legislation. The state response to trafficking in persons fell
below minimum international standards with women victims frequently facing
police hostility.
Freedom of expression came under renewed threat, with the attempted murder
of a journalist in December 2000, problematic criminal defamation laws, and government
interference at the state radio, Bulgarian National Radio (BNR). In February
the government-dominated National Radio and Television Council
appointed Ivan Borislavov as BNR director-general. The decision was widely
regarded as an attempt to silence BNR’s criticism of state authorities, especially by
the popular Horizint (Horizon) program, whose staff were quickly replaced with
workers loyal to the government.Nineteen journalists were dismissed from the station
in the protests that followed. Borislavov resigned prior to an April 9 Supreme
Court ruling invalidating his appointment, but his successor continued to dismiss
staff on questionable grounds and refused to negotiate with protesters. The May
appointment of a new director-general Polya Stancheva, resolved the crisis, and the
journalists were reinstated. An August decision by the incoming government to
restrict journalists’ access at the Council of Ministers raised questions about its
commitment to free expression.
Minority religious groups faced official restrictions and societal hostility. The
much-criticized draft denominations law regulating the status of religious groups
failed to pass in the outgoing Parliament leaving repressive communist-era legislation
in force. In March, the European Court of Human Rights admitted a case
against Bulgaria brought by a Muslim permanent resident over his expulsion from
the country in July 1999 for “illegal religious activity,” following the court’s October
2000 judgment against Bulgaria for expelling Muslims on similar grounds.
Bulgaria announced in January that by December 2000 it had destroyed its
stockpile of antipersonnel landmines in accordance with the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty,
to which it is a state party. Bulgaria also took steps to tighten arms export controls,
such as by banning arms sales to twenty countries, most under U.N. or E.U. arms
embargoes.At the time of this writing, however, it had yet to enact promised legislation institutionalizing other important arms trade reforms, nor to incorporate
human rights criteria into such legislation. The new government also gave indications
it might reverse some arms trade restrictions to boost exports and protect
jobs.Moreover, Bulgaria continued to sell off huge stocks of Soviet-era weapons in
anticipation of joining NATO. In October the Bulgarian defense ministry
announced it intended to sell nearly two hundred surplus tanks and other heavy
weapons to finance purchases of NATO-standard equipment. Past practice, including
confirmed 1999 surplus tank sales to Angola, suggested Bulgaria would likely
export the weapons to human rights abusers, contrary to government pledges
under the 1998 E.U. Code of Conduct on Arms Exports and other agreements.
With U.S. financing and under the auspices of NATO’s Partnership for Peace program,
in August Bulgaria began to destroy large quantities of surplus small arms,
especially assault rifles, but no such funds were made available for the responsible
disposal of surplus heavy weapons.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
There were no reports of government interference in the work of human rights
organizations, but two groups representing Roma and Macedonians reported
harassment and interference with public education efforts related to minority participation
in the March national census.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
On March 27, Freimut Duvé, the OSCE representative on freedom of the media,
voiced concern over the crisis at Bulgarian National Radio, focusing particularly on
the dismissal of journalists. On August 31, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions
and Human Rights issued its final report on the June 17 parliamentary elections,
concluding that the elections met OSCE standards, despite overly-restrictive
media regulations.
Council of Europe
On May 31,Bulgaria ratified two agreements enhancing its citizen’s access to the
European Court of Human Rights. The court declared a religious freedom case
against Bulgaria admissible in March. Bulgaria settled a case before the court in
May, agreeing to expunge the criminal conviction of a conscientious objector who
was willing to perform alternative service. In October the court held that Bulgaria
had violated a ethnic Macedonian organization’s freedom of assembly.
European Union
A September 5 European Parliament resolution emphasized Bulgaria’s progress
toward E.U. accession but noted the outstanding areas of concern enumerated in
the May 28 report from the Parliament’s rapporteur on Bulgaria, particularly the
limited improvement in conditions for Roma. In its November 2001 regular report
on Bulgaria’s progress toward E.U. accession, the European Commission highlighted
police violence and the limited progress in improving the status of Roma.
United States
There was no public reference to Bulgaria’s human rights record when Secretary
of State Colin Powell met then-prime minister Ivan Kostov on April 25. The State
Department country report on human rights practices for 2000 reflected the main
shortcomings in Bulgaria’s record.
