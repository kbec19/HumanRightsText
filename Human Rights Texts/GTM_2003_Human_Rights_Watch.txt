GUATEMALA
Incidents of political violence rose in 2002 as Guatemala struggled to deal
with the legacy of massive human rights violations committed during the
country’s civil war, which ended in 1996. Although political violence was, for the
most part, no longer carried out as a matter of state policy, impunity for acts of violence
remained a chronic problem. Efforts to investigate and punish past abuses
made little progress, and the human rights defenders promoting them faced violence
and intimidation.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Guatemala made little progress in investigating and prosecuting past abuses.
Three years after a U.N.-sponsored Historical Clarification Commission reported
that over two hundred thousand people were killed and tens of thousands of
human rights violations (including “acts of genocide”) occurred during the
country’s armed conflict, only a small number of these cases had been addressed by
the criminal justice system.
Guatemalans seeking accountability for past abuses continued to face daunting
obstacles.The work of the attorney general’s office was severely handicapped by the
meager budget allotted to the office by the Guatemalan Congress,which resulted in
prosecutors carrying excessive caseloads with inadequate resources. The courts
(including the Supreme and Constitutional Courts) routinely failed to resolve judicial
appeals and motions in an expeditious manner and thus allowed defense attorneys
to engage in dilatory legal maneuvering.The army and other state institutions
failed to cooperate fully with investigations into abuses committed by current or
former members. Perhaps the most serious obstacle to progress on human rights
cases was the intimidation of witnesses and justice officials. (See below.) The police
failed to provide adequate protective measures to persons involved in sensitive
cases.
An important exception was the trial of three senior officers charged with planning
the murder of anthropologist Myrna Mack. In October, a three-judge tribunal
convicted Col. Juan Valencia Osorio for his role in the 1990 killing. Valencia, who
was sentenced to thirty years, was the first senior military officer to be jailed for
planning human rights violations committed during Guatemala’s civil war.His codefendants,
Gen. Augusto Godoy Gaitán and Col. Juan Guillermo Oliva Carrera,
were acquitted by the same tribunal.
Unfortunately, the Mack case appeared to be the exception that proved the rule
of impunity in cases involving abuses carried out by current or former members of
the Guatemalan military. The conviction was obtained only after a costly twelveyear
campaign by Helen Mack, the victim’s sister.The case was plagued throughout
by the use of threats and violence to intimidate justice officials, witnesses, and
lawyers. In July, Helen Mack was forced to leave the country after being tipped off
about a plot to assassinate her. In August, Roberto Romero, a lawyer acting for the
Myrna Mack Foundation, reported that he had received death threats and that his
Guatemala City home had been shot at. The prosecution’s case was hampered by
the military’s refusal to supply justice officials with requested documentation and
its obstruction of the investigation by submitting false information and doctored
documents. It was also hampered by the defense’s use of dilatory legal maneuvers
and the failure of judicial magistrates to resolve these in a timely fashion.
Another case in which limited progress was made involved charges pressed by
twenty-one indigenous communities affiliated with the Association for Justice and
Reconciliation (AJR), legally represented by the Center for Human Rights Legal
Action (CALDH), against former presidents Romeo Lucas García and Efraín Ríos
Montt, as well as top military officers in their respective governments. Both cases
alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, including genocide, committed in
the early 1980s. A special prosecutor within the attorney general’s office, who
opened formal investigations into the two cases in 2000 and 2001, respectively, continued
taking testimony from hundreds of eyewitnesses to the massacres.
Meanwhile, other important cases languished. For example, in a case involving
a 1982 massacre of over 160 people in the village of Las Dos Erres, Petén, defense
attorneys continued to prevent a trial from taking place by filing dozens of dilatory
motions. Nearly all of these motions were rejected by the court as being “notoriously
unfounded.”
Lawyers from the Rigoberta Menchú Foundation complained of judicial irregularities
in a civil suit brought by relatives of eleven people killed in a 1995 massacre
in the community of Xaman, in the department of Alta Verapaz. One problem was
the judge’s decision to disallow fifty-four of the sixty questions the foundation’s
lawyers had prepared for the oral examination of the soldiers who allegedly participated
in the massacre.Another was the judge’s decision to summon forty witnesses
from Xaman to present their testimony before the court at the same hour of the
same day. The forty witnesses, mostly women, traveled to Guatemala City from
their remote village, many with children in tow.When their lawyers realized that
these women would be forced to spend hours and possibly days waiting in a
cramped courthouse room to have their turn giving testimony, they sought and
obtained a suspension of the proceeding.
One of the few successful prosecutions of military officers for political violence—
the 2001 conviction of three officers and a civilian for the 1998 killing of
Bishop Juan Gerardi Conedera—was reversed by an appeals court in October. The
appeals court accepted the defense team’s claim that a lower court had failed to conduct
a proper review of evidence presented at the trial. Lawyers from the Archbishop’s
Human Rights Office (ODHA),which was civil party to the prosecution in
the case, had previously raised serious questions about the impartiality of one of the appeals court judges reviewing the case—including the fact that this judge had
allegedly referred to the ODHA lawyers as personal “enemies.”Both the ODHA and
the public prosecutor petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn the appeals court
ruling on the ground that it overstepped the proper scope of judicial review. The
Supreme Court granted a injunction temporarily suspending the appeals court ruling
while it evaluated the merits of these petitions.At this writing, a final ruling by
the Supreme Court was still pending.
Charges of government corruption produced violent reprisals in several
instances. Prosecutor Miguel Angel Bermejo,who was investigating charges of corruption
within the Interior Ministry, reported receiving death threats and being
tipped off that several people were planning to kill him if he continued with the
investigation. In February, a witness in one high-profile corruption case, César
Augusto Rodas Furlán, was shot dead in Guatemala City.
Members of the national police continued to employ excessive force against
civilians.Most of these cases involved abuse of authority by poorly trained and disciplined
police officers.However, there were also cases of apparently deliberate use
of excessive force in police operations. In January, for example, officers from the
Department of Antinarcotics Operations (DOAN) raided the village of Chocón,
opening fire on residents and killing two civilians. At this writing, several officers
were under investigation.
Women and girls working in Guatemala’s two female-dominated industries—
the export-processing (maquiladora) and the live-in domestic worker sectors—
faced widespread sex discrimination at the hands of private employers and the
government. Domestic workers continued to be denied key labor rights protections,
such as the rights to the minimum wage and an eight-hour workday, and had
only limited rights to paid national holidays.Younger women and girls, in particular,
sometimes faced sexual harassment and violence in the homes where they
worked. The Congress failed to act on proposals to reform the labor code to provide
domestic workers equal protection.
Women and girls working in the maquiladora sector, though formally protected
under the law, encountered persistent sex discrimination in employment based on
their reproductive status, with little hope for government remedy. Guatemalan
maquiladoras, many of which were suppliers for well-known South Korean and
U.S.-based corporations, discriminated against women workers in a number of
ways—including requiring women to undergo pregnancy tests as a condition of
employment; denying, limiting, or conditioning maternity benefits to pregnant
women; denying reproductive health care to pregnant workers; and, to a lesser
extent, firing pregnant women. At the time of this writing, the Guatemalan government
had still not adopted policies or practices to investigate and remedy in a
systematic way these gender-specific labor rights violations.
The Congress failed to pass legislation to abolish the death penalty. In July, however,
President Portillo announced a moratorium on the application of the death
penalty during his presidency.
In July, President Portillo announced his support for a program of monetary
compensation for former members of the Civil Self-Defense Patrols (Patrullas de
Autodefensa Civil, PAC),which were an integral part of a counterinsurgency strategy that entailed widespread and egregious human rights violations during the
country’s civil war. The proposal did not include any screening process to exclude
the worst offenders from receiving compensation. The president’s announcement
fueled efforts already underway to renew PAC affiliations and allegiances. Given the
PAC’s historic role in human rights abuses, these efforts threatened to undermine
the progress that had been made toward re-establishing the rule of law in
Guatemala.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Guatemalan human rights defenders were subject to numerous acts of intimidation.
The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights stated that it had
received reports of “more than 100 attacks and acts of intimidation against legal
defenders” (including justice officials, civil society leaders, and civilian witnesses)
in 2002. These attacks included “illicit searches of the offices of human rights
organizations, the theft of equipment and information, death threats made by telephone
and in writing, physical assault, the surveillance of individuals, kidnappings,
and in some cases murder.”
While some of these incidents might have been attributable to common crime,
many others were clearly committed with the aim of intimidating members of the
human rights community. For example, death threats were sent to various nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs), including the Archbishop’s Human Rights
Office, making reference to their work on human rights cases. The offices of some
NGOs were vandalized—and the members of others have been assaulted—by men
who showed no interest in stealing valuable items that common criminals would be
expected to take.
Most seriously, on April 29, a member of the Rigoberta Menchú Foundation,
Guillermo Ovalle de León, was shot to death in a restaurant next to the foundation’s
Guatemala City office. As foundation members pointed out to Human Rights
Watch, given the small size of the restaurant, it seemed an unlikely place to stage an
armed robbery. In July, two men assaulted one of the foundation’s lawyers in front
of the same office.The lawyer told Human Rights Watch that the assailants had held
her in a stranglehold and insulted her,but did not take the laptop computer that she
was carrying at the time.
According to both Guatemalan government and U.N. officials, these acts of
intimidation were most likely being carried out by clandestine groups with possible
links to both public security forces and organized crime.This conclusion is supported
by the fact that the perpetrators revealed themselves, in their threats and in
their actions, to be in possession of the sort of detailed information regarding the
identities and routines of their victims that had traditionally been the domain of
military intelligence.A written threat directed at a team of forensic anthropologists
included the names of people who had not participated in exhumations since the
mid-1990s, suggesting that the perpetrators had either been collecting information
for several years—or at least had access to an institution that had collected it in the
past.
Many observers believed that the attacks were aimed at undermining efforts to
investigate and prosecute past human rights abuses.Whatever the actual motive,
they clearly had this impact, forcing members of the targeted organizations to take
protective measures—including leaving the country—that undermined their work
on human rights cases.
In response to the crisis, the Portillo administration arranged a series of meetings
between a special “Security Cabinet” (consisting of the government’s top ministers
and led by the vice president) and representatives of the NGOs that had been
targets of harassment. These talks did not produce concrete results, however, and
several NGO representatives broke them off, arguing that the government was not
taking serious steps to investigate and take action against the clandestine groups.
The attorney general named a special prosecutor to handle these cases. This
prosecutor, Tatiana Morales, enjoyed the respect and confidence of the human
rights community. However, the resources at her disposal were minimal.Without
more money and more investigators, it appeared unlikely that she would make substantial
progress on the large number of cases assigned to her.
The government ratified several treaties relating to human rights, including the
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement
of children in armed conflicts, and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the
Elimination of Discrimination Against Women.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
The United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA) continued
to play a central role in monitoring compliance with the 1996 peace accords.MINUGUA’s
reports contained detailed human rights analyses and indicated that significant
aspects of the accords were still not implemented.
Guatemala maintained a standing invitation to the United Nations Commission
on Human Rights to send special thematic rapporteurs to investigate human rights
conditions in the country. In June, after a six-day official fact-finding mission,Hina
Jilani, special representative of the secretary-general on human rights defenders,
expressed concern regarding the climate of terror and insecurity in which the
human rights community conducted its work. She noted the lack of commitment
by the Guatemalan government to ensuring their protection and the general worsening
of the human rights situation. Jilani, together with the U.N. special rapporteur
on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions, issued an urgent appeal to
the Guatemalan government to investigate death threats and guarantee human
rights workers the right to life and physical integrity.
In August, the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
against Women offered a critical assessment of the institutions set up by the
Guatemalan government to promote gender equality.
Organization of American States
In July, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) sent a delegation
to Guatemala to assess the situation of human rights defenders. The delegation
met with President Alfonso Portillo and cabinet officials, as well as
representatives of human rights, indigenous rights, and labor organizations. The
delegation issued a statement at the close of its visit outlining its findings, including
that “the Commission has found that no significant progress has been made in
the investigation and punishment of those responsible for human rights violations.”
It added that this failure was “one of the most important reasons for the persistence
of impunity in Guatemalan society.” It urged the government to allocate
greater resources to the attorney general’s office and other institutions charged with
protecting human rights. The commission also described a “pattern of intimidation
against human rights defenders.” Finally, it expressed “deep concern” over the
reorganization of groups of former members of the PAC.
European Union
Political and economic relations between the European Union and Guatemala
were strengthened in June with the adoption of a five-year cooperation agreement.
The primary objective of the cooperation agreement was to improve conditions for
the implementation of the 1996 peace accords by strengthening civil society and
promoting respect for human rights.
United States
The U.S. government provided assistance—through the United States Agency
for International Development (USAID)—to local efforts to investigate and prosecute
past abuses, supporting the work of forensic teams exhuming clandestine
cemeteries and of NGOs involved in human rights prosecutions. During her
recently-ended term in Guatemala, Ambassador Prudence Bushnell intervened
with the government on several occasions to press for increased protection for
human rights defenders.
Since 1990, the U.S. Congress had maintained a ban on International Military
Education and Training (IMET) and Foreign Military Financing (FMF) to
Guatemala. The ban was modified after the peace accords were signed to permit
training in expanded-IMET courses in the specific areas of civilian control over the
military, military justice reform, and respect for human rights. According to
embassy sources, in 2002, non-lethal training was provided to counter-narcotics
units within the national police force,U.S. and Guatemalan military doctors set up
medical clinics on military bases, and U.S. military lawyers participated in a military
justice project aimed at reforming Guatemala’s military code.
The U.S. State Department revoked the visas of former top-ranking military
officers, including former general Francisco Ortega Menaldo, who led the military
intelligence unit, known as the “D-2” (formerly known as the “G-2”), that was
implicated in numerous human rights violations. These visas were revoked under a section of the law that authorized action against people known to have allowed or
conspired in the trafficking of illegal narcotics.
