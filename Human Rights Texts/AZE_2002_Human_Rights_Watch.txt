AZERBAIJAN
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Azerbaijan became a member of the Council of Europe after staging parliamentary
elections that the international community and local observers branded as
“fraudulent.”Having secured its firm grip on the political process and its entreé to
European institutions, the government harassed the independent media and political
parties and cracked down against protesters with social and economic
demands. It resisted pressure to release more than a few dozen political prisoners.
The Council of Europe had conditioned Azerbaijan’s admission on, among
other things,“free and impartial elections,” and delayed its final decision on admission
until after the vote. The Azerbaijani authorities failed this requirement spectacularly.
The November vote gave the ruling party, Yeni Azerbaycan (New
Azerbaijan) a majority in Parliament, again delivering President Heidar Aliev a
compliant legislature. Opposition parties such as Musavat, the National Independence
Party, and the Democratic Party of Azerbaijan, which enjoy significant support,
were virtually excluded.
Repeat elections in eleven of the one hundred districts, urged by the Council of
Europe, did not affect the overall result. After a campaign period marred by government
interference and intimidation, election officials manipulated turnout figures,
falsified vote tallies, and stuffed ballot boxes. The level of fraud prompted the
Council of Europe observer mission to comment,“[T]he scale of the infringements
doesn’t fit into any framework.We’ve never seen anything like it.”
Exploitation of oil and gas resources allegedly secured benefits for a small ruling
elite. Transparency International rated Azerbaijan one of the world’s five most corrupt
countries. The president of the state oil company, SOCAR, twice sued opposition
leader Etibar Mamedov for claiming that officials exported one and a half
million tons of oil surreptitiously, making it allegedly the country’s biggest source
of corruption. The broader economy was denuded of government attention and
investment. President Aliev’s August decree, ordering SOCAR to pay $190,000 per
month to assist some of the 800,000 Azeris still displaced by the Nagorno Karabakh
conflict, appeared to offer implicit acknowledgement of a link between a small
elite’s control over oil and gas wealth and poverty in society at large.
Opposition parties’ protests against the presidential elections combined with
local anger about unemployment and electricity and gas shortages. In November
2000 police clashed with demonstrators in Sheki, and reportedly beat and detained
hundreds. In July, a court tried twenty-seven of the protesters, mostly from opposition
parties, sentencing most to prison terms of four to six years on charges of
instigating public disorder, using violence against police officers, and destruction of property. In January handicapped Karabakh war veterans embarked on a mass
hunger strike in Baku to demand pension increases. The government promised to
examine their demands, but instead dissolved the Society of Karabakh Invalids,
replacing it with a government-controlled entity. On February 19, police stormed
the society’s Baku headquarters and violently broke up a renewed hunger strike,
reportedly beating men on crutches and in wheelchairs. Local authorities began
withdrawing concessions that had allowed the handicapped veterans to run shops
and minibus services to make a living, and seized all of the society’s branch offices
and property for the new entity. In July, fifteen were found guilty on charges of participating
in public disorders and, absurdly, beating twenty-five policemen, and
were given sentences ranging up to six years’ imprisonment.
Throughout the year the government harassed opposition parties, intimidated
independent media, and deterred social protests, but offered just enough human
rights concessions to placate the Council of Europe. In August, after the council had
presented the government with a confidential experts’ report on alleged political
prisoners in Azerbaijan, President Aliev amnestied or reduced the sentences of
ninety-five prisoners, including seven of the Karabakh handicapped veterans. The
Council of Europe secretary general urged President Aliev to release or grant a new
trial to all political prisoners, whom Azerbajiani nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs) numbered in the hundreds. The October 17 release of only three recently
imprisoned newspapermen drew Council of Europe criticism, which President
Aliev’s office dismissed as “subjective.”
In the second half of 2001 the authorities sharply increased their pressure on the
independent media. Tax officials investigated Baku’s ABA Television and confiscated
equipment, which forced the station’s management to shut it down. The
authorities withheld licenses from provincial independent broadcasters, closing or
fining them at will. In September police in Balakan detained the head of a local television
station and shut it down by threatening to imprison him and demolish his
home if he attempted to broadcast again.
Local authorities also undermined the production and distribution of independent
newspapers. The mayor of Baku ordered the removal of newspaper kiosks
belonging to private distribution companies. In September a court ordered the closure
of the Baku Printing Press and imprisoned its director on tax charges.He had
reduced rates for independent newspapers, challenging the monopolistic high
prices for printing and newsprint set by government-controlled enterprises.
State officials used slander laws and obliging courts to close newspapers or issue
them crippling fines for publishing articles that alleged government corruption or
other misdeeds. In September, after it published a polemical article about state
racketeering in which it briefly mentioned the mayor of Baku, a court closed Bakinskii
Bulvar, gave the editor a suspended prison sentence,imprisoned the owner, and
seized his apartment and that of the article’s author, who sought asylum abroad.
The editor of Milletin Sesi (The People’s Voice) newspaper was imprisoned after it
published an article suggesting a presidential administration official consorted
with prostitutes. Both were released on October 17.
Police detained journalists, beat them, and confiscated their equipment as they
attempted to cover demonstrations. In several cases unknown assailants beat journalists.
The authorities disrupted opposition parties’ activities by making it difficult for
them to lease office premises, refusing registration, arresting party officials, and
violently breaking up their meetings and demonstrations. In August, police in
northern Azerbaijan blocked Musavat deputy Rauf Arifoglu’s tour of party
branches, and beat and detained local Adalyat party officials on the eve of their
leader’s visit. Police violently dispersed Democratic Party demonstrations in Baku
in April, and in Nakhchivan in September, beating and detaining party members.
An alleged culture of corruption, bullying, and neglect in the army continued to
cause deaths unrelated to combat. A former Defense Ministry aide reported that
since the 1994 Nagorno Karabakh ceasefire, bullying, accidents, infectious disease,
and malnutrition had killed or crippled more than 5,000 soldiers. Eighteen soldiers
died in a three-week period in August alone,of suicide, sunstroke, and dehydration.
The head of a soldiers’ mothers’ organization linked the deaths of many soldiers
with organized extortion. Some of the dead had earlier asked their families for
money to hand over to their officers.
Chiefly young men from poor backgrounds were drafted, and it was widely
reported that allegedly, a U.S. $2,000 bribe could assure an exemption from military
service on spurious ill-health grounds. Poor and cramped conditions in army
barracks exacerbated and spread diseases such as tuberculosis, diphtheria, and
typhoid. In November former navy captain Janmirza Mirzoev,who had accused the
defense minister of corruption, was sentenced to eight years in prison for his
alleged role in a 1993 murder. The only witness said to have offered any evidence
against Mirzoev withdrew his testimony in court. The murder charges came after
Mirzoev had already endured two years of reported harassment and repeated
detentions.
A new criminal code adopted in September 2000 criminalized torture as a specific
offence and stipulated a five to ten year prison sentence for officials found to
have used torture to extract confessions. However, police continued to torture or
ill-treat detainees with relative impunity. The judge who tried the Sheki demonstrators
ignored the defendants’ assertions that they were tortured or ill-treated in
custody.At this writing no police officers had been indicted for the death in custody
of SOCAR engineer Ilgar Javadov in Baku in May. Reportedly, a forensic examination
established beating as the cause of death, though the police claimed he died
jumping from a window.
In a rare exception to the general rule of impunity, and after President Aliev’s
intervention in the case, a former Baku police station chief was brought to trial in
September for his alleged role in torturing to death a factory trade union leader in
1994.
To a limited extent, conditions and incidence of tuberculosis in the prison system
ameliorated. In May, Parliament adopted an extradition law that expressly forbade
extraditing people to countries where they face torture, in line with
Azerbaijan’s obligations under the Convention against Torture. But Azerbaijan
continued to extradite suspected Chechen fighters to Russia, and in October extradited
two terrorism suspects to Egypt,both countries which systematically tortured
criminal suspects.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
In a positive move, the Ministry of Justice and four human rights NGOs signed
an agreement in September to work together on prison reform.
In October 2001 the Ministry of Internal Affairs arbitrarily expelled Mehti
Mekhtiyev, the director of the Human Rights Resource Center, an NGO, back to
Baku from Nakhchivan, where he was visiting twenty-two beaten and detained
members of the Democratic Party.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
A November 2000 report by the U.N. special rapporteur on torture concluded
that torture in Azerbaijan was widespread and that detainees assumed that they
would be tortured. The report concluded that this fostered detainees’ acquiescence
in investigators’ demands and arguably constituted mental torture.
In October 2001 the U.N.Human Rights Committee reviewed Azerbaijan’s second
periodic report. It requested the government to report back within one year on
the measures taken to address the committee’s principal concerns: inaction on violence
against women and trafficking, harassment and prosecutions of journalists
and actions forcing closure of media outlets, and serious executive interference in
the electoral process.
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) fielded an
observer mission to the November 2000 parliamentary election. The head of the
OSCE’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights described the conduct
of the vote as “a crash course in various types of manipulation” in a press conference,
yet criticism was muted in the organization’s official report. On October 4,
2001 the OSCE representative on freedom of the media expressed alarm at the
growing assault on freedom of media in Azerbaijan.The OSCE Minsk Group intensified
its efforts to mediate a negotiated solution to the Karabakh conflict.
Council of Europe
The Council of Europe squandered its leverage over Azerbaijan at the beginning
of the year by admitting it to membership despite the fraudulent election. By midyear
both the secretary general and the Council ofMinisters had dispatched human
rights fact-finding groups to Azerbaijan.Beginning in September the secretary general
expressed concern over the crackdown on independent media and stepped up
pressure regarding the unresolved situation of political prisoners.
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank secured pledges of fiscal
transparency, particularly in the handling of oil revenues, and prompted the government
to design a strategy to reduce poverty and encourage broad-based growth
to enable further lending to take place.
