 THE NETHERLADS
 The Netherlands is a parliamentary democracy under a consti-
 tutional monarchy. Its political system is designed to allow
 the maximum expression of diversity of opinion consistent with
 public order. Its socio-economic system is structured to pro-
 vide a relatively high level of health and educational benefits
 and to redistribute national income significantly.
 The Dutch observance of internationally recognized hum rights
 is based on deep-seated and widely-shared concepts of human
 dignity and respect for law. The Netherlands has a long con-
 sistent tradition of respect for human rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture :is guaranteed by law (Penal Code of 1884,
 paragraph 300, as amended) asd respected in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punish-
 ment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice. Prison
 conditions are adequate and no differentiation in treatment
 of prisoners is made by type of conviction, social class,
 race, sex or religion. There are no sunmary executions.
 c. Disappearances
 Abductions, secret arrests and clandestine detention by police
 or other official security forces do not occur in the
 Netherlands.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment is guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice. No persons presently are
 detained in  disregard of established principles. The equiva-
 lent of the right of habeas corpus exists in practice.
 Except in time of national emergency, preventive detention is
 not permitted; normally a suspect can be held without charge
 no more than six hours.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to fair public trial is guaranteed by law and res-
 pected in practice. Defendants have the right to effective
 counsel. Formal charges must be filed within six hours of
 arrest and charges must be formally, and clearly stated. The
 judiciary is independent of the executive and the military.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. A formal search warrant issued by a
 magistrate is required to enter a private residence. The
 government enegates in no violations of the home.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 The Netherlands enjoys a high per capita income--$10,175--and
 is an affluent country. The government pursues policies to
 ensure that these benefits are distributed equitable throughout
 the economy. There is a relative absence of class distinction. A con
 
 
 842
 educational system serves all economic levels. The
 economy remains strongly capitalist, although with
 substantial intervention by the government for the purpose
 of redistributing income. Extensive welfare programs
 assure adequate health care and shelter for those with low
 incomes. Education is required up to age 16 and is free
 to age 18. The literacy rate in the Netherlands is
 estimated to be about 97 per cent.
 There is substantial but declining discrimination against
 women in hiring, wages, work assignments and promotion, as
 well as in many other sectors of society. The government
 pursues equal rights including special considerations for
 women, for minority groups and for the economically
 disadvantaged through legislation and effective government
 procedures to ensure compliance. Tens of thousands of
 people from former Dutch colonies and other former
 colonial areas have emigrated to the Netherlands where
 many have acquired Dutch nationality and thereby have
 become permanent members of Dutch society.
 These ethnic minorities, along with emigrant workers from
 non-western European countries who have become temporary
 residents, face discrimination in housing, employment,
 education, public accomodations and social acceptance.
 Although these problems stem from individual attitudes and
 not from official government policy, they appear to be on
 the increase. Discrimination because of race, color or
 religion is prohibited by Article 429 of the Dutch penal
 code. The'government is preparing a constitutional change
 reinforcing this prohibition.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These freedoms are in effect. There is no system of
 censorship. The press is privately owned and fiercely
 independent. The two television channels are
 government-owned and operated on the basis of time
 allocated to private broadcasting societies. The
 political opposition is alive, well and active; criticism
 of the government is frequently aired. No journalists
 have been intimidated and none has been imprisoned without
 due process. Freedom of religion is a centuries-old,
 well-established, honored and living tradition in the
 Netherlands.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There is freedom of domestic and foreign travel,
 emigration and repatriation. Despite the fact that the
 Netherlands is one of the world's five most densely
 populated countries, the government has attempted to
 provide places for the continuing tide of refugees from
 Vietnam and other places in response to requests from the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. A
 well-organized system of welcome, orientation and
 assistance has been set up to facilitate the integration
 of refugees into Dutch society. The Dutch traditionally
 have regarded themselves as a haven for refugees,
 political dissidents and displaced persons. During the
 past year the Netherlands received nearly 2,000 refugees
 and dissidents, mostly from Vietnam but also from Africa,
 Latin American, Eastern Europe, Southwest Asia and
 Southeast Asia.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political life is carried out in a highly democratic
 fashion. Legislative power is vested in an assembly
 elected by universal suffrage. Women enjoy the same legal
 
 
 843
 protection as men; their participation in the political
 life of the country is growing at an increasing rate.
 Some political parties have quotas for women candidates
 for public office in order to increase women's
 representation. There is an active trade union movement,
 with nearly a century of tradition, which has the legal
 but seldom exercised right to strike. The unions have a
 well-established and exercised right to organize and
 bargain. They also lobby effectively in the parliament.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The issue of outside investigation has not arisen with
 regard to the Netherlands. In addition to national
 offices of Amnesty International and the International
 Commission of Jurists, there are in the Netherlands
 approximately a dozen permanent organizations and numerous
 ad hoc organizations concerned with civil and human
 rights, many of which receive government assistance in one
 form or another. The Netherlands government is most
 active in the United Nations Human Rights Commission and
 in other organs of the United Nations.
