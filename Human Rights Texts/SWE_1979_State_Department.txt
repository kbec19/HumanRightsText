 SWEDEN
 
 Fundamental political freedoms and human rights of
 Swedish citizens are guaranteed by the Constitution.
 Sweden occupies a prominent position in international
 efforts to enhance human rights. In the United
 Nations, it has been active in support of initia-
 tives against torture, campaigned for measures to
 ensure religious tolerance and proposed the outlaw-
 ing of capital punishment. Sweden has ratified the
 two International Covenants and the Optional Proto-
 col to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
 and is a party to the European Convention on Human
 Rights. In the North/South dialogue, Sweden has
 been in the forefront of industrialized countries
 in arguing for major resource transfer by means of
 grant aid to the least developed nations. Its aid
 program, at one percent of the Gross National Pro-
 duct, is proportionately far larger than that of
 the United States.
 The comprehensive system of human rights which
 exists in Sweden exists by government design. The
 Government and a cross section of Swedes from right
 to left consider the protection of human rights a
 cornerstone of Swedish society. Swedish ombudsmen,
 appointed by Parliament and with full autonomy, are
 charged with the investigation of complaints of
 private persons that their rights have been violated.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, In-
 cluding Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and re-
 spected in practice.-
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment
 or punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Sweden prides itself on a prison system
 which is among the most progressive in the world.
 Periodic home visits for prisoners are a unique
 feature of the system.

 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Guarantees with respect to the integrity of the
 person are scrupulously heeded.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Swedish Constitution forbids deprivation of
 liberty without public trial by a court of law.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by
 law and respected in practice.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education
 Sweden has been a world leader since the 1930s in
 policies to meet basic needs such as food, shelter,
 health care and education. Social welfare policy
 includes provision of health and medical services,
 welfare services, various family benefits, pensions,
 and disability and unemployment insurance. Per
 capita gross national product in Sweden is above
 that in the United States and wealth is more evenly
 distributed among all segments of the population.
 Sweden has a large number of foreign workers who enjoy
 welfare benefits and legal protection equal to those
 enjoyed by Swedish citizens, including even the
 right to vote in local elections. The Swedish
 Government has established special programs designed
 to help the immigrant workers adjust to Swedish
 life and culture, and has cooperated with the press
 to generate publicity aimed at gaining greater
 acceptance of immigrant workers among the Swedish
 public at large.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, In-
 cluding:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Swedes enjoy the full exercise of these freedoms.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of movement within and from the
 country.
 
 
 665
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 The country has a long history of orderly democratic
 political life in which all citizens and certain
 foreign residents fully participate. Labor is free
 to organize and to act, and workers have the right
 to strike. The large majority of the Swedish work-
 ing population belongs to a trade union. This in-
 cludes career military personnel and civilian
 government officials. Although the country's
 largest trade union association and largest poli-
 tical party are closely associated, the activities
 of that union and of others are directed by the
 unions themselves.
 Women enjoy legal equality in Sweden. They parti-
 cipate more fully in the economic, political and
 social life of Sweden than do women in most other
 countries in the world. A conscious effort continues
 to extend actual equality between the sexes to the
 fullest.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 No question of an independent, outside investigation
 of alleged human rights violations in Sweden has
 been posed. With regard to pertinent third coun-
 tries, Sweden supports the principle of independent
 outside investigations.
