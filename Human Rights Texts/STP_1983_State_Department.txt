 SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE*
 Sao Tome and Principe has been a one-party state since gaining
 independence from Portugal in 1975. Effective political
 power is concentrated in the Presidency. The country is
 composed of two small islands off the West Coast of Africa
 with a population of about 100,000. At independence,
 the Movement for the Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe
 acceded to control of the Government, and Manuel Pinto da
 Costa, leader of the political party, was chosen President
 without opposition, by the Popular Assembly, constitutionally
 The supreme organ of state and highest legislative body.
 The party reconfirmed him for a second five-year term in
 1980. President da Costa is the country's major decision-maker,
 although certain Cabinet members exercise an undetermined degree
 of influence on government policy.
 All political opposition, whether through political parties or
 otherwise, is prohibited. The Government draws heavily
 on Marxist-Leninist principles. State control of the means
 of production (mainly cacao plantations) is the general
 rule. In practice, freedoms of speech, press, and assembly
 are circumscribed, and no expressions of public opposition
 to the Government are permitted. All news media are under
 government control. A small opposition group in exile in
 Portugal has thus far shown no evidence of being able to
 influence events on the islands. There is no known organized
 political opposition in Sao Tome itself. The small Lao Tomean
 Army is reinforced by troops from Angola, and there are civilian
 and military advisers from the Soviet Union, Cuba, East Germany,
 Poland, Bulgaria, North Korea, and Vietnam.
 The economy of Sao Tome has encountered very serious problems
 in recent years due to the steady decline in cacao exports.
 This reflects both lower world prices for cacao and serious
 management problems on the nationalized plantations. The
 situation became particularly acute in 1983 when poor rains
 further reduced both cacao and food crops, resulting in serious
 food shortages.
 In July 1983, the da Costa government released nine prisoners
 who had been jailed in 1977 on charges of planning a coup. With
 the exception of this event and the deterioration in the food
 situation, there has been no known change in the overall human
 rights situation in 1983.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS:
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There were no known executions in Sao Tome in 1983, either
 of common criminals or political prisoners.
 '     There is no resident American Embassy in Sao Tome. The
 American Ambassador in Gabon is accredited to Sao Tome. The
 Ambassador and Embassy staff in Libreville visit the islands
 periodically. Information on the human rights situation is
 therefore limited.

 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of abductions or secret political arrests
 in 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 No reports of these abuses were received in 1983.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There have been reports that no more than 10 Sao Tomeans were
 arrested and detained without trial for a period of months
 because of public criticism of the Government. These include
 individuals detained for expressing open dissatisfaction with
 the Government's handling of the food situation; the numbers
 are not known but are believed to be small. In general, the
 number of such arrests in 1983 is believed to have declined,
 and there have been no reports of groups of people being
 detained, as reportedly occurred in late 1982 on the Island
 of Principe.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 An estimated 100 people may be imprisoned without trial; in
 past years, the only political prisoners who were given trials
 were those accused of coup-plotting in 1977. In those trials,
 and in criminal trials since that time, the accused are
 assigned counsel by the Government. There is no tradition
 of independent defense counselors; common criminals are given
 a hearing and sentenced by a judge. The Constitution does not
 address the right of public trial, although there have been
 instances of public trials of individuals accused of common
 crimes in recent years. Criminal trials are occasionally
 reported by the local media.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The security services are alert and quickly react to public
 expressions of opposition or dissatisfaction with the Govern-
 ment. Because of Sao Tome's geographic isolation and low
 population, the Government does not have a highly intrusive
 security system to detect opposition opinion. Government
 interference in private life is minimal. The Government's
 loosely organized system of informers and monitoring of
 individual participation in the activities of the country's
 sole legal political party are used to insure that potential
 dissidents are identified.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The legal Sao Tomean media are organs of the Government,
 consisting of one radio station which carries music, government-
 prepared news releases, and instructional programs, and a weekly
 two- to four-page newspaper of government-prepared news releases.
 There are no foreign wire service items other than occasional
 items from Soviet and Angolan sources. No public written or
 oral criticism of the Government is tolerated.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political assembly and activity are legal only within the
 country's sole political party, the Movement for the Libera-
 tion of Sao Tome and Principe. The party exists to encourage
 popular support for the Government. All labor organizations
 are affiliated with the party and are prohibited from striking.
 Virtually all economic activity takes place within the con-
 straints of the government-run economy. Cultural and social
 organizations are reported to require government approval,
 which is believed to be easily obtained.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 This right is protected in the national constitution and
 three religious communities do practice freely: Roman Catholic,
 Evangelical Protestant, and Seventh-day Adventist. The state
 provides some funding for a school and social services center
 managed by the Catholic church.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 The geographic isolation and poverty of the country severely
 limit foreign travel and emigration. The Government closely
 controls exit visas for the few people who do travel. Almost
 all trips are for government missions or medical evacuations,
 and there were several reports during 1983 that approvals to
 seek medical care abroad were more restricted than in the
 past, probably due to a shortage of foreign exchange. Do-
 mestic travel is not controlled by the Government, but the
 lack of reliable and affordable air service between the
 islands limits travel.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Government policy is formed by President da Costa, with
 his key Cabinet and security officials. There were no
 elections or referendums in Sao Tome in 1983. There was one
 "Assemblea," a series of mass meetings lasting several days,
 to encourage popular support for the Government. Women
 have constitutional guarantees of equality, and several
 are active in public life. One senior official, the
 Minister of Foreign Affairs, is a woman. Cultural factors,
 rather than legal or political restraints, limit the actual
 participation of women in the Government. The Sao Tome
 population is relatively homogeneous, and there have been no
 reports of a policy of discrimination on a tribal or regional
 basis among Sao Tomean citizens. As energetic outsiders,
 Cape Verdeans in Sao Tome do suffer some informal discrimi-
 nation. Members of the islands' small educated class appear
 to enjoy advantages in government employment possibilities.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of.
 Human Rights
 In recent years, Amnesty International reports have expressed
 concern about certain individual Sao Tomeans detained for
 alleged political activity. Several individuals cited by
 Amnesty International have been released, including Albertino
 Neto, the former chief of the armed forces, who was imprisoned
 from 1977 until July 1983, when he was one of nine detainees
 
 
 291
 who were given amnesty. The extent to which the Government
 is cognizant of or influenced by international human rights
 organizations is not known. In 1983, Amnesty International
 was concerned by the continuing imprisonment of five people
 convicted in 1977 and 1979 whose trials did not meet interna-
 tionally recognized, standards and by the use of detention
 without trial. Freedom House rates Sao Tome "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, and CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Sao Tomean economy has been based on plantation agri-
 culture, particularly cacao, since the 1800's. At independ-
 ence, the Portuguese-owned plantations, which occupied 90
 percent of the arable land, were taken over by the Government
 and since then have been operated as state-owned enterprises.
 The country has encountered major economic problems in
 recent years caused by the steady decline in both the value
 and volume of cacao exports, which represent 90 percent of
 total exports. This trend has resulted from a combination
 of declining world cacao prices and mismanagement of the
 state-owned plantations. Cacao production, which had
 reached 10,000 tons in 1975, is believed to have dropped to
 near 2,000 tons in 1983.
 The country is dependent on imported foodstuffs, and the lack
 of foreign exchange in recent years has caused shortages of
 many staple foods and other consumer products. The situation
 became particularly acute in 1983 when poor rains intensified
 the long-term problems. Severe shortages of both imported
 staple foods and tree fruits have been reported. Malnutrition
 is reportedly emerging as a problem for the first time.
 The country's per capita gross domestic product, which has
 been estimated as high as $450 in the late 19701s, is now
 believed to have fallen to about $300 as a result of the
 steady deterioration of the economy. In spite of its
 economic problems, the Government has made a major effort to
 improve social and educational services. The Minister of
 Education stated in March 1983 that 35,000 students were in
 school, roughly one-third of the population. Literacy is
 estimated at about 50 percent. Infant mortality statistics
 in recent years have varied between 50 and 65 per 1,000
 births. The Government states that it provides free basic
 medical care and medicine to all citizens but reliable
 statistics to support the Government's contention are not
 available. There have been no indications of discrimination
 by sex or religion in the allocation of economic or social
 benefits under government programs on Sao Tome and Principe.
 As previously noted there have been reports that Cape
 Verdean citizens on the island sometimes encounter greater
 difficulty in obtaining benefits than native Sao Tomeans.
