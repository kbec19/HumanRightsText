COLOMBIA
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Colombia’s internal war intensified in 2002 following the February 20 collapse
of three years of formal talks between the government and Colombia’s largest guerrilla
group. Paramilitary groups operating with the tolerance and often support of
units within Colombia’s military were linked to massacres (defined in Colombia as
the killing of three or more people at the same place and time), selective killings,
and death threats. There were numerous and credible reports of joint militaryparamilitary
operations and the sharing of intelligence and propaganda, including army-generated appeals to guerrillas to turn themselves in.Throughout Colombia,
paramilitaries continued to move uniformed and heavily armed troops unhindered
past military installations.
Compared to past years, the government reported more clashes between its
troops and paramilitaries, and more arrests of suspected paramilitaries. Yet paramilitaries
appeared more numerous and militarily stronger than ever. They
claimed to have over ten thousand armed and trained members, a number that was
not disputed by government or other sources.
In July, paramilitary leader Carlos Castaño announced the dissolution of the
United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia,
AUC), the paramilitary alliance he headed. But by September, the AUC had
reunited, though it continued to be prey to internal conflicts over profits reaped
from drug trafficking. Mayors, municipal officials, governors, human rights
groups, the public advocate’s office, and even some police detachments regularly
informed the appropriate authorities about credible threats by paramilitaries. Yet
only rarely did military forces take effective action to stop paramilitary advances.
A tragic example was the case of Boyajá, Chocó, one of the worst slaughters of
the entire Colombian conflict. In April, the Catholic Church and public advocate
sent warnings to military and police commanders about large groups of paramilitaries
traveling along the Atrato River past military installations maintained by the
army’s Seventeenth Brigade and the navy’s River Battalion No. 50, a unit that has
received U.S. training and weapons.The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
(Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia-Ejército del Pueblo, FARC-EP),
which also maintained a presence in the region, clashed with paramilitary forces at
Boyajá on May 1. During the fighting, guerrillas launched at least one gas cylinder
bomb that hit a church where displaced persons were gathered, killing 119, including
at least forty-eight children.
The Bogotá office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights
(UNHCHR) concluded that guerrillas were directly responsible for the displaced
persons’ deaths. U.N. investigators also criticized the military’s failure to heed
reports of paramilitary forces in the area and mount an operation to catch them.
Investigators received credible information suggesting that, after the clash, soldiers
met with a paramilitary commander whose forces remained in the area despite the
military’s presence. On July 9, the inspector general’s office (Procuraduría) opened
an investigation of the commanders of the security force units in the region,among
them Maj. Gen. Leonel Gómez Estrada, commander of the Colombian army’s First
Division, and Fourth Brigade commander Brig. Gen.Mario Montoya. In a disturbing
development apparently aimed at stifling human rights reporting, three of the
generals targeted in the investigation filed slander charges in May against Father
Jesús Albeiro Parra Solis, a priest who had helped raise the alarm about the paramilitary
presence.
Even when the authorities were under orders to arrest paramilitary leaders, they
rarely did so.As of this writing, for example, the attorney general’s office had at least
twenty-six outstanding arrest warrants against Castaño. In addition, Colombian
courts had returned guilty verdicts against him in absentia in three cases, including
the murder of presidential candidate Bernardo Jaramillo in 1990.
Massacres, traditionally used by paramilitaries to spread terror, were less
numerous than in 2001, but the decrease appears to have reflected a change in
paramilitary tactics rather than a decrease in overall violence. Witnesses, church
officials, and municipal observers, among others, described to Human Rights
Watch how paramilitaries seized large groups of people, then killed individuals separately,
to avoid the publicity that results when incidents are recorded as massacres.
As the Bogotá office of the UNHCHR noted in March,“Although these [tactics] had
less drastic effects than the massacres, [paramilitaries] committed numerous individual
executions. The Office was informed of cases in which the paramilitaries,
after choosing their victims from a large group of people they had abducted, killed
them individually or in small groups, leaving the bodies scattered in different locations.”
Elected in May with 53 percent of the vote, an unprecedented majority, President
Álvaro Uribe Vélez immediately imposed several emergency measures to
address political violence. Some weakened the ability of state institutions to monitor
and investigate human rights violations, and gave the security forces power to
arrest and tap telephones without warrants in certain circumstances. Another
measure allowed the executive branch to place large areas under military control
and restrict the movement of civilians and the entry of foreigners, including journalists
working for international media. In September, the Uribe administration
announced that twenty-seven municipalities containing over one million people in
the departments of Bolívar, Sucre, and Arauca had been designated “rehabilitation
and consolidation” zones where rights were curtailed.
Fernando Londoño, who headed the newly combined interior and justice ministries,
told the Colombian Congress that he intended to make emergency measures
“permanent,”raising fears that Colombia would return to a pattern of decades past,
when presidents maintained the country under a virtually unbroken state of siege
and rights were routinely violated by state agents.
President Uribe began recruiting a planned one million civilian informants to
provide information in exchange for cash. By mid-September, the army reported
having paid over U.S.$340,000 for information that led to the capture of members
of illegal armed groups. In addition,President Uribe authorized the army to recruit
a force of fifteen thousand peasants to fight in their home regions with regular
troops. Both strategies raised serious questions about the government’s ability to
ensure that informants and new recruits were not drawn from paramilitary groups,
whose forces were already working with some military troops but were seeking to
“legalize” the relationship. It also threatened to repeat the tragic history of the
1980s,when similar laws combined with a lack of oversight led to egregious human
rights violations.
The criminal prosecution of the perpetrators of human rights crimes deteriorated
markedly as Attorney General Luis Camilo Osorio, who took office in mid-
2001,undermined or derailed key cases.His hostility to human rights investigations
was evidenced, most notably, by his purge of prosecutors and investigators willing
to pursue such cases.
In April 2002, seven prosecutors with the attorney general’s Human Rights Unit
and one member of the Technical Investigation Unit (Cuerpo Técnico de Investigaciones, CTI) received credible and serious threats related to their work investigating
high-profile cases of human rights violations. Attorney General Osorio
failed to take any measures to protect the officials. Subsequently, they requested
protective measures from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights
(IACHR). Dozens of other prosecutors and investigators resigned or fled Colombia.
After the Spanish government extradited former Colombian ambassador to the
European Union Carlos Arturo Marulanda to Colombia to face charges of supporting
illegal paramilitary groups, the attorney general’s office dropped the most
serious charges against him and ordered his release on November 1. In its annual
report, the UNHCHR office said that Osorio’s record raised “serious concerns
about the prospects for strengthening the institution and its commitment to combating
impunity [and] …the independence and autonomy of prosecutors in their
investigations into human rights violations, particularly those involving paramilitary
groups and public officials.”
According to Colombia’s national planning department, illegal armed groups
increased in number again in 2002. In addition to paramilitaries, there were over
twenty-one thousand guerrillas, most of whom belonged to the FARC-EP. The
FARC-EP, the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional, ELN),
and the AUC all actively incorporated children into their ranks, severely punishing
or even killing them if they attempted to leave.
The FARC-EP escalated attacks on civilians, among them hundreds of mayors
and other local officials. “Our orders are to prevent all representatives of the state
from functioning in every part of Colombia,” guerrillas announced in June. On
June 5, FARC-EP gunmen killed the mayor of Solita in the southern department of
Caquetá.When President Uribe was sworn in on August 7, guerrillas launched an
attack with mortars and explosives in Colombia’s capital, Bogotá, killing at least
nineteen bystanders.
In several regions, paramilitaries were in control of towns while guerrillas controlled
the countryside, making travel across these areas highly risky.At roadblocks,
armed fighters demanded to see identification cards from all travelers, and the possession
of identification from an area deemed to be under the influence of the
enemy could be a death sentence.
Armed groups extrajudicially executed perceived opponents and, on some occasions,
those who simply broke their rules. For example, the FARC-EP reportedly
executed a leader of a community of Emberá indigenous people, Bertulfo Domicó
Domicó, near Dabeiba, Antioquia, in July, for violating local rules on travel. Paramilitaries
also targeted indigenous leaders, reputedly ordering three of them killed
near the town of La Hormiga, Putumayo, in August.
In some areas, guerrillas imposed rules regarding hair length and clothing,
including prohibiting girls and women from Medellín’s poor neighborhoods from
wearing midriff-baring shirts. In Barrancabermeja, Santander, paramilitaries
reportedly punished young people who violated similar rules by whipping them,
binding them to posts in public places for up to twenty-four hours, and shaving
their heads and facial hair.
Guerrillas sought to influence politics and raise money via kidnapping. As of
this writing, presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, seized in February 2002, remained in FARC-EP custody along with the governor of Antioquia; the former
governor of Meta; a former defense minister; Msgr. Jorge Enrique Jiménez Carvajal,
a Colombian bishop who heads the Latin American Episcopal Council
(CELAM); and hundreds of Colombians kept for ransom. Victims included children
as young as three years old, such as a girl kidnapped on July 18 in an effort to
force her father, a mayor, to resign. (The mayor had submitted his resignation
before the child was taken, but the government had refused to accept it.) According
to País Libre, a nongovernmental organization that collected information on kidnapping,
guerrillas were responsible for 58 percent of the 2,253 kidnappings
recorded in the first nine months of 2002, roughly comparable to the previous
year’s rate. Paramilitaries were linked to 6 percent.
In the first ten months of 2002, the FARC-EP used gas cylinder bombs in over
forty attacks on cities and towns, causing mainly civilian casualties.The FARC-EP’s
use of these weapons in civilian areas was a blatant breach of international law and
demonstrated a disregard for the most basic standards of respect for human life.
According to the Consultancy for Human Rights and Internal Displacement
(Consultoría para los Derechos Humanos y el Desplazamiento, CODHES), over
two hundred thousand Colombians were forcibly displaced in the first eight
months of 2002, most by paramilitaries. In addition, at least 1.2 million Colombians
permanently left the country over the past five years, according to the International
Organization on Migration. In 2001 alone, twenty-three thousand
Colombians sought asylum as refugees across international borders according to
the U.S. Committee for Refugees.
CODHES noted a dramatic increase in forced displacement provoked by the
FARC-EP. In one dramatic case, the office of the public advocate reported that
FARC-EP guerrillas forced over one thousand residents of the river hamlet of
Puerto Alvira, Meta, to abandon their homes in July, then used them as human
shields to block government forces, in violation of humanitarian law. Calling it an
“unprecedented event,” Public Advocate Eduardo Cifuentes said that investigators
also found that guerrillas had looted homes and stores.
On August 5,Colombia ratified the Rome Statute for the International Criminal
Court,bringing the number of ratifications to seventy-seven.However,before leaving
office and in coordination with incoming President Uribe, President Pastrana
invoked article 124 of the statute, which allows a state party to decline the ICC’s
competence for up to seven years for war crimes committed by one of its nationals
or on its territory. Such crimes were committed routinely by both rebel and paramilitary
forces in Colombia, as well as by the military officers who worked with
paramilitary groups.The article 124 declaration was not made public at the time of
Colombia’s ratification nor was it discussed in the Colombian Congress.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Especially in rural areas and small towns, attacks against rights defenders
remained common. In the first eleven months of 2002, sixteen defenders were
reported killed, most by groups that were not clearly identified at the time of this writing. In addition, the individuals responsible for over a decade’s worth of previous
attacks remained largely unpunished. A two-year government effort to resolve
outstanding cases, including the murders of human rights defenders, through a
special interministerial committee had yet to deliver results.
Among the year’s victims was José Rusbell Lara, a member of the “Joel Sierra”
Human Rights Committee in the department of Arauca, one of the most violent
areas of Colombia. After visiting Colombia in July, the IACHR issued precautionary
measures asking the Colombian authorities to protect the members of the
Arauca-based committee. However, effective protection measures were not taken.
Rusbell was shot and killed by presumed paramilitaries on November 8.
In a new and disturbing development, church leaders who spoke out in favor of
peace and human rights or who protested abuses were targeted by both sides, often
during mass or prayer services. For instance, guerrillas were believed responsible
for the murders of two Protestant pastors as they were preaching in a hall near San
Vicente del Caguán, Caquetá, the unofficial capital of the zone previously ceded to
guerrillas for peace talks. José Vicente Flórez, a member of the United Pentecostal
Church, was shot and killed on July 14; Abel Ruiz, also a Pentecostal minister, was
shot and killed in the same spot two weeks later.On March 16, a gunman killed Cali
Archbishop Isaias Duarte Cancino, who frequently spoke out against corruption.
In the first eleven months of 2002, eleven other priests, one nun, and eighteen
Protestant pastors were killed in Colombia,more church leaders killed in any comparable
period in the country’s recent history.
Threats against human rights defenders were serious and included threatening
telephone calls, fake invitations to the defender’s funeral, and obvious surveillance
by armed men. A frequent target was the “José Alvear Restrepo”Lawyers Collective,
which represented victims of human rights abuses,among them trade unionist and
congressional representative Wilson Borja.Prior to his election to Colombia’s lower
house, Borja survived an assassination attempt in 2000. Evidence collected since
points to the involvement of several active-duty and retired security force officers
working with paramilitaries. In May, the collective was named on posters distributed
at Bogotá’s National University, Colombia’s largest, alleging that it was
engaged in a campaign of “open persecution” against the army and represented a
“narcoterrorist organization” run by guerrillas.
There were continuing indicators that military intelligence, which kept the
names of rights defenders on file, viewed human rights work as evidence of guerrilla
sympathies. On August 16, troops from the Cali-based Third Brigade searched
the home of Jesús Antonio González Luna, the human rights director of the United
Workers Federation (Central Unificado de Trabajadores, CUT), Colombia’s main
labor federation, allegedly in search of guerrilla propaganda.Using the new powers
included in President Uribe’s emergency measures, the security forces forcibly
entered the Bogotá office of the Permanent Assembly by Civil Society for Peace, a
non-profit group dedicated to promoting peace efforts, on October 25 without the
presence of any oversight agencies.
The year 2002 was especially devastating for trade unionists. According to the
National Trade Unionist School (Escuela Nacional Sindical, ENS), 146 trade unionists
were murdered in the first ten months of the year,more than in the same period in 2001. The ENS believed that most of the killings were committed by paramilitaries,
but it noted an alarming increase in attacks by the FARC-EP, thought to be
responsible for at least nineteen of the killings. Of that number, guerrillas killed
seven in a massacre that took place on April 26 at a farm near Apartadó,Antioquia,
by far the most dangerous state for trade union activity.
The Association of Family Members of the Detained and Disappeared (Asociación
de Familiares de los Detenidos y Desaparecidos,ASFADDES) also reported
continuing threats. On July 10, men identifying themselves as police investigators
tried unsuccessfully to argue their way into an ASFADDES office in Bogotá. This
incident followed several others in which ASFADDES members received threatening
telephone calls or noted that they were being followed. Yolanda Becerra, the
director of a women’s group in Barrancabermeja, Santander, also reported threats,
most apparently made by paramilitary groups. Both groups were issued precautionary
measures by the IACHR.
Witnesses to alleged crimes remained extremely vulnerable, and government
programs to protect them remained dramatically underfunded and poorly managed.
On January 25, for example, twelve heavily armed men shot and killed Angel
Riveros Chaparro, the leader of a local peasant association.Chaparro was a witness
to the 1998 Santo Domingo incident, in which a Colombian air force helicopter
allegedly shot a rocket at civilians, killing nineteen, among them seven children.
The case remained stalled in Colombia’s military courts.
The government invested more than in years past on protection measures. A
range of officials, including the Colombian National Police and Interior Ministry,
took steps to protect defenders, providing bodyguards, police escorts, and other
measures.Nevertheless, these efforts remained dramatically underfunded and were
concentrated in large cities, meaning that defenders in outlying areas remained vulnerable.
The UNHCHR office expressed concern over the lack of resources to critical
institutions, among them the public advocate’s office and the witness protection
programs administered by the attorney general. It was also clear that prosecutors
and investigators working on human rights cases were extremely vulnerable.At the
new Human Rights Unit satellite office in Medellín, for example, prosecutors suffered
under crushing case loads, insufficient resources, poor equipment, no travel
funds, and constant tension related to the investigations themselves, which often
targeted Colombia’s most ruthless and dangerous people.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
Members of the international community, acting separately, in country
alliances, and through the European Union and the United Nations, continued to
play a critical and sometimes highly controversial role in Colombia. One of the
most high-profile contributions came during the Colombian government’s
attempt, in January and February, to salvage its ultimately unsuccessful peace talks
with the FARC-EP. Along with U.N. representative James LeMoyne, the ambassadors
of Canada, Cuba, Spain, France, Italy,Mexico, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland spent many days in the zone designated for talks, trying to facilitate the negotiating
efforts of government and guerrilla representatives.
European Union
After peace talks failed, the European Union adopted a significantly harder
stance toward the FARC-EP. In June, after sustained debate, the European Union
added the FARC-EP to its blacklist of “terrorist”organizations, in part motivated by
evidence that guerrillas had been using the zone ceded to them for talks to train
fighters and make weapons and explosives.
Three members of the Irish Republican Army, captured in 2001, remained
detained in Colombia on charges of training the FARC-EP to make sophisticated
explosives.
United Nations
The office of the UNHCHR maintained a high profile and continued to play a
critical role in documenting abuses committed by all sides. It also provided the
Colombian government with technical and other assistance related to improving
human rights protection, and training prosecutors, Internal Affairs investigators,
and members of the security forces in human rights and international humanitarian
law.
Anders Kompass, the head of the UNHCHR office in Bogotá, completed a threeyear
term and was replaced in October by Swedish diplomat Michael Fruhling.
There were moments of high tension between the office and the government. In
May, after U.N. investigators invited by the government to visit Boyajá raised questions
about the role of the security forces there, Colombian General Mario Montoya
accused the U.N. of promoting “baseless” reports and failing to help restore
stability to the area.
The U.N. special rapporteur on violence against women, Radhika Coomaraswamy,
visited Colombia in November 2001.Coomaraswamy emphasized her concerns
about sexual violence against women by illegal armed groups and the plight
of the internally displaced, the majority of whom are women and children.
United States
The United States continued to play a pivotal role in Colombia because of its status
both as the primary purchaser of the illegal narcotics produced in Colombia
and used by armed groups to finance war, and as the main supplier of military aid
to the Colombian government. In 2002, the U.S. government provided Colombia
with $374 million in military aid and, in a new development, lifted restrictions preventing
the Colombian security forces from using the funding to combat illegal
armed groups.The change revoked a long-standing requirement that funds only be
spent on antinarcotics activities. As of September 13, according to government
reports, there were 138 temporary and permanent U.S. military personnel and 250
U.S. civilians retained as individual contractors in Colombia.
The aid legislation included human rights conditions that required the Colombian
military to take effective steps to break ties with paramilitary groups, suspend
from duty officers implicated in gross human rights violations, and cooperate with
civilian authorities in prosecuting alleged human rights abusers. In the biannual
reviews required by law,Human Rights Watch and two other human rights groups
showed that Colombia had failed to meet these conditions. The State Department
pressed Colombia to make progress, and the United States suspended military assistance
for several weeks to reinforce the message. Nonetheless, Secretary of State
Colin Powell ultimately certified Colombia’s compliance with the conditions on
May 1, thereby releasing 60 percent of the funds available.The certification decision
sent a harmful message to the Colombian authorities, and particularly the armed
forces, that human rights were less important than the ability to wage war freely.
Human rights groups took part in a second round of State Department meetings
in late August, linked to the certification of the remaining 40 percent of military
aid. Human Rights Watch again demonstrated that Colombia had failed to
meet a single one of the statutory conditions and described disturbing setbacks
since the May 1 certification. Nevertheless, Deputy Secretary of State Richard
Armitage certified Colombia a second time on September 9.
As the second certification was pending, paramilitaries charged that the Colombian
army attempted to demonstrate compliance by killing twenty-four AUC fighters
on August 9 near Segovia, Antioquia, in a purported ambush. Calling it a “war
crime,” AUC leader Castaño contended that soldiers had detained, disarmed, and
then executed the men. The army denied the accusation, but investigators from the
inspector general’s office found that soldiers had significantly altered the scene of
the incident before civilian investigators arrived, raising questions about the ambush
scenario.
In a more positive development, U.S. officials more consistently stressed the
need for Colombia to pursue paramilitaries and guerrillas with equal vigor. On
September 24, U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft announced that the Justice
Department had filed an extradition request for Castaño and fellow AUC leader
Salvatore Mancuso on charges of drug trafficking, a decision that promised to provoke
further tumult before year’s end. The U.S. State Department suspended the
U.S. visa of Admiral Rodrigo Quiñones, implicated in a series of serious human
rights violations dating from 1991. In addition, the U.S. Congress authorized the
use of U.S. military assistance for the creation of a special unit of the Colombian
military dedicated to bringing paramilitary leaders to justice.
Department of Justice officials administered a $25 million program to
strengthen the capacity of the attorney general’s Human Rights Unit. A key element
of the program was the establishment of eleven satellite offices outside of Bogotá.
As of June 2002, all eleven offices were functioning, including prosecutorial teams
in Medellín, Cali, Bucaramanga,Villavicencio,Neiva, Barranquilla, and Cúcuta.
The program also funded training for prosecutors and investigators, travel
expenses, and equipment such as computers, desks, fax machines, and radios.U.S.-
funded mobile exhumation equipment was, for example, used to document the
Boyajá massacre. The state department proposed an additional $10 million for the
Human Rights Unit in the fiscal year 2003 budget, pending at this writing.
In its 2002 conference report, however, the U.S. Congress rebuked U.S. Justice
Department officials for failing to conduct appropriate consultations before buying
highly sophisticated forensics equipment for the attorney general’s office. Not
only was this equipment not compatible with other equipment already in use; as of
June 2002, two years after aid was first sent, it was still not in operation. While
arguably useful, the equipment failed to “address [the Human Rights Unit’s] priority
needs of security, mobility and communications equipment for prosecutors, in
particular for those prosecutors based in secondary cities and outlying regions,”the
U.S. Congress noted.
U.S.marshals also worked with the attorney general’s office to improve the security
provided for employees and threatened witnesses. During a June visit to
Colombia, Human Rights Watch was informed that Colombia was due to receive
sixty armored vehicles destined for threatened prosecutors and investigators, particularly
those assigned to the new satellite offices.
The United States also pressed Colombia to sign a “non-extradition” agreement
that would prohibit the extradition of U.S. and Colombian servicemen to stand
trial before the ICC. Colombia complied, in large part because the U.S. threatened
to prevent countries that were signatories to the Rome Statute and who had not
signed the immunity pledge from receiving U.S. military aid.Colombia was receiving
more military aid than any country except Israel and Egypt.
