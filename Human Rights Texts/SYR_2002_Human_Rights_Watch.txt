SYRIA
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
President Bashar al-Asad’s government launched a crackdown on peaceful but
outspoken advocates of reform in August, sending a clear message that it would tolerate
a political opening only on its own terms and according to its own timetable.
Authorities arrested leading critics and others active in the freewheeling discussion
groups, or civil society forums, that emerged as Syrians sought to claim freedoms
that had been denied them during the thirty-year rule of former president Hafez al-
Asad. The arrests reversed a trend toward greater openness in a country long dominated
by the ruling Arab Ba’th Socialist Party and institutions it controls, and
followed earlier positive developments.These included the release of some six hundred
political prisoners under a presidential amnesty in November 2000, a January
2001 announcement that the emergency law in force since 1963 was “frozen” and
“not applied,” and the release in May 2001 of Nizar Nayouf, then the last remaining
imprisoned human rights activist. In addition, the government initially relaxed
some controls on the press, but in September introduced a tough new decree that
regulated the press and other publications as part of a wider strategy to control critical
expression.
The crackdown began with the arrest of Mamoun al-Homsi, an independent
member of parliament, on August 9. Previously, the authorities did not acknowledge
or give reasons for detentions, but in this case the Interior Ministry confirmed
al-Homsi’s arrest on August 10, charging that a list of political demands that he had
issued publicly on August 7, when commencing a hunger strike at his office, constituted
“an attempt to change the constitution by illegal means, trying to stop the
authorities from carrying out their duties mentioned in the law, trying to harm
national unity, defaming the state and insulting the legislative, executive and judicial
authorities.”The ministry also alleged that al-Homsi owed almost U.S. $1 million
in back taxes and had issued his call for political changes, ranging from the
lifting of the emergency law to stronger anti-corruption measures, in order to portray
himself “as a political victim whereas in fact he is someone accused of a crime.”
Al-Homsi’s trial began in Damascus criminal court on October 30, and continued
as of mid-November.
On September 1, the authorities arrested seventy-one-year-old Riad al-Turk,
head of the unauthorized Communist Party Political Bureau and possibly Syria’s
best known former political prisoner. Official sources said he had been detained “in
accordance with Syrian criminal and penal procedure law.” The government’s al-
Thawrah newspaper reported on September 5 that he had “expressed views that
encroach upon the constitution, violate the general law, and defame the state.” By
mid-November, al-Turk was still being held, reportedly awaiting trial in the State
Security Court, whose procedures do not satisfy international fair trial standards,
including the right of appeal to a higher tribunal.
The authorities next detained Riad al-Seif, another member of parliament and
a vocal champion of political reform,on September 6.He was later charged, according
to his lawyer, with “seeking to change the constitution through illegal means,”
“inciting inter-religious division,” “forming a secret society,” and “organizing subversive
meetings” and “gatherings aimed at causing disorder.” The day before al-
Seif ’s arrest, hundreds of people had attended the National Dialogue Forum, a
weekly political gathering that he hosted at his home.Al-Seif suspended the forum
in March and opened it in September only after he was unable to obtain an official
permit. He had also planned to launch a new political party, the Movement for
Social Peace, with a platform that included ending the Ba’th party’s grip on political
power. In February, a prosecutor had questioned al-Seif about the proposed
party’s aims, and reportedly accused him of threatening the constitution and
“attempting to create a sectarian rift.” Al-Seif ’s trial commenced in the Damascus
criminal court on October 31 and continued as of mid-November.
Seven more activists were arrested and imprisoned between September 9-12.
These included prominent economist Arif Dalila, founding member of the nongovernmental
Committees for the Revival of Civil Society, and others involved in
the civil forum movement: lawyer Habib Issa, engineer Fawaz Tello, Hassan
Saadoun, and Habib Saleh. Two of those arrested, Issa and physician Walid al-
Bunni,were at the July 2 founding meeting of the independent Human Rights Society
in Syria, and physician Kamal Labwani was a member of the administrative
council of the Committees for the Defense of Human Rights. Issa was also a member
of the defense team for the detained parliamentarians and before his arrest had
spoken about the cases on the pan-Arab al-Jazeera television station. As of mid-
November, all seven were awaiting trail before the State Security Court.
In the months preceding the clampdown, senior officials signaled the government’s
increasing unease with the opening up of public debate. On January 29,
Information Minister Adnan Omran warned publicly that discussions about
reform “must be responsible,” and disparaged the term “civil society,” describing it
as “an American expression.”President Asad also took up this theme in an interview
published on February 8 in the pan-Arabic daily al-Sharq al-Awsat, stating that
civic organizations should complement and be “based on” state institutions, “not
built on their ruins,” and that in Syria “the development of civil society institutions
must come at a later stage and they are not therefore among our priorities.”
In mid-February, the government imposed controls on the independent civic forums, compromising the unprecedented freedom of assembly that Syrian
activists and their supporters had been enjoying. Meetings reportedly could no
longer be held without prior government approval, a list of participants, and a copy
of the speakers’ lectures. In March, President Asad warned further that there were
“principles in Syria which nobody should break,” citing “the Ba’th party, the armed
forces, and the policies of president Hafez al-Asad.”He added: “Challenging these
fundamentals amounts to harming the national interest . . . and serving the nation’s
enemies.”An internal Ba’th party memorandum, publicized in March, echoed the
president’s remarks. It charged ominously that groups which sought to “weaken the
state and dwarf its role” were, “intentionally or not, serving the enemies of the
homeland.”
Another human rights setback occurred on September 22,when President Asad
issued a restrictive decree governing newspapers and other periodical publications
as well as anything else printed in Syria, from books to pamphlets and posters.
Decree no. 50/2001 granted the executive, specifically, the prime minister and the
minister of information, powers to regulate publishers, printers, distributors, and
bookstores, and provided harsh criminal penalties for violations of the decree,
including substantial fines and imprisonment for up to three years.
Article 29 of the decree listed banned topics, including “details of secret trials,”
“articles and reports about national security, national unity, details of the security
and safety of the army, its movements, weapons, supplies, equipment and camps,”
and material “affecting the right to privacy.” Article 51a criminalized the publication
of “falsehoods” and “fabricated reports,” with imprisonment of one to three
years for violators and/or hefty fines. The article added, in sweepingly vague language,
that the maximum penalties “shall be imposed if such acts have been committed
by reason of ill-will, or caused public unrest, or harm to international
relations, offense to state dignity, national unity, the morale of the army and the
armed forces, or caused some damage to the national economy and the currency.”
Violators of articles 29 and 51a were further penalized with suspension of their
publications for periods of one week to six months.
The decree also prohibited “propaganda publications” financed “directly or
indirectly” by foreign countries, companies or foundations, raising concern that it
could be used to target independent civil society groups that receive funding from
abroad. Breaches of this provision brought fines and prison terms of six months to
one year.
The decree also required that all periodicals, including those of “legally established
political parties,”obtain in advance a license to publish from the prime minister,
who was empowered to deny licenses “for reasons he deems to be related to
public interest.” Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), professional associations,
and unions, however, were exempted from this licensing requirement, but it
remained to be seen if NGOs without official legal status would be permitted to
publish magazines or other periodicals.
Other provisions of the decree, set out in article 16, limited the ownership of
periodical publications to Syrian Arabs, suggesting that members of the Kurdish
minority and stateless Kurds born in Syria were excluded as well as foreigners. The
same article also barred ownership to anyone convicted of a criminal offense, stripped of civil or political rights, or “dismissed from employment,” penalties that
had been imposed on many peaceful critics of the government who were previously
imprisoned on criminal charges after State Security Court trials. The decree also
required all periodical publications to obtain Information Ministry approval
before they changed their owner, director, or chief editor, and distributors and sellers
of foreign periodicals to submit advance copies to the same ministry,which can
ban their entry or circulation if they “infringe upon national sovereignty and security
or offend public morality.”
The issue of Lebanese in secret Syrian custody, including those who were
apprehended on Lebanese soil by Lebanese or Syrian security forces and then “disappeared,”
remained unresolved, despite official Syrian government acknowledgment
that it had been holding scores of prisoners. On December 11, 2000, Syrian
authorities transferred fifty-four prisoners to Lebanon; forty-six of them were
Lebanese and eight were Palestinians. One of the Lebanese, Khaled Tawfiq, said he
had been held for thirteen years. Several days later, Lebanon’s prosecutor general
released a list of another ninety-five Lebanese who remained jailed in Syria for
alleged criminal offenses committed on Syrian territory. Despite Syrian government
assertions that the file was now closed, Lebanese human rights organizations
insisted that there were additional Lebanese held in unacknowledged detention in
Syria, including some whose relatives had managed to visit them over the years.
Other “disappeared”included twenty-six Lebanese soldiers who were last seen alive
on October 13, 1990, the day Syrian troops began fighting against forces loyal to
Gen.Michel Aoun.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Human rights organizations lacked official legal status and could be denied
authorization in arbitrary fashion under the broadly worded 1958 private associations
law, article 2, which states: “Any association which is established for an illicit
reason or purpose, or which contravenes the law or the moral code, or the purpose
of which is to prejudice the integrity or form of the republican government shall be
null and void.”The government also reported to the U.N.Human Rights Committee
(HRC) that the law placed “restrictions” on the establishment of private associations
“in order to protect public safety, national security, public order, public
health and morals and rights of others.”
One recently organized human rights group that elected its board of directors in
July told Human Rights Watch that it would seek authorization from the government
but planned to carry out activities during this process. One of the group’s
leaders said he was under surveillance by several security agencies, and that family
members had been questioned about his activities as a form of intimidation and
pressure. Another activist and former political prisoner reported that security
forces monitored his telephone and mail and that he was “not feeling safe.”
Despite such pressures and in contrast to earlier years, intellectuals and human
rights activists in Syria openly issued regular communiqués and statements, proposing
sweepings reforms and criticizing government actions. In January, over 1,000 intellectuals and others signed the Basic Document, a petition circulated by
the Committees for the Revival of Civil Society. This called for political reform,
including free elections, press freedom, the lifting of emergency law, and an end to
the Ba’th party’s political domination. The document noted “the consequences of
undermining democracy in the name of socialism,” and said that in Syria the rule
of law had been “replaced by patronage, rights by favors, and the general interest by
personal interest.”
Following the arrest of member of parliament Mamoun al-Homsi in August, the
Committees for the Defense of Human Rights issued a statement that called for his
release and urged the government to “stop using the judiciary as an instrument of
pressure or terror against political activists.” In a separate document, thirty-five
intellectuals and human rights activists also condemned the arrest and advocated
al-Homsi’s release.
Human rights activist Nizar Nayouf was released from prison in May after serving
in solitary confinement most of the ten-year prison sentence that the State
Security Court imposed in 1992. Following international publicity, he was provided
a passport and finally allowed to leave Syria in July to seek medical treatment
in France. Following his release, Nayouf campaigned for accountability for past
abuses, including torture,deaths in detention, and extrajudicial executions.He told
Human Rights Watch that while still in Syria he had formed the National Council
for Truth, Justice and Reconciliation to document abuses,press for the perpetrators
to be brought to justice, and assist former political prisoners who were stripped of
their civil and political rights and denied reemployment in their former jobs.
On September 3, Nayouf’s lawyer Anwar al-Bunni reported that lawyers from
the Ba’th party had filed a case against Nayouf, accusing him of seeking to change
the constitution by illegal means, creating sectarian strife, and publishing abroad
reports harmful to the state.Nayouf,who was still in France, was ordered to appear
before an investigating judge for questioning.
Syria remained largely closed to international human rights organizations,
although authorities permitted a representative of the New York-based Committee
to Protect Journalists to visit the country in April and May; the mission took place
without government interference.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
In March, the U.N. Human Rights Committee considered Syria’s second periodic
report on compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights (ICCPR), due since 1984. The committee criticized the long delay and the
lack of factual information in the report, expressed concern about the “quasi-permanent
state of emergency” in force since 1963, and called for lifting of the emergency
law “as soon as possible.” The committee also expressed concern about
extrajudicial executions, torture, inhumane prison conditions, and “disappearances,”
including those of Lebanese nationals taken into custody in Lebanon and
transferred to Syria.
The HRC also criticized restrictions on freedom of assembly and association,
noting that “only political parties wishing to participate in the political activities of
the National Progressive Front, led by the Ba’th party, are allowed,” and the denial
of passports to many Syrian exiles and their children, urging the government to
“facilitate the return to the country of all Syrian citizens wishing to do so.” The
committee also urged the authorities to urgently “find a solution to the statelessness
of numerous Kurds in Syria and to allow Kurdish children born in Syria to acquire
Syrian nationality.”
With regard to the death penalty, the HRC called for a reduction in the number
of offenses punishable by death and asked the government to provide within
one year the number of death sentences passed since 1990, the names of those
condemned and the grounds on which they were sentenced, and the dates of
executions.
European Union
Commercial ties between Syria and the European Union (E.U.) remained strong
but these links did not yield any sustained advocacy on the long-overdue need for
human rights improvements, including basic rights such as freedom of expression
and association. The E.U. was Syria’s main trading partner, with the trade balance
in favor of Damascus. Some 60 percent of Syrian exports, primarily petroleum
products and cotton,were destined for E.U. states,with Italy, Germany, and France
leading the importers. Thirty-one percent of Syria’s imports were from the E.U.,
with Italy, Germany , and France also the major suppliers.
The government made clear that it sought substantial European financial aid to
upgrade the manufacturing sector and increase its competitiveness. On April 4, Dr.
Muhamed Tawfiq Simaq, who heads Syria’s Industry Committee, said the country
required some $5.6 billion for a ten-year industrial development plan and “we
expect the E.U. to provide generous assistance.”
Syria and the European Union continued to negotiate a Euro-Mediterranean
Association Agreement, an economic pact designed to result in a free trade zone.
Five rounds of talks took place between May 1998 and December 2000, and the
negotiations continued in 2001. Prior to the launch of two days of negotiations in
Damascus in April, a senior government official voiced dissatisfaction at what was
apparently perceived as E.U. pressure over political and economic issues. “We
believe that the development of democracy should be based on the national development
[of the country] and not result from foreign diktats, and that is where one
of the problems in the negotiations lies,” Issam Zaim, Syria’s state planning minister
of state, was quoted as saying. The head of the E.U. delegation in Syria, Marc
Pierini, responded that “there was nothing in the substance of the project for an
[association] accord, nor in the character or style of the negotiations which could
lead one to think of a diktat.”Association agreements included standard language
specifying that the agreements were premised on “respect for human rights and
democratic values.”
Apparent tensions with respect to the pace of economic reform led the E.U. to
publish a statement noting that “Syria has decided itself that it needed to reform its
economy,” and that the E.U. was “not trying to impose any kind of formula on it.”
The E.U. position, the statement said, was that “a sustained rhythm of reforms”was
“an essential signal to the outside world” needed to attract investment.
United States
The U.S. offered little in the way of public criticism of Syria’s human rights practices,
which the State Department once again assessed as “poor.” The Bush administration
seemed more concerned to use any leverage it did have to press the
government to adhere to U.N. supervision of the Iraq sanctions regime as bilateral
relations warmed considerably between Syria and Iraq, and to keep a close watch
on the volatile Lebanon-Israel border, where Hizballah guerrillas continued to
attack Israeli military forces in support of Syrian and Lebanese government claims
that the disputed Shebaa Farms area, in the foothills of the Israeli-annexed Golan
Heights, was Lebanese, not Syrian, territory occupied by Israel.
On January 23, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that U.S.
officials had discussions with the Syrian government about the reopening in
November 2000 of the oil pipeline from Iraq to the Syrian Mediterranean port of
Banias. Boucher said that the U.S. would support a Syrian request to have the
pipeline named as an official route for Iraq’s oil exports, under the supervision of
the U.N.’s oil for food program.
Edward Walker, assistant secretary of state in the State Department’s Bureau of
Near Eastern Affairs, discussed Syria in testimony on March 29 before the subcommittee
on the Middle East and South Asia of the House of Representatives Committee
on International Relations. He cited as positive developments the
government’s pledge to the U.S. to submit to U.N. supervision of its oil trade with
Iraq, and said that economic reform initiatives, particularly in the banking sector,
represented “the beginning of movement in the right direction.” Secretary Walker
made no comments about political reform or human rights, although he criticized
President Asad as being “intractable on the question of Israel,” called his statement
at the March 27 Arab League summit meeting in Amman “unacceptable,” and said
that the “jury is still out on Mr. Bashar.” In his speech, President Asad termed Israel
“a racist society and more racist than Nazism.”
Syria remained one of the seven countries on the U.S. list of state sponsors of
international terrorism. The State Department’s patterns of global terrorism
report, released in April 2000, said that Syria “appeared to maintain its longstanding
ban on attacks launched from Syrian territory or against Western targets,” and
“generally upheld its agreement with [Turkey] not to support the Kurdish PKK.”
But the report also charged that Syria “continued to provide safe haven and support
to several terrorist groups, some of which maintained training camps or other facilities
on Syrian territory.”The report noted that the Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC), the Palestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ),
Fatah-the-Intifada, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)
“maintained their headquarters in Damascus,” and that Hamas was permitted “to
open a new main office in Damascus in March, although the arrangement may be
temporary while Hamas continues to seek permission to reestablish its headquarters
in Jordan.”The State Department said that Syria “granted a variety of terrorist groups—including Hamas, the PFLP-GC, and the PIJ—basing privileges or refuge
in areas of Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley under Syrian control.” It also said that Syria “did
not act to stop Hizballah and Palestinian rejectionist groups from carrying out
anti-Israeli attacks,”and that “Damascus also served as the primary transit point for
terrorist operatives traveling to Lebanon and for the resupply of weapons to
Hizballah.”
In the wake of the September 11 attacks in New York and Washington, which
Syria condemned, newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to Syria Theodore Kattouf
met in Damascus with Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara’. According to a Syrian
official quoted by Reuters, the topics of discussion at the September 15 meeting
included “bilateral cooperation,”among other issues. The Syrian government publicly
insisted on a distinction between terrorism, which it said it opposed, and
resistance to foreign occupation, presumably by the Palestinian and Lebanese
groups that it supported. On October 11, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard
Armitage was asked about the consequences for countries such as Syria that did not
satisfy U.S. requests for cooperation in the global anti-terrorism effort. “The consequences
might be whatever the coalition finds worthy and it runs the gamut from
isolation to financial investigation, all the way up through possibly military action.”
At a press conference later that day, President Bush appeared to soften Armitage’s
remarks: “The Syrians have talked to us about how they can help in the war against
terrorism . . . [W]e take that seriously and we’ll give them an opportunity to do so.”
The next day, Syria’s Foreign Ministry reportedly summoned Ambassador Kattouf
and protested Armitage’s statement.
