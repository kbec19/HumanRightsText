SAUDI ARABIA
Following the attacks on New York and Washington on September 11, 2001,
Saudi Arabia faced the most sustained international scrutiny in its modern
history.Despite massive media attention and liberal access granted to Western journalists,
detailed information about human rights violations remained elusive. The
continuing absence of a local human rights movement and the government’s policy
of keeping the kingdom closed to investigators from international human rights
organizations contributed to the information shortage, as did the Interior Ministry’s
effective use of harassment and intimidation to keep human rights victims
and their advocates silent. Interior Ministry operatives also pressured families of
perceived critics and in several documented cases security officials detained close
relatives without charge.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
The broad features of the kingdom’s human rights landscape remained
unchanged. Saudi Arabia lacked independent national institutions to question,
criticize or hold accountable the all-powerful executive branch of government controlled
by the royal family. The appointed Consultative Council (majlis al-shura)
had a limited role and was no substitute for an elected parliament with independent
oversight powers. Political groups of any kind were not permitted and demonstrations
were banned.Meetings and public assemblies required permission of the
authorities. Procedures to obtain legal status for nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs) remained cumbersome and opaque, with independent groups unable to
establish themselves. The department of statistics disclosed on August 9 that 50
percent of the Saudi population was under the age of fifteen. It remained unclear
how authorities were prepared to accommodate this educated and potentially
restive population in the coming years, since students were not permitted to organize
groups to articulate their concerns.
Freedom of expression, including press freedom, was limited, and authorities
took punitive measures against journalists and others viewed as too outspoken.The
King Abdul Aziz Center for Science and Technology controlled access to the Internet.
Users were unable to reach sites that authorities blocked for political or “moral”
reasons. There were no independent women’s rights organizations to give voice to
gender issues, such as discrimination in the legal and education systems and sharp
restrictions on women’s freedom of movement. Similarly, the kingdom had no
NGOs to advocate for the rights of religious minorities—notably, Shiite and Ismaili
Muslims who faced serious discrimination—or the kingdom’s estimated six million
to seven million foreign workers. Senior government officials refused to give
credence to reports of human rights violations and reacted defensively when such
information was publicized internationally.
On the positive side, the newly adopted code of criminal procedure came into
force on May 1.The law represented an important step toward greater transparency
in the administration of the criminal justice system by specifying legal procedures
and due-process rights. Notably, it prohibited torture and other forms of ill treatment,
stated clearly that persons arrested or detained must be promptly informed
of the charges against them, and acknowledged the right of criminal suspects to the
assistance of lawyers during investigation proceedings and trial. It also provided for
oversight of prisons and other places of detention by members of the Public Investigation
and Prosecution Department to ensure that no one was detained or
imprisoned in an unlawful manner.
Some of the code’s provisions were at odds with international human rights
standards, such as article 33, which stated that suspects must establish their innocence
to the satisfaction of non-judicial authorities within the first twenty-four
hours of arrest or face the prospect of long-term detention.Despite the code’s various
deficiencies, it nevertheless provided important benchmarks for assessing the
practices of internal security and police forces, public prosecutors, and other officials.
But without an active network of human rights lawyers or an effective civil rights association serving citizens and foreign residents alike, it remained to be seen
how compliance with the code will be monitored and how violations of it will be
addressed. It also remained unclear how the government planned to educate the
public about the new law. Saudi citizens interviewed by Human Rights Watch during
the year had no knowledge of the code or the specific rights it guaranteed.
Westerners continued to be targeted and killed in mysterious car bombings,
which the government maintained were not the work of Saudis. On June 20,British
banker Simon Veness died in Riyadh when his car exploded on the way to work.
Nine days later, also in Riyadh, an American couple discovered a bomb under their
car before it detonated. On September 29, German worker W.Maximilian Graf was
killed in Riyadh when his car exploded. Prince Nawwaf bin Abdulaziz, director of
the General Intelligence Department, called it an “isolated” incident and not “a terrorist
[act] against foreigners in the kingdom.”
Torture under interrogation of political prisoners and criminal suspects continued.
One Saudi prisoner, released in 2002 after being held for six years without
charge or trial by the Interior Ministry’s General Directorate of Investigation (popularly
called mabahith in Arabic), said that as a condition of release he was forced
to sign a pledge that he would not speak or write to anyone about what he witnessed.
In a document provided to Human Rights Watch he described how
detainees were tortured, including “beating with sticks, whips, and electric cables;
use of a revolving electric chair until the victim loses consciousness and begins to
vomit; sleep deprivation for long periods, up to one week; and forcing the victim to
stand on one leg and raise one arm for extended periods.”He also alleged that prisoners
were subjected to “sexual harassment by threat or the actual practice [of]
inserting an iron rod in the rectum,” and held in “solitary confinement for more
than four months, in some cases in a windowless room less than two meters square
and without ventilation.”Human Rights Watch also received credible information
concerning the physical and psychological torture meted out to five Britons and
one Canadian imprisoned as suspects in bombings of Westerners that began in
November 2000. (See below.) Techniques included: continuous sleep deprivation
for up to ten days; abrupt slapping on the face and punches to the body; forcing
them to stand while their hands were shackled to the top of a door; hanging them
upside down,with their hands and feet shackled; and threats to harm their relatives
if they did not agree to sign dictated confessions.
In September, British citizen Ron Jones, a forty-nine-year-old accountant, initiated
legal action to sue the Saudi government for false imprisonment and torture
during his sixty-seven days of detention in 2001. He was injured in a bombing in
Riyadh in March 2001; within twenty-four hours Jones was removed from his hospital
bed and detained by the Interior Ministry as a suspect, according to The
Guardian (London). “They said they knew I was part of the bombing circle, that I
had planted the bomb, and that if I didn’t admit it they would torture me until I
confessed,” Jones told the newspaper.
Secret and wholly irregular trials of Saudis and foreigners continued. In some
cases, it appeared that the defendants themselves were not aware that a trial was in
progress, since they were asked to do no more than verify that a signed confession
was their own. In February,Prince Nayef said that the case of seven foreigners—five Britons, one Canadian, and one Belgian charged with the anti-Western bombings—
was “before the judiciary.”He provided no additional details.Human Rights
Watch learned that the defendants were secretly tried and sentenced without the
notification or presence of their Saudi defense lawyers. Nor were the lawyers
informed when the Court of Cassation and the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC)
reviewed and approved the sentences—reportedly eight years for Belgian Raf
Schyvens, eighteen years for Britons Pete Brandon, James Cottle, James Lee, and Les
Walker, and the death penalty for Briton Alexander Mitchell and Canadian William
Sampson. In a special written appeal to the SJC after it upheld the sentences, the
lawyers made clear that they had no opportunity to defend their clients while the
legal proceedings were underway; that the only evidence presented was coerced
confessions obtained under torture; and that judges ignored defendants’ claims of
coerced confessions and did not request investigations. The lawyers also pointed
out that similar car bombings of Westerners continued after the arrest of their
clients, citing the June 20 attack that killed a Briton in Riyadh.
Deputy Interior Minister Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz revealed on June 13 that
some of the suspects in the 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers, in which 19 U.S.
Air Force personnel were killed, were tried in a court of first instance. He did not
disclose the dates of the trial or the names or number of defendants. He provided
few details other than that the group “did not include non-Saudi nationals.” The
prince said the “sentences will go to a higher court, then to the Supreme Judicial
Council and then to the king for approval,” adding vaguely that the verdicts would
be “announced at the appropriate time.”
Authorities continued to detain without charge relatives of perceived critics.
Kamil al-Ahmed, the younger brother of Saudi activist Ali al-Ahmed,who founded
the U.S.-based nongovernmental Saudi Institute in 2000, was arrested at his home
in Safwa on September 13, 2001.He was held without charge in a mabahith detention
facility in Dammam.More recently, internal security forces detained the son
of Dr. Said bin Zuair, an academic and political prisoner who has been held without
charge since March 1995. The son, Saad, had campaigned for his father’s
release, speaking on the widely watched al-Jazeera television station on several
occasions and writing about the case in Internet discussion forums.He was arrested
on July 4 at Riyadh airport, reportedly en route to Qatar for an interview on al-
Jazeera.He was taken to al-Ha’ir prison, where his father was also being held.As of
this writing, there was no information about any legal basis for his arrest.
The rights of Saudi women and girls remained captive to the kingdom’s patriarchal
social-cultural traditions as well as conservative interpretations of shari’a
(Islamic law).Women did not enjoy freedom of movement and required permission
from their fathers, husbands, or other close male relatives to travel inside the
kingdom or abroad. Some 3,500 members of the Committee to Promote Virtue and
Prevent Vice, or religious police, enforced the mandatory dress code for women. In
May, the Commerce Ministry confirmed that it was coordinating with the religious
police to clamp down on local factories that made abayas (the traditional formless
black cloaks that were regulation public attire for Saudi women) that officials considered
risqué. The garments were reportedly becoming popular in some Saudi
cities.Authorities were prepared to confiscate and destroy the new abayas and take “punitive measures” against their owners, according to a May 2 story in Arab News.
The ongoing ban on women driving caused economic hardship in some families
and tremendous inconvenience for young graduates of teacher colleges
assigned to schools in outlying districts. The government began in November 2001
to issue photo identification cards to women for the first time, although it did so
“very quietly without any publicity in the press or the state-run radio and TV,”
Agence France-Presse reported on December 2, 2001.Women reportedly required
the written permission of a spouse or other male guardian to obtain the cards.
Some Saudi women dismissed the move as “window dressing” for the West, making
no real difference in their lives. “You still need your husband’s or male
guardian’s permission to apply for a job, be admitted to a hospital, and travel anywhere
inside or abroad. Without their approval, you cannot do anything,” one
Riyadh-based educated mother of three told Human Rights Watch. The national
policy of gender segregation limited education and employment opportunities for
women and girls, although they were enrolled in numbers proportionate to men
and boys at all levels of the education system, including universities.Women were
not permitted to study engineering and were barred from attending the prestigious
King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, which trained a male student
body of some seven thousand for jobs in the energy industry.
Blatant gender discrimination meant that Saudi women and girls (Saudi law sets
no minimum age for marriage) were not permitted to marry non-Muslims and
could not pass on their Saudi citizenship to their children from non-Saudi fathers.
Foreigners married to or divorced from Saudi men faced an added discriminatory
burden: They were not permitted to enter the kingdom to visit their children without
the written permission of the fathers, who had to file a “statement of no objection”
with the Interior Ministry as a condition for granting a visa, according to the
U.S. State Department January 2002 report on international parental child abduction.
The tragic fire at an overcrowded and unsafe public school for girls in Mecca on
March 11, in which fifteen were killed, precipitated a public uproar in the kingdom
and unprecedented critical press coverage of the religious police and the General
Presidency for Girls Education (GPGE), the conservative agency responsible for
policymaking and administration of female education. A March 25 royal decree
forced GPGE head Ali bin Murshid al-Murshid into early retirement and merged
the GPGE with the Ministry of Education, ending its historic autonomy. But senior
government officials appeared reluctant to take on the religious police, whom
eyewitnesses criticized for hampering rescue efforts at the school because the fleeing
girls were not properly attired in the customary abayas and head coverings. On
March 24, Interior Minister Prince Nayef implicitly defended the religious police,
stating: “The fire was extinguished by the civil defence [force] within five minutes.”
He then criticized the Saudi press for inaccurate reporting: “Have those who
reported the incident been competent and responsible? Sorrowfully no. Every correspondent
wanted to satisfy his newspaper [by] exaggerating.” On April 9, Prince
Saud bin Fahd, deputy chief of intelligence, said: “Investigations into the fire incident
proved that the [religious police] had done nothing wrong.”
The public controversy surrounding the Mecca fire had broader implications for the local press. Prince Nayef met with newspaper editors and “scolded them for
crossing lines concerning religion,” the Associated Press reported from Riyadh on
April 24, citing a source who attended the meeting. This informal control of the
press from the top, influencing coverage and content, was noted by Saudi journalism
professor Suleiman al-Shammari,whom the Associated Press quoted as saying:
“The government acts like the media’s doorman, especially when it comes to foreign
policy, opening and closing the door when it wishes.”
Muhamed Mukhtar al-Fal, editor in chief of the daily al-Madina, was dismissed
from his post in March, reportedly on orders of the interior minister. The action
came after the newspaper published “The Corrupt on Earth,” a poem of Saudi
writer and poet Abdel Mohsen Mosallam. The poem lambasted corrupt judges,
stating in part: “Your beards are smeared with blood. You indulge a thousand
tyrants and only the tyrant do you obey.”Mosallam was arrested on March 18, eight
days after the newspaper published his poem. He was held for eighteen days without
charge in a mubahith office in Riyadh and was not mistreated during his detention.
As of this writing, he was blacklisted, unable to publish in Saudi newspapers,
and banned from traveling.Al-Fal was not reinstated to his post but was not banned
from writing.
The government did not respect the rights of religious minorities in the kingdom,
whether these communities were Saudi or expatriate. In April 2000, Ismaili
Shiite Muslims in the southern province of Najran protested the storming and closure
of a mosque, leading to violent clashes with Saudi security forces and mass
arrests. In December 2001, Ismaili elders in Najran issued a public statement,
charging that ninety-three Ismailis remained imprisoned and seventeen of them
faced the death penalty, adding that they were being held “for opposing the condition
of degradation, repression and humiliation that is practiced against them and
their tribesmen by Saudi authorities because of their faith.” Subsequent unconfirmed
reports said the death sentences had been commuted to life imprisonment.
On January 9, 2002, the Wall Street Journal published an article from Najran discussing
discrimination against the Ismaili minority. It quoted tribal leader Sheikh
Ahmed Turki al-Sa’ab,who said: “We love our country, but we believe that the government
is making a mistake against us.” Although this was his only quote in the
article, he was reportedly arrested on January 15 and on April 23 sentenced to seven
years imprisonment and flogging. On February 25, the Wall Street Journal reported
that two other Ismaili tribal leaders, Sheikh Hamad Ali Daseeny, a retired geologist,
and Hamad Qulayyan al-Zbaidy, had been detained on February 4.
Members of the kingdom’s Shi’a Muslim minority, numbering about one million—
six percent of the Saudi population—continued to assert that the government
practiced severe forms of discrimination against them, including toleration
of hate speech from the pulpits of Sunni Muslim mosques and from educators in
public schools. The Interior Ministry targeted outspoken peaceful critics, harassed
them in interrogation sessions, and threatened them with sanctions including loss
of their jobs.
Christian residents of the kingdom were not permitted any public display of
their faith.The government did not allow churches of any Christian denomination
to occupy public space, in sharp contrast to the large number of churches allowed in nearby Dubai. Asian and African Christians suspected of proselytizing Saudi
Muslims were arrested and imprisoned in harsh conditions, and pressured to convert
to Islam as a condition of release. Two U.S.-based groups, International Christian
Concern and Middle East Concern, publicized the arrest and detention
between July and September 2001 in Jeddah of eleven foreign nationals—from
India, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and the Philippines.They reportedly were held for practicing
their religion in their homes. One of them, Dennis Moreno-Lacalla, a Filipino
who worked in the kingdom for sixteen years, was arrested in Jeddah in August
2001 and held without charge until his release seven months later. He said that he
witnessed the flogging of three Ethiopian Christians—Tinsaie Gizachew, Bahru
Menguistu, and Gebeyahu Tafera—in January 2002, reporting that the men were
“kicked, suspended with chains, and lashed 80 times with a steel rod cable about
one inch in diameter,” punishment that left them bleeding and in severe pain.
The government took action to move the kingdom slightly closer to compliance
with international labor standards when Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Dr.
Ali al-Namlah authorized on April 17 the creation of “labor committees” at companies
with one hundred or more employees, although foreign workers were barred
from committee membership. International Labor Organization (ILO) Director
General Juan Somavía described it as “a milestone in the labor history of Saudi Arabia.”
The ILO also reported that a second expert team completed consultations with
the Labor Ministry in April concerning a new labor law,which it said would be submitted
to the kingdom’s appointed Consultative Council (majlis al-shura) “in the
near future.”
Despite this positive development, foreign workers in the kingdom—particularly
Arabs and South Asians in low-wage occupations, including women domestic
workers—remained extremely vulnerable to poor working conditions and other
abuse at the hands of their employers, who typically held their passports and official
residence permits (iqama, in Arabic).With these documents essentially confiscated,
these workers had limited freedom of movement. They were unable to leave
the country unless their employment sponsors requested an exit visa, and were subjected
to arrest and steep fines if stopped without residence permits in their possession.
Foreigner workers comprised about 65 percent of the private sector labor
force, the U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs
reported in February.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
The absence of freedom of association, coupled with strict limits on freedom of
expression, left Saudi citizens and other residents of the kingdom without the ability
to report openly about human rights conditions. There were no independent
rights organizations, including women’s rights groups, despite signing the Convention
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women
(CEDAW) in 2000.The U.N. special rapporteur on the independence of judges and
lawyers, during an official mission to Saudi Arabia in October (see below), reported
that the government was “proposing the establishment of a national human rights
institution.”
Some Saudi citizens who suffered rights abuses, or collected information about
such abuses, communicated to the outside world in clandestine fashion for fear of
punishment at the hands of authorities. Human Rights Watch received information
in 2002 from individuals who were summoned to the Interior Ministry and
questioned at length about publicizing human rights abuses and contacting international
human rights groups. Such harassment and intimidation enforced their
silence, leaving them frightened and fearful of arrest or dismissal from their public-
sector jobs.
The kingdom remained closed to international human rights organizations
during the year. As of this writing, Saudi authorities did not respond to Human
Rights Watch’s longstanding requests to visit. Amnesty International was similarly
denied. In December 2001, Lieutenant-General Ali Hussein al-Harithi, head of the
Interior Ministry’s General Directorate of Prisons, told al-Sharq al-Awsat newspaper
that Amnesty International and other groups were welcome to visit at “any
time.”He added: “We have nothing to hide or fear. [They] will find that the reality
of our prisons and inmates does not conform with what is rumored or said about
them.” A Human Rights Watch letter to the government following up on these
remarks went unanswered.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
Pursuant to an invitation first extended in 2000, the first official visit to Saudi
Arabia by a U.N. special rapporteur took place in 2002. Dato’ Param
Cumaraswamy, special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers,
conducted an official mission October 20-27.He met with senior government officials
and examined law, policy, and practice in the kingdom’s administration of justice.
He offered preliminary observations in a statement to the press in Riyadh on
October 27, noting that the justice system was “currently in a stage of transition.”
Cumaraswamy said that there was “some resistance on the part of some judges to
the presence of lawyers in their courts” and that the kingdom lacked “a culture of
legal representation in the courts but this may soon be rectified.”He expressed concern
about “the frequent reliance on confessional evidence before the courts to
prove an offense” and “the lack of compliance with some international standards of
due process,” including “the right of anyone deprived of their liberty by arrest or
detention to be promptly brought before a court to ensure the legality of their continuing
detention.”He said he learned that women represented about half the graduates
of university law faculties and that there were “no restrictions on them
appearing as lawyers before the courts.”He stated that “[m]ore women should be
encouraged [to] seek admission to the legal profession and practice before the
courts.” The special rapporteur was scheduled to report his findings at the fiftyninth
session of the Commission on Human Rights in March 2003.
U.N.High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHRC) Ruud Lubbers conducted his
first mission to Saudi Arabia October 11-14.He had meetings with senior government
officials to discuss Rafha refugee camp and the kingdom’s possible accession to the 1951 Refugee Convention. On October 14, he visited Rafha camp, where
5,200 Iraqi refugees have remained in limbo since the end of the 1991 Gulf war,
neither resettled nor repatriated to Iraq. The United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) said in an October 15 press release that Lubbers told the
refugees that UNHCR wanted “to help them find a solution to their long exile”
through resettlement in third countries or local integration, if they did not wish to
return to Iraq.He noted that the camp was “a remote site”and that the refugees were
afforded “only occasional access to the nearby town.”
As part of its obligations under the U.N.Convention Against Torture and Other
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the government submitted
an initial report to the U.N. Committee against Torture. The committee considered
this report during its twenty-eighth session in April and May 2002, and
issued concluding observations and comments on May 28. Among the subjects of
concern, the committee noted the lack of criminal sanctions in Saudi domestic law
for the crime of torture; corporal punishment, including flogging and amputation
of limbs; prolonged incommunicado detention, including lack of access to legal
and medical assistance; minimal judicial supervision of pre-trial detention; and
prolonged pre-trial detention and denial of consular access to detained foreigners
for extended periods. The committee also found that the powers of the religious
police were “vaguely defined by law, and that their activities may violate the Convention.”
It concluded that Saudi Arabia failed “to provide effective mechanisms to
investigate complaints of breaches of the Convention [against Torture],” stating
that “as a practical matter” compensation to individuals for violations of the convention
was “rarely obtained,” thus limiting “full enjoyment of the rights guaranteed
by the Convention”.
United States
Despite political tension in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the U.S.
and Saudi Arabia maintained close economic and military ties. Shared economic
interests included improvement of the stability and reliability of the international
oil market. The kingdom’s “capacity to mitigate [oil] supply disruptions in any
region,” was noted by Alan P. Larson, under secretary of state for economic, business
and agricultural affairs, in an April 22 speech.
The bilateral trade relationship was substantial. In 2001, the kingdom exported
$13.3 billion to the U.S., mostly crude oil and other petroleum products. Saudi Arabia
remained the largest market in the Middle East for U.S. products, importing
$5.9 billion. The kingdom’s defense spending “increased by 50.8 percent in 2001,
reversing a 30 percent decrease between 1998 and 2000,” according to Allied Contributions
to the Common Defense, published in June by the U.S. Department of
Defense (DOD). DOD’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency reported on September
26 that in fiscal year 2001 the U.S. government’s Foreign Military Sales
(FMS) program delivered $2.03 billion to Saudi Arabia and concluded FMS agreements
of another $587 million. Arms exports from U.S. companies in the same
period totaled $1.02 billion. Formal military ties included a U.S.Military Training
Mission to assist Saudi forces with procured U.S. weapons and a similar training mission with the kingdom’s National Guard.An estimated 6,600 U.S. military personnel,
mostly air force, and an undisclosed number of aircraft, were stationed in
Saudi Arabia.
Official statements from both governments de-emphasized bilateral political
tensions during the year concerning Afghanistan, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
and the U.S.-led campaign to use military force to overthrow the government of
Saddam Hussein.There appeared to be a tacit agreement to highlight mutual interests,
such as counterterrorism, trade, and energy sources.The U.S. repeatedly made
clear that it was willing to assist Saudi Arabia in its longstanding bid to join the
World Trade Organization, and that it hoped for a positive outcome from the Saudi
government’s protracted negotiations of a $20 billion natural gas exploration and
development deal with seven international energy companies, four of which were
U.S.-based: Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips, Marathon Oil Corporation, and Occidental
Petroleum Corporation. The other multinationals were BP, Royal
Dutch/Shell, and TotalFinaElf.
Senior U.S. officials maintained a distinct public silence about the royal family’s
autocratic rule and the persistent pattern of serious human rights violations in the
kingdom.Meanwhile, representatives of both governments affirmed publicly that
ties remained strong. Crown Prince Abdullah, de facto head of state, made an official
visit to the U.S. and met with President Bush on April 25 at his ranch in Texas.
The president said that the meeting “confirmed the strong relationship” between
the U.S. and the kingdom.He added: “And we’re constantly working with him and
his government on intelligence-sharing and cutting off money.”On August 12,U.S.
State Department spokesman Philip Reeker said: “[W]e’ve been very pleased with
the level of Saudi cooperation in the international campaign against terrorism.”His
comments came after Iran arrested and transferred to the kingdom sixteen Saudi
citizens, all alleged al-Qaeda members. On September 20, the Saudi embassy in
Washington stated that the government had “blocked more than $700 million in
suspected terrorist assets.”
Bush administration officials scrambled to distance themselves from the controversial
July 10 briefing given by Rand Corporation analyst Laurent Muraweic to
the U.S. Defense Policy Board, which provides advice to the U.S. Defense Department.
He charged that Saudi Arabia was “active at every level of the terror chain”
and “supports our enemies and attacks our allies.” U.S. Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld said on August 6 that Murawiec’s analysis “did not represent the views of
the government; it didn’t represent the views of the Defense Policy Board.”
On October 7, the State Department issued the 2002 International Religious
Freedom Report, which found, as in past reports, that freedom of religion did not
exist in Saudi Arabia, the government prohibited the public practice of non-Muslim
religions, and “continued to detain non-Muslims engaged in worship services.”
