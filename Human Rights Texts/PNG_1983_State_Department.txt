 PAPUA NEW GUINEA
 Papua New Guinea is the largest and most populous island country in
 the South Pacific. Its federal, parliamentary form of government
 is generally modeled on that of Australia; however, it has a
 unicameral legislature and the division of powers between the
 central and provincial governments is still evolving. Political
 legitimacy rests on popular will expressed in majority vote; this
 conforms both with the Constitution, which was drafted following
 extensive public consultation, and with Melanesian tradition, which
 accords prestige based on individual accomplishments rather than
 heredity. The armed forces, police, and intelligence service are
 under civilian control; the courts are independent and vigorously
 protect individual rights. The two transfers of power since
 independence in 1975 have been peaceful.
 The economic system has three parts:  The privately controlled
 money economy; the traditional rural, subsistence economy which
 supports about 80 percent of the population; and enterprises in
 which the Government has invested. The private sector produces
 most of the wealth and provides three-fourths of government
 revenues; the Government of Australia contributes most of the
 remainder.
 In 1983, constitutional protection of individual rights was
 strengthened by several court actions: civil damages were awarded
 for mistreatment of a prisoner; two policemen were jailed for
 assaulting a suspect; the maximum security wing of the country's
 main prison was closed by court order until explicit operational
 rules were drafted; and a national court rejected an official
 report on the death of a prisoner and is conducting an inquest into
 allegations that the death resulted from a beating.
 Acting on complaints of election law violations following the 1982
 parliamentary election, the courts have intervened to protect the
 integrity of the electoral system. District courts overturned the
 outcomes in two constituencies where the races were close and law
 infringements, though small, were judged sufficient to affect the
 results.
 In 1983 as in previous years, no significant complaints of human
 rights violations occurred in Papua New Guinea. Some members of
 the public and of Parliament favor compromising individual rights
 to strengthen governmental control over tribal fighting and urban
 crime. To date, however, no erosion of those rights has occurred,
 and the growing legal profession, active churches, a lively press,
 and informed public opinion are conscious of the value of
 protecting freedoms.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Substantive and procedural legal safeguards are strictly observed.
 Neither the Government nor any organized group has resorted to
 political violence.
 b. Disappearance
 Forced disappearance of persons does not occur in Papua New Guinea.

 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution forbids torture and cruel or degrading treatment.
 Treatment of prisoners is almost always fair and humane. The
 courts and Ombudsman Commission investigate the small number of
 complaints and intervene when abuses are discovered. Civil damages
 have been awarded and offending officials punished in such cases.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Politically motivated arrests do not occur in Papua New Guinea, and
 the courts vigorously enforce constitutional protections against
 arbitrary arrest or detention. Exile is not practiced. Warrants
 are required for arrests. Suspects have free access to a lawyer of
 their choice, and in serious cases counsel is provided at state
 expense. Suspects and their counsel are informed of charges and
 have the right of judicial review of detention. A reasonable bail
 is allowed, except when a judge rules that the risk of flight or
 further crime warrants detention.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair, public trial is strictly observed. Defendants
 are represented by counsel. A shortage of police and judicial
 personnel has caused the time spent awaiting trial for serious
 offenses to increase in recent years from four months to nine. The
 courts are free from executive, political, or military
 interference. There are no political prisoners in Papua New Guinea.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Sanctity of the home and family and privacy of correspondence are
 legally guaranteed and strictly observed.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 An independent press, effective legal guarantees, and a functioning
 democratic political system combine to insure freedom of speech and
 press. Takeover of one newspaper by another reduced the number of
 news publishers to two; however, competition between them is keen.
 State-owned radio gives significant if not equal coverage to
 statements of opposition politicians.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of association is legally guaranteed and freely
 exercised. Labor unions are protected by law and are active and
 important in the country's economic life. Over 50 trade unions
 exist, among which the most significant are the various public
 employees' associations, the two mineworkers' unions, and the
 dockworkers' union. The private sector unions are free to strike
 and do so. Employers' associations also flourish. There is a
 legal requirement that a permit be obtained before a
 demonstration. However, only one recent case is known in which an
 application for a permit was denied.
 
 
 853
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed by law. There are no controls on
 the practice of religion and no religious discrimination. A wide
 variety of indigenous and Christian denominations flourish.
 Missionaries are allowed to work freely in the country and their
 contributions to spiritual life are widely and favorably recognized.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement of Papua New Guinea citizens within or into and
 out of the country is not restricted by law. Naturalization is
 available to foreign residents who satisfy a residence requirement
 and are sponsored by a village, and can be revoked only for fraud.
 Some economic privileges are reserved for native citizens. Persons
 who enter Papua New Guinea without documentation from the
 neighboring Indonesian Province of Irian Jaya are interviewed in
 order to establish the reasons for their entry. Current practice
 is to return those who come for economic reasons and to find refuge
 through the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for those
 judged likely to suffer reprisals if returned home.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 PapuaNew Guinea politics are marked by keen competition for
 offices and a loose party structure. Two peaceful changes of
 government have taken place since independence. Two parliamentary
 elections produced substantial turnovers of members. The Cabinet
 includes representatives from all 19 provinces. An Ombudsman
 Gommission monitors campaign contributions.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no allegations by international or non-governmental
 agencies of human rights violations in Papua New Guinea.
 Currently, a representative of the UNHCR is resident in Port
 Moresby and monitors the treatment of refugees from Irian Jaya. No
 domestic human rights monitoring groups exist. The Ombudsman
 Commission and the courts take legal action against abuses, and the
 press and concerned politicians and citizens speak out. Papua New
 Guinea was not included in Amnesty International's report for
 1983. Freedom House, in its 1983 report, described Papua New
 Guinea as "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Papua New Guinea has land and mineral resources, but modern
 technology has only recently arrived and is not yet widely
 disseminated. Most of the population lives at the subsistence
 level. Lack of infrastructure--roads, ports, and electric
 power--is a constraint on growth. Another barrier to growth is
 communal ownership of land, which discourages individual investment
 and inhibits the government's exercise of eminent domain.
 Nonetheless, according to available economic indicators, the
 standard of living in Papua New Guinea is gradually improving. Per
 capita Gross National Product is up from $360 in 1970 to $817 in
 1981, an average annual gain of two percent in real terms. In 1983
 the population grew at the rate of 2.8 percent to 3.259,000.

 Infant mortality is declining (95 per 1,000 live births in 1983).
 Caloric intake is rising. Life expectancy at birth in 1980 was
 50.6 years. School enrollment is up from 39 percent of primary
 school-aged children in 1970 to 64 percent in 1980. The Government
 provides education and health care on a nondiscriminatory basis;
 however, the highlands region lags in education because of its
 later exposure to the outside world.
 Papua New Guinea devotes significant resources to confronting the
 serious social problems of tribal feuds in the rural highlands
 region and crime in the towns. During 1980-82, tribal fighting
 caused about 140 deaths a year, plus injuries and extensive
 destruction of homes and gardens. Enforcement of existing laws is
 not wholly effective. Participants usually do not testify against
 each other in court and, of 1,492 persons arrested for such
 offenses in early 1983, only 99 were convicted. Parliament
 stiffened penalties for tribal fighting in May 1983, but it is
 still too early to assess the results. A constitutional amendment
 has been introduced in Parliament to allow a presumption of guilt
 in the case of an individual picked up in a fighting zone, but it
 has not been debated and its future is uncertain.
 Urban crime has its main roots in high unemployment among recent
 migrants from the countryside and a traditional acceptance of
 intergroup violence. The number of crimes reported nationwide in
 1982 rose 27 percent over 1981. The Deputy Prime Minister has
 stated that the 1982 crime rate in Papua New Guinea of 751 per
 100,000 is about double the average for developing countries, while
 the resultant prison population of 151 per 100,000 is one of the
 highest in Asia and the South Pacific.
 Women have equal rights before the law and their status is
 gradually improving, but they still face difficulties.
 Wife-beating is said to be widespread, but it is rarely brought to
 the attention of the authorities. In urban areas, along with other
 violent crimes, rape is a problem of increasing severity.  In the
 villages, women are protected by their kin, but attacks on women
 are a common feature of intertribal conflict. Against the
 background of traditional male dominance, the achievements of women
 in Papua New Guinea are significant. Some have achieved prominence
 as doctors, lawyers, and office directors. The Permanent Secretary
 for Labor and the head of the Education Commission are women. One
 woman is a member of the National Parliament and several hold seats
 in provincial assemblies.
