SAUDI ARABIA
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
Saudi Arabia’s human rights record remained poor and there were no discernible
improvements in 2001. The government took no steps to ease restrictions
in the key areas of freedom of association and expression,women’s rights, and religious
freedom, or move toward a more open and tolerant society. The continued
absence of institutions independent of the government, such as political parties
and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), allowed the ruling royal family to
maintain its historic franchise on power, beyond public reproach and accountability.
A May 24 royal decree increased the members of the all-male Consultative
Council from ninety to 120, although the appointed body remained toothless with
respect to any substantive oversight of the executive branch of government.Workers,
including millions of foreigners, were not permitted to form trade unions,
strike, or engage in collective bargaining, and household servants—numbering an
estimated one million foreigners—continued to be excluded from protection
under the labor law.The kingdom also remained off-limits to international human rights organizations, and no one inside the country dared to break the long-standing
taboo on openly scrutinizing and reporting human rights abuses.
On October 1, the Council of Ministers approved a 225-article penal code,
scheduled to come into force ninety days after its publication in the official gazette.
The government said that the code prohibited “coercion, or infliction of physical or
moral harm on those arrested,” granted criminal suspects “the right to receive legal
assistance from a lawyer,” and prohibited “detention or imprisonment except in
jails or special secure units, and then only on the issuance of a court order.”The law
also set a five-day limit on detention by criminal investigators, specifying that
detainees “shall be released if there is no justification or if there is not enough evidence,”
although in cases of “serious crimes” the interior minister also had the right
to detain suspects.The council also approved on October 1 a forty-three-article law
regulating the legal profession.
The practical effect of these new laws, once in force, remained to be seen. Cases
during the year involving detained foreign nationals continued to illustrate fundamental
flaws in the Saudi judicial system that facilitate human rights violations,
including prolonged incommunicado detention, inadequate safeguards against
torture and ill treatment of prisoners during interrogation, denial of access to
lawyers, and the lack of transparency of legal proceedings. Several foreign governments
complained that Saudi authorities had not provided timely notification of
the arrest of their nationals and in some cases had denied consular officials access
to detainees for long periods.Twice during the year authorities used televised “confessions”
to brand suspects guilty of violent activities before they were charged or
tried, a practice at odds with the government’s affirmation in 2000 that “in the
Islamic shariah, presumption of innocence is the fundamental principle in criminal
proceedings.”
One person was killed and others injured in a series of bombing attacks in
Riyadh and Khobar between November 2000 and March 2001, which the authorities
said were a consequence of turf wars among expatriates involved in the illegal
but highly lucrative alcohol trade. (See below.) Two other attacks followed in Khobar:
on May 2, a U.S. citizen was seriously injured, and on October 6, a U.S. citizen
and another victim who was not identified were killed and four foreigners
wounded. Authorities announced on November 14 that the second person killed
was a Palestinian dentist who worked in Riyadh,whom they alleged was the perpetrator
of the bombing.
Three foreign residents of Saudi Arabia—Alexander Mitchell, British;William
Sampson,Canadian; and Raaf Schifer, Belgian—appeared on Saudi state television
on February 4,“confessing” to two separate car bombings in Riyadh that killed one
Briton and injured others in November 2000. The videotaped statements were
made after the detainees had been held incommunicado for over a month without
their respective consulates being informed and were aired before completion of the
criminal investigation or formal charging.According to the Canadian government,
the Saudi interior minister confirmed on February 13 that Sampson had not been
permitted to consult with a lawyer during the investigation stage of the proceedings.
By November, the three men continued to be held in solitary confinement and
a trial was several months away, according to one of their lawyers.
The videotaped “confessions” of three British citizens, who admitted involvement
in three bombings between December 2000 and March 2001,were shown on
Saudi television on August 13. James Lee, James Cottle, and Les Walker said they
had “received orders” to carry out attacks in Riyadh on January 10 and March 15,
and in Khobar on December 15. The Khobar bombing injured one person; the
March explosion injured two. As was the case during the February “confessions,”
the suspects did not disclose any motives for their actions, nor who had ordered the
violence. The British government said it was informed by Saudi authorities about
the “confessions” the day before the broadcast but was not told of the charges or a
trial date.These men were also held in solitary confinement, and as of early November
a trial was not expected for several months.
Two accused Chechen airplane hijackers, one of them a minor, were reportedly
brought to trial in September but denied legal representation. On September 5,
Okaz newspaper quoted Judge Sheikh Saleh bin Muhamed al-Luhaidan, chairman
of the Supreme Judicial Council and a member of the Senior Council of Ulema
(religious scholars), as saying: “A case such as this requires no defense lawyer
because the hijacking occurred and the hijackers are known and have confessed
their crimes.” The same day the Russian Foreign Ministry said that it had not
received “official confirmation”of the trial nor a response from Saudi authorities to
its request for the extradition of the two Chechens, named as Deni Magomerzayev,
nineteen, and Eriskhan Arsayev, sixteen. The teenagers were apprehended following
the abortive hijacking of a Russian passenger plane flying from Moscow to
Istanbul on March 16. The aircraft was forced to land in Medina; three people were
killed, including the third alleged hijacker, when Saudi forces stormed the plane to
release the passengers and crew.
Trials continued to be conducted behind closed doors. A Riyadh court on May
26 sentenced four British citizens to flogging and prison terms for illegal alcohol
trading, but British authorities said they were not notified until May 31. The court
sentenced Kelvin Hawkins to two and a half years of imprisonment and five hundred
lashes,while Paul Moss, David Mornin, and Ken Hartley received lesser terms
and punishment of three hundred to five hundred lashes each.
Relations between the government and the minority Ismaili Shiite community
remained tense in the wake of violent clashes with security forces that erupted in
Najran province in April 2000 and resulted in scores of arrests. In April 2001,
twelve Ismailis signed a petition to Crown Prince Abdullah, complaining about
official discrimination, unfair trials, and prolonged imprisonment, and an Ismaili
delegation delivered the petition and other documents to the palace in Jeddah on
April 29. The next day, a security official arrived in a special bus, which the delegation
understood to mean that the governor wished to see them. Instead, at least
six members of the delegation were taken to security headquarters in Jeddah and
imprisoned there; as of this writing, in November, it was unclear whether they
were still being held.
Death sentences by beheading were carried out throughout the year, mostly for
murder, rape, or drug-trafficking. By mid-November, at least seventy-five Saudis
and foreigners had been executed, according to Reuters. Foreign governments
rarely raised fair-trial concerns publicly when their nationals were sentenced to execution. However, a sharp rise in the number of Indians beheaded on drugrelated
offenses (from one in 1998 to twenty-four in 2000, according to the Indian
ambassador to Saudi Arabia) prompted some Indian officials to press for an Indian
government investigation of the duping of Indian migrant workers, mainly from
the state of Kerala, by drug dealers posing as job recruiters.
The government’s highly publicized ratification in 2000 of the Convention on
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women prompted no initiatives
to give Saudi women equal rights with men.Women were not permitted
identity cards in their own name, only “family cards” in the name of their husband
or father, did not enjoy freedom of movement, were not permitted to drive, and
lacked equal rights with men with respect to the nationality of their children,
among other discriminatory practices. On April 26, Prince Nayef stated that the
government would not lift the ban on women driving: “It is not possible, and there
are no studies on the subject at all.”
The Saudi public gained access to the Internet in 1999 and the number of users
reached an estimated 500,000 in 2001. The government continued to block what
official censors viewed as objectionable web sites, ranging from pornography to
politics. Ibrahim al-Fareeh, Internet supervisor at King Abdul Aziz Center for Science
and Technology (KACST), which controlled access to the Internet, told the
Associated Press in April that KACST was about to launch a new campaign, with
advanced equipment, to block a further 200,000 sites, raising to 400,000 the number
of sites off-limits to Saudi users
Some seven million foreigners worked in the kingdom, many of them from
India, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Bangladesh. Conditions
were particularly difficult for the estimated one million women who were
employed as domestic workers, a job category not covered by the labor law. Over
19,000 women domestics fled from their employers in 2000, a Labor Ministry official
acknowledged in April, citing mistreatment, nonpayment of wages, and other
grievances. The Philippines ambassador told his government that many Filipino
workers in Saudi Arabia were “subjected to poor living conditions, salary underpayment,
insufficient food, inhuman working conditions, and long hours of work
without rest or day off,” Business World (Manila) reported on March 2. He said
Saudi employers illegally “sold” Filipino workers to new sponsors for 2,000 riyals
(U.S. $533) when employment contracts expired or the workers were no longer
needed, although Saudi authorities had banned such transfers of sponsorship.
Some 370,000 Indonesians were employed in the kingdom, most of them
reportedly women domestic workers. In July, the Indonesian government temporarily
suspended sending workers to Saudi Arabia pending a formal memorandum
of understanding (MoU) under which Saudi authorities agreed to afford
greater legal protection to Indonesian migrant workers.Under the MoU, signed in
September, the Saudi embassy in Jakarta was to provide the Indonesian Labor Ministry
“a weekly list of laborers granted visas and the names of Indonesian recruitment
offices handling the process.”Also, all visa applications were to be processed
through certified labor recruitment offices in both countries, and efforts made to
prevent labor recruiters “from manipulating costs, official papers, medical reports
and sending unqualified manpower.”
The uncertain future of the remaining 5,200 Iraqi refugees in the Rafha desert
camp near the Saudi-Iraq border received publicity when dozens of refugees began
a hunger strike on June 23 to press demands for resettlement in third countries.
Those at Rafha were the last of some 33,000 Iraqi refugees who had been held at the
camp since the end of the Gulf war in 1991, of whom 25,000 were resettled in
Europe, North America, and Australia, while some 3,000 voluntarily returned to
Iraq. The suspension of resettlement programs for these refugees in 1997 left those
who remained at the camp no option other than repatriation to Iraq,but the majority
of them did not want to return there, according to the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The government reportedly more than
tripled the grant it provided to returnees to 10,000 riyals (U.S. $2,666), but apparently
without effect. In July, the government said the Iraqi refugees were “treated
well,” and denied “allegations of rioting, detention of refugees, or incidents of beating,
insults or torture.” It added that although the Defense Ministry supervised the
camp, it was “UNHCR, not the Kingdom, that [was] in charge of resettlement
demands by the remaining 5,000 refugees.”
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Saudi Arabia remained one of the region’s embarrassing wastelands with respect
to an openly functioning network of independent human rights lawyers, other
activists, and institutions.As a result, victims of abuse and their supporters were left
isolated and vulnerable, and the timely documentation of rights violations was
exceedingly difficult. International human rights organizations were not granted
access during the year, and foreign journalists based in the country rarely investigated
and reported allegations of abuse.
In March, a seven-member delegation from the U.S. Commission on International
Religious Freedom (see below) visited Saudi Arabia and interviewed senior
government officials who, it reported,“expressed a desire to continue dialogue with
the U.S. government on religious freedom issues.”
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
In January, the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child examined the kingdom’s
initial report on compliance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
In its concluding observations, the committee criticized the Saudi authorities’“narrow
interpretations of Islamic texts,” asserting that this “imped[ed] the enjoyment
of many human rights protected under the convention.” It cited in particular provisions
of domestic law that discriminated against females and non-Muslims, and
allowed flogging as a judicial punishment.
The committee found “direct and indirect discrimination against girls and children
born out of wedlock, including in areas relating to civil status (e.g. lack of identity cards for females) and personal status (e.g. inheritance, custody, and
guardianship),” and expressed concern that the nationality law did not “grant equal
citizenship status to children of Saudi women married to non-nationals.”The committee
noted that the age of majority was not defined under Saudi law and commented
that as a result the death penalty could be imposed for offenses committed
when suspects were under eighteen years old, a violation of the convention. It further
commented that persons under eighteen “may be sentenced to a variety of
methods of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment such as flogging,
stoning and amputation, which are systematically imposed by judicial
authorities.”The committee urged the government to “end the imposition”of such
practices on “persons who may have committed crimes while under eighteen.”
The U.N. special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers was
scheduled to conduct a fact-finding visit to the kingdom from October 11-19, pursuant
to an invitation that the government extended in 2000. The visit was postponed
because of security concerns; as of November 5 it had not been rescheduled.
In 1997, Saudi Arabia became a state party to the Convention against Torture
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The kingdom’s
initial report to the U.N.Committee against Torture, submitted in February,
was scheduled to be examined by the committee at its November 12-23 session in
Geneva but the government asked for a postponement shortly before the session.
United States
Ties between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia were cemented by long-standing mutual
military and economic interests. The U.S. remained the world’s leading supplier of
defense equipment and services to the kingdom, with military exports in 2000
totaling almost U.S. $2 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The department also reported that Saudi Arabia was the twenty-fourth-largest
export market for U.S. companies, with merchandise exports of $6.2 billion in
2000, and that U.S. investment in the kingdom climbed to $4.8 billion in the same
year. Saudi exports to the U.S. were $14.2 billion in 2000 as oil prices increased.
Five U.S.-based multinationals were among the eight international energy
companies selected in May for three major natural gas exploration and development
projects and related water, power, and petrochemical facilities, with initial
foreign investment estimated at $20 billion. ExxonMobil, the kingdom’s leading
foreign investor, was chosen to lead two of the ventures: the largest in South
Ghawar,with Royal Dutch/Shell,BP, and Phillips Petroleum, and the Red Sea project,
with the participation of Enron and Occidental. Participants in the third project,
in the Rub al-Khali near Shaybah, were Royal Dutch/Shell, TotalFina Elf, and
Conoco. The government signed preparatory agreements with the companies on
June 3, with the Houston-based Marathon Oil Company replacing Enron, which
withdrew on June 1.
In addition to the State Department’s annual country report, which once again
bluntly described the broad pattern of rights abuses in Saudi Arabia, other reports
contributed additional information and analysis. For example, the U.S. Commission
on International Religious Freedom recommended to the State Department on August 16 the designation of Saudi Arabia as one of nine “countries of particular
concern.” In its accompanying report, the commission charged that Saudi Arabia
“suppresses religious views of both Saudi and non-Saudi Muslims that do not
conform to official positions,” including the minority Shiite and Ismaili communities.
The commission dismissed the government’s claim that non-Muslims were
permitted private worship. It said that the definition of the term was “vague,” and
that individuals engaged in such activity have been “arrested,imprisoned,deported
and harassed by the authorities.” The commission noted that “diplomatic personnel
from Western countries face difficulties in their religious practice” and that the
problems were “compounded for foreign guest workers who have no diplomatic
standing and little or no access to private religious services conducted at diplomatic
facilities.” The State Department’s 2001 international religious freedom report,
published on October 26, found that freedom of religion “does not exist” in Saudi
Arabia, but, as in 2000, the kingdom was not designated one of the countries of particular
concern.
The State Department’s Trafficking in Persons Report, published in July, identified
Saudi Arabia as one of the world’s destination countries for trafficked persons,
and noted that workers from India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand,
Bangladesh, and the Horn of Africa “have reported being forced into domestic
servitude and sexual exploitation.” The report said that the Saudi government did
not acknowledge trafficking as a problem and authorities had not crafted legislation
or undertaken other “significant efforts” to combat it.
In its annual patterns of global terrorism report, released in April, the State
Department raised concerns that Saudi authorities were not enforcing consistently
their requirement that NGOs and private voluntary agencies obtain government
authorization “before soliciting contributions for domestic or international
causes,” and over allegations that “some international terrorist organization representatives
solicited and collected funds from private citizens in Saudi Arabia.”
Prior to the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington, there were clear
strains in the U.S.-Saudi relationship over the Saudi government’s dissatisfaction
with what it considered the pro-Israel stance of the Bush administration. A White
House invitation to Crown Prince Abdullah to visit Washington in 2001 was
rejected twice, in May and in July. The Saudi government also postponed indefinitely
the Washington annual meeting of the joint Saudi-U.S. military committee,
scheduled for August.
Another source of bilateral tension was the June 21 U.S. federal grand jury
indictment of thirteen Saudis and one unnamed Lebanese for planning and carrying
out the June 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers military housing complex in
Dhahran, which killed nineteen U.S. servicemen and injured another 372 Americans.
The defendants included Hani al-Sayegh, who was arrested in Canada in
March 1997, transferred to the U.S. in June 1997 on a pledge that he would cooperate
with U.S. investigators, and then deported to Saudi Arabia in October 1999 after
he allegedly reneged on his promise and was denied political asylum in the U.S.The
indictment named the Saudi defendants as members of the Saudi Hizballah organization
and identified most of them as Shi’a Muslims from Qatif. On June 21, U.S.
Attorney General John Ashcroft said the suspects had received support from unnamed Iranian officials. The indictment, he said, “explains that elements of the
Iranian government inspired, supported, and supervised members of the Saudi
Hizballah . . . .[T]he charged defendants reported their surveillance activities to
Iranian officials and were supported and directed in those activities by Iranian officials.”
Despite these serious allegations, no Iranian was named as a defendant in the
indictment.
The indictment apparently caught the Saudi government by surprise and senior
officials expressed irritation. Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdel Aziz confirmed
that eleven of the suspects were imprisoned in Saudi Arabia and would be
tried in a Saudi court, but in an interview with the daily al-Riyadh, published on
June 23, he said: “The Americans never informed us or coordinated with us on this
issue.” He also disputed the existence of the Saudi Hizballah group mentioned in
the indictment, saying there was no such group, although some individuals might
be “linked to the Lebanese Hizbollah.” Prince Nayef said on June 30 that the suspects
in Saudi custody would never be sent to the U.S. for trial, adding: “We have
nothing whatsoever to do with the U.S. court, and we are not concerned with what
has been said or what is going to be decided by the U.S.”
Following the September 11 attacks on the U.S., Saudi officials announced “full
support” for international anti-terrorist initiatives, and pledged to keep stable oil
prices and supplies.But there were signs of further strain in U.S.-Saudi relations. In
September, the government withdrew its diplomatic recognition of Afghanistan’s
Taliban government for “defaming Islam by harboring and supporting terrorists,”
but senior officials said they would not permit the U.S. to use its military facilities
in Saudi Arabia to carry out offensive operations against Arab or Muslim states.
U.S.Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld visited the kingdom on October 4 and
met King Fahd,Crown Prince Abdullah, and Minister of Defense Prince Sultan but
he said nothing publicly about the Bush administration’s specific requests for Saudi
government assistance in its global anti-terror campaign.After meeting Rumsfeld,
Prince Sultan suggested that the U.S. had made no requests, and said that the question
of Saudi support “was not a point of discussion.” Rumsfeld, however, stated
that “there are any number of countries that are doing things that are public, there
are any number of countries that are doing things that are exactly the same privately,”
and said the U.S. appreciated the “public support” of Saudi Arabia and “the
things they are doing to assist us.”
But tensions were evident, particularly following the FBI’s September 27 press
release that described seven of the nineteen men suspected of the September 11
hijackings as “possible” Saudi nationals. In addition, the FBI list of twenty-two
“Most Wanted Terrorists,” issued on October 10, included Osama bin Laden, who
was stripped of his Saudi citizenship in 1994, and four other Saudi nationals implicated
in the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing.
By mid-October, Saudi officials began to voice complaints publicly. Prince
Nayef, quoted on October 15, said that the U.S. had provided no “material evidence”
that Saudi nationals were among the hijackers. He similarly criticized allegations
about private Saudi financing of terrorist groups and U.S. requests to freeze
assets, saying it was “unacceptable to take any action without providing the evidence
that there are some [suspicious] accounts in the kingdom.”He added that the government had previously “requested the United States, Britain and some European
countries to cooperate with us in this field, but found no [positive] response.”
The New York Times reported on October 25 that unnamed U.S. federal authorities
were “now sure”that fifteen of the nineteen hijackers were Saudi citizens, based
on “weeks of investigation” in the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, and that Saudi authorities
“assisted” the U.S. in confirming their identities. On October 31, the Washington
Post reported that eleven of the alleged Saudi hijackers had been issued U.S. visas in
Jeddah and four others received visas in Riyadh, citing U.S. State Department documents
made available to the newspaper.
