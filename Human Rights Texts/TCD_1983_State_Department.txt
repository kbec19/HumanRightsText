 CHAD
 
 Chad is ruled by an authoritarian regime in N'Djamena
 dominated by the personal authority of President Hissein
 Habre. This strong presidency at the head of a French-style
 Council of Ministers is complemented by an appointed National
 Consultative Council. Both councils are composed of indivi-
 duals representing various ethnic, political, and regional
 groups. However, the regime draws its principal authority
 from the Command Council of the Armed Forces of the North,
 the political base on which President Habre took power in
 1982. Prior to Babre's victory in 1982, Chad had been in a
 state of civil war for years with as many as 11 different
 armies contending for control of the country. During the
 prolonged civil war institutions that might be expected
 to provide for the protection of human rights, such as the
 judiciary, largely disintegrated.
 While the Government initially succeeded in its aim to
 assert its control throughout Chad, with the exception of
 the Aozou Strip held by the Libyans since 1973, by mid-summer
 1983 Libyan and Libyan-backed rebel forces had conquered and
 occupied the northern third of the country. This led to the
 introduction of French and Zairian forces at the request of
 the Government as well as a program of United States military
 assistance. Despite the nominal role of the "Transitional
 Government of National Unity" under Goukouni Oueddei, the
 Libyan intervention led to its control of a substantial area
 of Chad. Libyan-instigated rebel infiltrations continue
 into the rest of Chad. This report addresses human rights
 concerns in both the occupied and unoccupied areas of Chad.
 In the broadest terms 1983 was a complex year for human
 rights in Chad. During the first half of the year, the
 Government continued its efforts to reconstruct governmental
 institutions and to encourage various elements, e.g. southern
 technocrats, to cooperate in this task. New courts were
 established and President Habre marked his initial anniversary
 in power with an amnesty for prisoners being held for
 offenses against state security. However, the Government
 increasingly focused on security to the detriment of human
 rights considerations with the advent of rebel attacks
 and Libyan intervention.
 Primarily in southern Chad, where support for the Government
 is largely passive, military exactions and local incidents,
 including robbery, rape, and the razing of homes, led to a
 cycle of repression and reaction. The Government relied
 increasingly on its internal security apparatus comprising
 the armed forces, the national police, and the national
 intelligence service. The security services are generally
 held in some fear by Chadians. With the advent of the
 fighting in the north, the Government's best troops and
 leaders in the south were withdrawn, leaving behind primarily
 inexperienced northern troops to ensure the security of the
 south. These troops reacted harshly to persons suspected of
 sympathizing with the rebels and resorted to human rights
 violations extending to torture and summary execution
 on occasion. The situation was exacerbated by traditional
 north-south tension reaching back to slave-trading days and
 by the relatively recent shift from southern to northern
 political dominance.

 Information is more difficult to obtain regarding the
 territory controlled by Libya, which is almost completely
 closed. Nevertheless, there are reports of gross violations
 of human rights by the Libyans and Chadian rebels; a mass
 grave of executed prisoners was discovered near Abeche
 after government forces liberated the city from the rebels.
 There also are reports from displaced persons and captured
 rebels of heavy repression of the Chadian population and the
 existence of severe hunger.
 Chad, an extremely poor country, has significant economic
 activity only in cotton and livestock production, and
 remains dependent on France for financial assistance and on
 various international donors for humanitarian and development
 aid. With about 87 percent of the population semi-nomadic
 or engaged in subsistence agriculture, the monetized economy
 essentially involves only those people living in the four
 cities of the country. Between drought and Libyan controls
 on the local population, almost all Lndigeneous economic
 activity in the north, which primarily consisted of nomadic
 herding, is believed to have halted.
 RESPECT FOR BUNAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Increased insurgency and Libya's intervention in Chad
 markedly raised the level of violence in Chad in the last
 six months of 1983. With the resumption of large-scale
 fighting in the north, shaky government control over its
 scattered forces in both the north and south undoubtedly led
 to human rights abuses including instances of summary
 execution and torture by government forces. Several reputable
 sources suggest that at least six prominent persons
 thought to be sympathetic to southern rebels were summarily
 executed by government troops. Amnesty International
 stated on October 10 that more than 160 civilians in the
 south had been killed by government troops in the preceeding
 15 months, often far from battle zones, and In apparent
 reprisal for attacks by antigovernment forces. Although
 information on the killings by antigovernment forces is
 difficult to obtain, it is believed such instances have been
 widespread. In August, the Government took Journalists to
 view a mass grave near Abeche containing the bodies of about
 a dozen prisoners it stated had been executed by rebel
 forces. Amnesty International also has received unconfirmed
 reports that rebel elements summarily executed an unspecified
 number of government officials and members of the security
 forces.
 b. Disappearance
 An unknown number of persons have disappeared as a direct
 result of Libya's occupation of nearly half of Chad, of
 insurgency fomented by Libyan-supported rebel forces, and of
 
 
 84
 government countermeasures. Prisoners taken by government
 forces have indicated that a substantial number of Chadians
 in the occupied territory who refused to collaborate with
 the Libyans have disappeared. Reports of similar activities
 on the part of insurgents in southern Chad also have been
 received. Other reports indicate that an unspecified number
 of persons detained by the Government for suspected sympathy
 with rebels forces are unaccounted for. Amnesty International
 reported that there is some evidence to suggest that certain
 persons detained by the Government have disappeared. The
 number of such cases is not known.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 As under other categories of this section, the relative
 improvement of the human rights situation during early 1983
 was abrubtly affected in mid-year by the armed Libyan/rebel
 intervention in the north and the spread of dissidence and
 repression in southern Chad. Torture and cruel treatment
 are believe to have been perpetrated by all sides. It has
 been widely alleged by private individuals in Chad that the
 bodies of some persons who had been in government custody
 and later were found dead--perhaps less than a dozn--indicated
 they had been tortured by unknown individuals. Amnesty
 International specifically identified one victim as Yacoub
 B. Langue, the former Police Commissioner of Lai. Frendh
 journalists reported in late summer from southern Chad, that
 government forces there had been guilty of cruel and degrading
 treatment, e.g. the razing of villages and rapes, and lesser
 humiliations of persons thought to be sympathetic to rebels
 operating in the region. In late summer, the Government
 tightened discipline among its forces in the south and
 replaced military and civilian leaders considered responsible
 for the exactions and repressions contributing to southern
 ill-will. Some government soldiers directly responsible for
 crimes against civilians have been tried by military tribunals.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, and Exile
 People have been detained without warrants and incarcerated
 or otherwise punished by both government and antigovernment
 forces for expressing sentiments deemed hostile. Persons
 detained for this reason have not been formally charged with
 treason or espionage nor brought before an independent
 judiciary. The Government had made progress toward curbing
 such arrests prior to Libya's invasion and the resurgence of
 rebel activity. Shortly before the first anniversary of
 Habre's takeover of power, government forces temporarily
 held a large number of people to prevent possible antigovern-
 ment demonstrations. These persons, and about 500 prisoners-
 of-war, as well as other persons detained for offenses
 committed within the previous year were released as part of
 the Government's amnesty decreed on June 7. Currently,
 it is estimated that a total of about 2,500 prisoners-of-war
 are being held by both sides. There is information indicating
 that the prisoners being held by Libyan forces are deprived
 of sufficient food, water, and medicine.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The country's judicial system continues to suffer from
 extensive losses of material and personnel during the last
 three years. In N'Djamena the Ministry of Justice's buildings
 were seriously damaged by gunfire and looters, and the
 Ministry's library no longer exists for practical purposes.
 Many legal procedures called for by the penal code are not
 fully implemented, such as the right to a judicial determination
 of the legality of detention and access to a lawyer. The
 Fundamental Act of the Republic states that the judiciary is
 dependent on the executive. This limits the magistrates
 from exercising fully independent judgments. According to
 available information the Libyans and Chadian rebels practice
 summary justice exclusively in the portion of Chad they
 occupy.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In the recent past, human rights violations in Chad have
 stemmed less from pervasive control by the central government
 than from lack of government authority. The current and
 preceding governments in N'Djamena have frequently failed to
 follow legal procedures which call for a warrant and
 daytime visits for entry into the homes of persons suspected
 of crimes. In southern Chad, undisciplined government
 forces have taken advantage of the increased civil strife in
 the latter half of 1983 to loot and illegally occupy private
 homes and buildings. The Government has sought to redress
 this situation by replacing various military and civilian
 leaders. Information on this subject is not available for
 the areas controlled by the Libyan and Chadian rebels.
 Section 2   Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Chadian people under government control have considerable
 scope for and access to free expression. Ideologically
 unfriendly foreign magazines and papers are on sale, and the
 government-owned media (the radio, one newsheet, and a
 magazine) often show independence. However, individual
 Chadians are prudent about publicly expressing views directly
 contrary to government interests. Religious groups generally
 publish and distribute their material freely; however, one
 review by a Christian youth organization reportedly was
 suspended. At intervals during the height of combat with
 Libyan and rebel forces, the Government applied sporadic
 censorship on dispatches from foreign journalists in N'Djamena.
 However, the Government has no organized mechanism for
 censorship. In the Libyan/rebel-controlled areas there
 is claimed to be only one radio station, Radio Bardai; it is
 actually located in Libya. It broadcasts highly vituperative
 propaganda. It is believed that no freedom of speech or
 press is permitted in these areas.
 
 
 86
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Throughout Chad people are not free to peacefully assemble
 for political purposes. In government-controlled areas,
 however, Chadians continue to enjoy the right of peaceful
 assembly and association if their objective is non-political.
 Two struggling labor unions and members of professional
 groups can gather without fear of repression. Individuals
 who wish to protest government policies or actions can
 do so only within district or village popular committees
 established by the Government.
 c. Freedom of Religiorr
 Chad is divided into a Muslim north and a Christian or
 Animist south, but these distinctions appear to have little
 impact on the practice of religion. President Habre has
 repeatedly stressed that the Government remains secular in
 the face of Libyan pressure that Chad become an Islamic
 state. There is freedom of worship for the many faiths and
 denominations in Chad. The Unification Church, however, was
 denied permission in 1983 to establish a church, according
 to one report. While it is generally considered that Islam
 has increased its presence more successfully than other
 religions over recent years, the practice of other faiths is
 no bar to advancement except perhaps in being a cultural
 anomaly among northern Chadians. It is believed that the
 proselytizing zeal of the Libyans severely circumscribes
 religious freedom in the occupied zone, despite the presence
 of a number of non-Islamic southern rebels.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 The previously largely unfettered movement of persons
 throughout Chad has been increasingly circumscribed since
 the Libyan/rebel attacks and occupation of northern Chad
 and by rebel activity in the south. There is no freedom of
 movement into or from the occupied zone, and even within the
 occupied city of Pays Largeau, Chadians must have passes to
 go from one neighborhood to another. In southern Chad
 travel has for some time been impeded by government security
 roadblocks and extortions by some government troops, as well
 as by roadblocks set up by freebooters. To this has
 increasingly been added the danger from rebel bands. In
 spite of theue hazards many people continue to move throughout
 sub-Saharan Chad and in and out of the country. There are
 no restrictions in principle on foreign travel (with
 the exception of the Libyan border), nor on residence in
 various parts of the country for those Chadians in government-
 controlled areas. Chadians are required to have a laissez-
 passer or passport to cross national boundaries. President
 Habre has publicly appealed for Chadians who have exiled
 themselves abroad or who joined the opposition to return to
 Chad, offering guarantees for their safety.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Chad is ruled by an authoritarian regime in N'Djamena
 
 
 87
 dominated by the personal authority of President Hissein
 Habre. This strong presidency at the head of a French-style
 Council of Ministers is complemented by an appointed National
 Consultative Council. Both councils are composed of indivi-
 duals representing various ethnic, political and regional
 groups. However, the regime draws its principal authority
 from the Command Council of the Armed Forces of the North,
 the political base on which President Sabre took power in
 1982. Chad was governed by southerners, especially Saras,
 in the years following independence. In the present govern-
 ment northern elements are strongest, but other regions of
 the country are not excluded from politics to the extent
 that the north was earlier.
 Chad is governed under the Fundamental Act, a quasi-constitution,
 and the Government has stated that further progress toward
 full democracy must await the ending of the current situation of
 external aggression. In addition, the Government has sought
 to enlarge the role of the National Consultative Council and
 to establish popular committees of the Command Council of
 the Armed Forces of the North--the nearest thing to a
 political party existing in the country. In appointments to
 high office President Sabre has sought to balance regional,
 ethnic, and other particularistic considerations. Chadians
 residing in the zone occupied by the Libyans have no ability
 to change their government, nor any role in its functioning.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government "rejected* an October 10 news release
 by Amnesty International charging human rights violations,
 including charges of extra-Judicial executions carried out
 by government forces on civilians and unarmed former soldiers.
 The Government claimed the report was based on "lies" spread
 by the Government's enemies. It did, however, invite
 Amnesty International to Chad to conduct an on-the-spot
 investigation under unspecified conditions. The status of
 this invitation is not known. Since August 1983, there have
 been government restrictions on the operations of the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) following
 disagreement over the ICRC's activities in northern Chad.
 The Government has expressed its willingness to resolve
 this disagreement and discussions are continuing on the
 subject. The organization continues to operate in the
 Libyan/rebel-controlled zone. The League of Red Cross
 Societies and the national Red Cross unit engage in activities
 involving the provision of food and medicine to persons held
 by the Government. Freedom House rates Chad "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Chad has been ravaged by civil strife for much of the last
 18 years. This continuing conflict, coupled with frequent
 drought and increasing desertification has reduced the
 national output to a level lower than it was in 1978. The
 typical Chadian's life style is determined by the country's
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 7
 
 
 pre-industrial and pastoral economy, as evidenced by the
 annual average per capita income of $110 in 1980. Particularly
 in the area of small-scale commercial activities, economic
 recovery appears to have begun despite the absence of
 anything more than a rudimentary banking system. However,
 large-scale investors appear to be taking a wait-and-see
 policy in face of Libya's intervention. The restoration
 of political stability in Chad is , prerequisite to economic
 reconstruction and to an improvement of living standards.
 Social data, such as mortality and longevity rates, also
 show that Chad's population of 4.99 million (1983 estimate)
 ranks among the world's most underprivileged. Life expectancy
 at birth is 40.6 years, and about 21 of every 100 babies die
 in infancy (1983. statistics provided by Chad's Ministry of
 Public Health). Much of the population is kept alive by
 emergency international food assistance. Such aid has been
 necessary because the typical Chadian satisfied only about
 72 percent of his caloric requirement in 1977, a year
 considered relatively good by current standards. Only 26
 percent of the population had access to safe drinking water
 in 1975, the last year for which reliable data are available.
 Only 20 percent of the population in functionally literate,
 and in 1975 only about 35 percent of the primary school-age
 population was actually enrolled in school. The reconstitu-
 tion of the educational system has been a high priority of
 the Governent. In November the University of Chad partially
 reopened, after being closed for five years.
 Although women are subordinate to men in Chadian society,
 girls do have the opportunity to attend schools where these
 are functioning. In addition, some women are in positions of
 responsibility in the Government, including the Secretary of
 State for Labor, Women's Affairs and Social Affairs. There
 are also women voluntarily serving in the armed forces.
 Although figures are not known, many women and their children
 have been left homeless and without adequate means of
 support, with their husbands either missing or dead due to
 the war.
