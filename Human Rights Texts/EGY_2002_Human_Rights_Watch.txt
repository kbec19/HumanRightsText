EGYPT
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
The human rights situation continued to deteriorate, marked by violations of
freedom of expression, association, and assembly; widespread arrests of government
opponents and prolonged detentions under state of emergency laws, in force
almost continuously since 1967; and grossly unfair trials before military and state
security courts.
Elections for the 454-member People’s Assembly, conducted in three stages
between October 18 and November 14, 2000, were the first to be held under full
judicial supervision, following legislative reforms prompted by a July 2000 ruling
of Egypt’s Supreme Constitutional Court. The ruling National Democratic Party
(NDP) won by a large majority but supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, who
could only run as independent candidates, secured seventeen seats and eleven other
opposition parties shared sixteen. Despite judicial supervision, clashes between
rival supporters and with the police left between nine and fifteen people dead, and
scores wounded. The authorities arrested hundreds of Muslim Brotherhoodaligned
and other opposition candidates and supporters in the run up to the elections
and prevented others fromreaching polling stations.
The authorities carried out further arrests of pro-Muslim Brotherhood candidates
and supporters in advance of the May-June elections to the Majlis al-Shura
(Consultative Council, the upper house of the parliament). These elections passed
off relatively peacefully, and were also won by the NDP.
The government-controlled Political Parties Committee of the Majlis al-Shura
licensed Egypt 2000, a new political party, in April, having previously rejected it in
1999 only for that decision to be overturned on April 7 by the Political Parties Tribunal.
Egypt 2000 was only the second political party to be licensed since the formation
of the Political Parties Committee in 1977, several other political groups
having been rejected, usually on grounds that their programs did not differ significantly
from those of existing registered political parties.
The Islamist opposition Labor Party, whose activities were frozen by the Political
Parties Committee in May 2000, remained suspended and its publications
banned. At least eleven Administrative Court rulings ordered the lifting of a ban
on the party’s bi-weekly newspaper, al-Sha‘ab, as a breach of constitutionally guaranteed
press freedoms. On March 20, the Administrative Court declared unlawful the government’s non-compliance with its rulings and its delaying tactic of lodging
appeals before courts that were clearly not competent to hear such cases.
Despite this, on March 21, the Political Parties Committee confirmed the ban on
al-Sha‘ab as the Labor Party’s status remained unresolved. In mid-July, a board of
advisers to the Supreme Administrative Court, which has previously upheld rulings
in favor of al-Sha‘ab, supported the committee’s position. The board argued
that earlier Administrative Court rulings were incorrect in stating that while the
committee was empowered to suspend political parties, it did not have the authority
to ban publications. In the interim, al-Sha‘ab continued to appear in an on-line
version.
Magdi Hussain, al-Sha‘ab’s imprisoned editor-in-chief, was released under a
presidential pardon on December 27, 2000, as were al-Sha‘ab journalist Salah
Bdeiwi and cartoonist ‘Issam Hanafi. All three were sentenced in August 1999 for
defaming Minister of Agriculture YusufWali. In March,Hussain was elected secretary-
general of the Labor Party, but in August, party leader Ibrahim Shukri suspended
him and ten others from the party’s executive committee and replaced him
as al-Sha‘ab’s editor-in-chief in an effort to purge the party of Islamists and so
obtain government approval to operate again.
The government continued to try civilian political suspects before military
courts and in mid-October announced that 253 Islamist detainees would be tried
before the Supreme Military Court.Of these, eighty-three had been arrested in May
and detained for membership of an illegal organization, illegally possessing
weapons, planning to overthrow the government by force, and forging official documents.
They included several foreign nationals; local press speculation linking
them to Osama Bin Laden’s al-Qaeda (The Base) network was later rejected by
President Husni Mubarak. The other 170 were suspected members of the banned
al-Gama’a al-Islamiyya (Islamic Group), many of whom, according to defense
lawyers, had already been held without trial for several years. All 170 reportedly
faced charges of carrying out acts of political violence between 1994 and 1998.
Local human rights groups condemned the decision to try more civilians in military
courts, from which there is no right of appeal. Since 1992, such courts have
convicted hundreds of Islamists, often after grossly unfair trials and torture during
pre-trial interrogation, and handed down scores of death sentences,many of which
have been carried out. On September 20, government security agents abducted
publisher Farid Zahran, a leader of the Egyptian People’s Committee for Solidarity
with the Palestinian Uprising (EPCSPU), to forestall a demonstration on September
28 called to mark the first anniversary of the outbreak of renewed conflict
between Palestinians and Israeli forces. Detained for two weeks, Zahran was
accused of disseminating tendentious information aimed at disturbing public
order and planning demonstrations, then released on bail on October 4.
Thousands of alleged members or supporters of banned Islamist groups contuinued
to be detained without trial, but a few were released, including Hamdi Abd
al-Rahman and Isma’il al-Bakl, both al-Gama‘a al-Islamiyya leaders. They were
released in July after serving fifteen-year prison terms for their part in the 1981
assassination of former president Anwar al-Sadat plus an additional five years when
they were held illegally.
Police routinely tortured or ill-treated detainees, and there were three deaths between January and July. In two earlier deaths in custody, criminal proceedings
against those accused of inflicting torture resulted in convictions. On February 7,
the Shibin al-Kom criminal court sentenced the director of Wadi Natroun maximum
security prison to ten years of imprisonment in connection with the death
under torture of Ahmad Muhammad ‘Issa, an awaiting trial prisoner, and sentenced
a major to seven years and four sergeants to five year terms, dismissing all
from their posts. In another case, a lieutenant at al-‘Agouza police station in Cairo
received a two-year prison term with labor on July 25 for beating detainee Ahmad
Imam ‘Abd al-Na‘im to death
Egyptian courts sentenced at least sixty-nine people to death between November
2000 and November 2001 for murder, rape, and other crimes, and carried out
eight executions.
The government continued to clamp down on Islamist political activists,
breaching their rights to freedom of expression and association. On November 19,
2000, a military court sentenced fifteen lawyers and other professionals linked to the
banned Muslim Brotherhood to prison terms of up to five years on charges including
membership of an illegal organization,but acquitted five other defendants. Earlier,
in October, the authorities detained hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood
supporters in Cairo, Alexandria, and elsewhere in advance of the parliamentary
elections, including some who were standing as independent candidates. Those
held included several members of the campaigning team of Jihan al-Halafawi, the
only woman candidate linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, and Labor Party members
running Magdi Hussain’s electoral campaign while he served his prison sentence.
This pattern was repeated in advance of the Majlis al-Shura elections. The
authorities detained at least 140 Muslim Brotherhood sympathisers starting in
mid-April 2001 in Asyut,Alexandria, al-Fayyum, and other centers, including some
who had just registered as candidates, such as Muhammad al-Sayyid Habib, an
Asyut University professor and former parliamentarian, and Abu Bakr Mitkis. All
were released without charge after the elections. Twenty-five other leading members
of the Muslim Brotherhood were arrested on July 15 in Imbaba for allegedly
holding an illegal meeting. They included Muhammad al-Shater, a former political
prisoner and reputedly a member of the Muslim Brotherhood’s highest decisionmaking
body, the Maktab al-Irshad (Guidance Bureau).
The government also prosecuted people on the basis of their alleged sexual orientation.
In July, the authorities referred fifty-two men to the Emergency State
Security Court for Misdemeanours, from which there is no right of appeal, on
charges of “obscene behaviour” under the Combat of Prostitution Law (Law 10 of
1961). Two defendants were also charged with expressing “contempt for religion”
under article 98(f) of the penal code,while a sixteen year old minor was sent before
the Juveniles Court.Most of the defendants had been arrested on May 11 in Cairo
and initially held incommunicado. During their trial, which began on July 18, the
court refused to investigate allegations by some defendants that they had been tortured
to make them confess and on November 14,twenty-one of them received sentences
of between one and two years of imprisonment on the “obscenity” charge.
The two charged with “contempt for religion” received three- and five-year terms.
The others were acquitted. The sixteen-year-old, who did have a right of appeal
from the Juveniles Court, was sentenced to three years of imprisonment for
“obscenity”on September 18.His appeal was due to be heard in November.
On December 6, 2001, the authorities released eighty-nine prisoners on humanitarian
grounds pending a verdict by the Sohag Criminal Court. They had been
among ninety-six Muslims and Coptic Christians tried in connection with communal
violence at al-Kusheh village in December 1999, in which twenty Copts and
one Muslim died. The Sohag Criminal Court had acquitted all the defendants
except for four Muslims,who were sentenced to terms ranging between one and ten
years for illegal possession of weapons, manslaughter, and damaging property, but
Coptic religious leaders and families of those killed criticized the verdict and the
General Prosecution quickly lodged an appeal. In July, the Court of Cassation
quashed the verdict and ordered a retrial of all the defendants, which then opened
in November.
In June, thousands of Copts demonstrated in Cairo over four days in protest at
the publication of sexually explicit photographs of a former Coptic monk by the
weekly newspaper al-Naba’ and its sister publication Akher Khabar, both of whose
publishing licenses the authorities withdrew on July 4. Several demonstrators were
injured in clashes with the police.The authorities charged Mamdouh Mahran, editor-
in-chief of al-Naba’, with undermining public order, defaming the Coptic
Church, publishing pornography, and other offences, and his trial opened on June
24 before the State Security Court for Misdemeanours. On September 16, he was
convicted on all but one count and sentenced to three years of imprisonment. President
Mubarak ratified the sentence on September 30, but Mahran suffered a heart
attack and was then hospitalized under guard. He appealed successfully to the
Administrative Court to overturn the Egypt Press Association’s decision to revoke
his membership, though a counter-appeal by the association to the Supreme
Administrative Court was still pending by November.
In January, Sherif al-Filali, an engineer, went on trial before the Emergency
Supreme State Security Court (ESSSC) charged effectively with espionage. Prosecutors
alleged that he was recruited into Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency by a
Russian army officer, Gregory Sergevic, who was tried in his absence in the same
case. During two months of pre-trial detention by the State Security Intelligence
(SSI) in Cairo, al-Filali was reportedly subjected to “psychological pressure” to confess.
However, while Sergevic was sentenced to life imprisonment al-Filali was
acquitted. The presiding judge ruled that Egyptian law provides for acquittal if a
defendant confesses before the start of a criminal investigation, as in al-Filali’s case,
even if the available evidence is sufficient to secure a conviction. On June 27, the
state security prosecutor announced that he would seek a re-trial, permissible
under emergency legislation. Verdicts of the ESSSC, which cannot be appealed,
must be ratified by the president. But in September, the president’s office refused to
endorse the verdict. The authorities then rearrested al-Filali and his new trial
opened on October 28. If convicted, he faced up to twenty-five years of imprisonment
with hard labor.
The government continued to target writers for exercising their freedom of
expression. In December 2000, the General Prosecution successfully appealed for the re-trial of Salahuddin Muhsin after the State Security Court for Misdemeanours
in Giza gave him a six-month suspended sentence in July 2000 for denigrating
Islam in his writings. In January 2001, he was retried before a different
circuit of the State Security Court, convicted and sentenced to three years’ imprisonment
with hard labor.He had no right of appeal.
The government also continued to ban books it deemed “offensive” to society,
either because their contents were held to be sexually explicit or because they were
considered defamatory to Islam. In May, al-Azhar’s Islamic Research Academy
banned two works, respectively by ‘Alaa’Hamed and Ibrahim Abu Khalil on the latter
ground.
Workers’ rights came under attack through arbitrary measures taken against
trade union activists who were outspoken around issues such as worker safety in the
state sector. Such measures, designed to prevent them from participating in union
elections, included transfer to other companies at short notice in the run-up to
elections, and being pressurized into withdrawing their candidacy. In the run-up to
the General Federation of Trade Unions elections, which began on October 8,
scores of workers who had been disqualified from running as candidates to shop
floor committees lodged appeals before the administrative courts contesting irregularities
in nomination procedures. The Center for Trade Union and Workers’ Services
(CTUWS), an Egyptian NGO that monitors and campaigns for workers’
rights, also came under pressure. Its director,Kamal Abbas, and Abdul Rashid Hilal,
board member and vice-chairman of the Iron and Steel Company trade union,
were both summoned before prosecution officials in Helwan in mid-September as
part of the government’s attempt to stifle criticism of working conditions and of
irregularities in trade union election procedures.
In February, the Egyptian Bar Association elected a new board and chairman,
ending five years of judicial sequestration imposed by the government in 1996 for
alleged financial irregularities by board members. There was wide speculation that
the government hoped the election, held under judicial supervision,would diminish
the Muslim Brotherhood’s influence over the association but the outcome once
again produced a Muslim Brotherhood-dominated board, with Nasserist lawyer
Sameh ‘Ashour elected as chairman.
In a landmark ruling on June 2, Egypt’s Supreme Constitutional Court declared
as unconstitutional article 48 of the penal code,which punished criminal complicity
to commit felonies or misdemeanours by two or more persons even if no crime
had actually been committed. The article, which provided for up to fifteen years of
imprisonment for felonies and up to three years of imprisonment for misdemeanours,
was widely used against Islamists charged with security offences, and
most recently invoked in the case the Saadeddin Ibrahim. (See below.) In late July,
Prosecutor General Maher Abdel Wahed decided not to exercise his right to refer
the ruling back to the court for re-examination, and ordered the release of all prisoners
convicted on the basis of article 48. In September, lawyers acting for scores of
Islamist prisoners lodged appeals with the State Security Court requesting their
release on these grounds, but by November it was unclear if any had been released.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
An amended version of the controversial Law on Civil Associations and Institutions
(Law 153 of 1999), which the Supreme Constitutional Court had overturned
in June 2000, was presented to the Majlis al-Shura in April but it had not been presented
to the People’s Assembly by November, and the earlier Law on Private Associations
and Institutions (Law 32 of 1964) remained in force. One positive
amendment would allow administrative courts to hear cases arising from disputes
between NGOs and the authorities, in lieu of courts of first instance, in line with the
Supreme Constitutional Court ruling, but other provisions that would allow the
government to control and interfere in the internal activities of NGOs, remained
unchanged.
On July 1, Cairo’s Administrative Court overturned the government’s decision
to refuse, for unspecified security reasons, to register the Egyptian Organization
for Human Rights (EOHR) as a recognized NGO. Following the overturning of
Law 153 of 1999, the EOHR had applied for registration under Law 32 of 1964 but
was informed by the Ministry of Social Affairs in July 2000 that a decision on its
application had been deferred upon a request from security officials. The EOHR
took the matter to the Administrative Court in February, and the July ruling stated
that since the ministry failed to process the EOHR’s application within the sixtyday
period specified by law, it was deemed accepted. The ruling was legally binding
on the ministry and its implementation could not be deferred even if appealed
before the Supreme Administrative Court, but by November the ministry had not
complied.
The government maintained its crackdown on human rights activists with the
trial and conviction of Saadeddin Ibrahim, director of the Ibn Khaldun Center for
Development Studies, and twenty-seven co-defendants. On May 21, the Supreme
State Security Court sentenced Ibrahim to seven years of imprisonment on charges
of receiving funding without authorization, disseminating false information damaging
to Egypt’s interests, and securing funds through fraud.He and four co-defendants
were acquitted on a fourth charge of conspiring to bribe public officials. The
court imposed one-year suspended sentences on twenty-one defendants, and sentenced
six others, including two who faced separate bribery charges, to between two
and five years of imprisonment with labor.
Ten of the accused remained at large, however, having been tried in their
absence. Most of the defendants were associated with two local NGOs, the Ibn
Khaldun Center and the Hoda Association, five as employees and the rest as shortterm
contract workers. Many had been arrested in mid-2000 in connection with
two projects funded by the European Union (E.U.) aimed at promoting voter education
and encouraging eligible voters to register and exercise their political rights.
The seven-month trial opened on November 18, 2000. In addition to serious
pre-trial irregularities, the proceedings failed to meet international standards for
fair trial.Verdicts of the Supreme State Security Court, an exceptional court based
on emergency legislation, could only be appealed by cassation or review, limiting
the grounds for appeal to points of law and precluding the facts of the case.Defense lawyers did not have full access to prosecution documents presented to the court
until four months into the trial. After sentencing, Saadeddin Ibrahim, Khaled al-
Fayyad, Usama Hammad, and Mohammad Hassanein were held in Tora Mazra‘at
prison, and Nadia Abdel Nour and Magda al-Bey at the women’s prison in Qanater.
The defendants who received suspended sentences were released within days. An
appeal hearing before the Court of Cassation was scheduled for December 19. The
outcome of the trial was condemned by Egyptian and international human rights
organizations, and both U.S. and E.U. officials voiced concern.
In June, the government shut down the offices of the Sudanese Human Rights
Organization (SHRO), which had been operating in exile in Egypt since 1991.
Although no official reason was given, the SHRO’s president believed that the closure
was the direct outcome of a report issued by the organization on the practice
of slavery in Sudan.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
In January, the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child considered Egypt’s
second periodic report on the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of
the Child. It welcomed improvements to infant and child mortality rates, but noted
that “narrow interpretations of Islamic texts by authorities, particularly in areas
relating to family law, are impeding the enjoyment of some human rights under the
Convention.”The committee criticized continued violations of children’s rights to
healthcare and education, conditions for juvenile detainees, inadequate safeguards
against physical or sexual abuse of children, and economic exploitation. Among
other things, the committee recommended implementation of the 1996 Children’s
Code and the systematic involvement of “civil society, especially children’s associations
and advocacy groups, throughout all stages of the implementation of the
Convention, including policy-making.”
In January also, the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination
against Women considered Egypt’s third, fourth, and fifth reports on its application
of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against
Women. The committee welcomed the reduction in female illiteracy rates and legislative
reforms aimed at eliminating discrimination against women, particularly
relating to divorce rights. However, it criticized other discriminatory laws, including
the Nationality Law which bars Egyptian women married to non-Egyptians
from passing on their nationality to their children, and certain provisions of the
penal code. The committee recommended legislative reforms in these areas, and
greater efforts by the authorities to prevent violence against women, including
domestic violence, marital rape, abuses against detained women, and female genital
mutilation.
In August, the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination
considered Egypt’s most recent reports on its implementation of the Convention
on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The committee noted the “significant role” of the Supreme Constitutional Court in “upholding human
rights and constitutional guarantees . . . as well as the prevention and elimination
of discrimination”but criticized the absence of legal provisions establishing that an
ethnic or racial motivation for defamation or acts of violence be considered an
aggravating factor. The committee also expressed concern about the discriminatory
provisions of the Nationality Law, noting the government’s promise to revise
it, and recommended speedy resolution of the “difficulties relating to the registration
of some non-governmental organizations dealing with the promotion and
protection of human rights,” particularly those working to combat racial discrimination.
The U.N. special rapporteur on torture, in his report to the Commission on
Human Rights published on January 25, concluded that “torture is systematically
practised by the security forces in Egypt, in particular by State Security Intelligence,”
and that despite government denials, the practice is “habitual, widespread
and deliberate in at least a considerable part of the country.”The special rapporteur
cited thirty-five cases of torture and thirty-two cases of death in custody reportedly
caused by torture or medical negligence that were transmitted to the government
between 1997 and 1999, to which the government replied in March and October
2000. He expressed particular concern at “the persistence of the explanation of
death in many of the cases as being ‘a sharp drop in blood pressure,’”and stated that
the government’s responses reinforced rather than alleviated his concerns. The
special rapporteur also criticized the government’s continuing failure to permit
him access to the country.
On May 25, the U.N. special representative on human rights defenders and the
special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers issued a joint statement
of concern about the conviction of Saadeddin Ibrahim and his co-defendants
following unfair trial procedures. They commented that “the conviction of these
members of civil society for their human rights activities will have a chilling effect
on the activities of other human rights defenders in Egypt,” and called for the
release of the defendants pending their appeal hearing.
European Union
On December 13, 2000, the European Commission (E.C.) issued a statement
concerning the charges levelled against Saadeddin Ibrahim and some of his codefendants
that they had misused E.C. funding of two projects administered by the
Ibn Khaldun Center and the Hoda Association.The projects, for which the E.C. had
provided a total of 315,000 euro, involved the promotion of voter education and the
exercise of political rights. The E.C. stated that “both the Ibn Khaldun and HODA
projects were the subject of external mid-term audits whose reports gave no cause
for concern, financial or otherwise.” On May 23, a spokesman for External Affairs
Commissioner Chris Patten expressed concern about the sentences passed on the
defendants in the case, and said that while E.U. aid to Egypt had not been suspended,
it was “encountering certain difficulties in its implementation.” On June
14, the European Parliament passed a resolution expressing concern about the verdict
and calling for Ibrahim “to be assured a fair trial,” expressing its support for the Ibn Khaldun Center and calling on the E.C. “to continue to support its initiatives.”
With reference to the case of Ibrahim and that of Nawal al-Sa’dawi, the resolution
called on the E.C. “to strengthen its MEDA programme for democracy, in cooperation
with the Egyptian authorities, in particular with a view to supporting freedom
of expression and the independence of the media.”
The Association Agreement between Egypt and the E.U.,which had been under
negotiation for over five years, was initialled by the two sides on January 26 and
signed on June 25. The agreement, which enters into force after ratification by the
parliaments of Egypt and of E.U. member states, covers economic, political, security,
and social relations between the two sides. Following the signing of the agreement,
Commissioner Patten stated that the “partnership is firmly based on shared
political and economic interests as well as a joint commitment for the promotion
of democracy and the respect of human rights.” He added that the human rights
provisions in the agreement would provide a framework within which human
rights issues would be raised with the Egyptian authorities.
United States
The U.S. maintained the previous year’s levels of foreign aid to Egypt, with the
Bush administration requesting for fiscal year 2002 an estimated U.S. $1.3 billion
for military assistance and U.S. $655 million for economic support funds. The
administration said military assistance would “support a modern, well-trained
Egyptian military that will help ensure stability in the region” and “enable Egypt to
participate as a coalition partner in operations that further U.S. interests.” Of the
funds requested for economic assistance, an estimated 14 percent was earmarked
for “programs meant to reduce the fertility rate, improve health care, support
democratic institutions and increase access to schooling for girls.”
Following the conviction and sentencing of Saadeddin Ibrahim and his codefendants,
a State Department spokesman said in a press briefing on May 21 that
“we are deeply troubled about the outcome, and . . . we have been expressing all
along our concerns about the process that resulted in this sentence.”U.S. embassy
staff in Cairo had observed the trial and visited Ibrahim, who held dual Egyptian-
U.S. citizenship, in Mazra’at Tora prison where he was taken after sentencing.
In its Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2000, the State Department
said that while the Egyptian government “generally respected the human rights of
its citizens in some areas, . . . its record was poor with respect to freedom of expression
and its treatment of detainees.” It pointed to the government’s use of emergency
laws to restrict “many basic rights,” including freedom of expression,
assembly, and association.
A delegation from the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom
visited Egypt from March 20-24 as part of a wider fact-finding tour of the Middle
East. It met with government officials, religious leaders, academics, journalists, and
NGO representatives, but several Egyptian human rights groups declined to cooperate
or assist the delegates. On March 28, the commission urged President George
W. Bush to raise the issue of religious freedoms with President Mubarak during the
latter’s U.S. visit in April. The commission’s detailed findings, released on May 14 as an addendum to its annual report, concluded that “serious problems of discrimination
against a number of religious groups remain widespread in Egypt,” including
Coptic Christians, Baha’is, and Muslims deemed by the authorities to be
“fundamentalists.
President Mubarak visited Washington, D.C. in the first week of April and held
talks with President Bush, political leaders, and representatives of the business
community. The visit focused on continuing efforts to salvage Israeli-Palestinian
peace negotiations and on economic ties between Egypt and the U.S., with Egypt
calling for a free trade agreement with the U.S.There was no indication that human
rights issues were discussed.
The Bush administration announced in November that an arms deal with Egypt
worth an estimated U.S. $400 million had been reached, and that economic aid to
Egypt would be accelerated to offset the adverse effects which the September 11
attacks on the U.S. were having on the Egyptian economy, notably the tourist
industry. On November 29, a legal assistance treaty between the U.S. and Egypt
came into effect, aimed at increasing cooperation in combatting transnational
crimes, including drug trafficking,money laundering, and “terrorist group financing,”
according to the State Department.
