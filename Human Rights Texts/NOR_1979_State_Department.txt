 NORWAY
 A strong belief in the rights of the individual, a long-
 standing respect for the law, an expanded social welfare
 system, and one of the highest living standards in the
 world provide the basis for Norway's continued excellent
 human rights record. Norway is a constitutional democ-
 racy with a long democratic tradition and broad public
 support for human rights. At the same time, however,
 Norwegians are beginning to discover that they are not
 totally immune to human rights problems, as occasional
 events involving the Lapp minority and recurrina minor vrob-
 lems with foreign workers illustrate. Norway is a
 signatory of both the International Covenant on Civil
 and Political Rights and the International Covenant on
 Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected
 in practice.
 b. Cruel; Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punish-
 ment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 Detention facilities maintain high standards.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaran-
 teed by law and respected in practice. There are no
 political prisoners in Norway.
 d. Denial of a Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice, both for Norwegian citizens and foreigners.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law
 and respected in practice.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Norway's mixed economy and far-reaching income distribu-
 tion system provide a substantial measure of economic
 equity. The rights of private ownership are respected.
 Extensive health care is guaranteed for all citizens, while
 education through the highest level is free to academically
 qualified students. Government policy aims specifically at
 meeting the basic health, education, and welfare needs of
 the population, with particular attention devoted to the
 less privileged elements of the. society.

 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. A lively and diverse free press monitors and
 regularly comments on the human rights environment in
 Norway. The government-owned television and radio stations
 strive to offer balanced programming and encourage serious
 debate from all political groups.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of movement, foreign travel and emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political participation in Norway's constitutional demo-
 cracy is high by any standard. Over 80% of the voting
 population (all citizens over 18 and other citizens of
 Scandinavia who are resident in Norway) consistently par-
 ticipate in Parliamentary elections. The trade union
 movement is active and influential. The principal labor
 organization negotiates directly with the government every
 other year to reach agreement on wage demands. Women
 occupy a prominent position in Norwegian society, com-
 prising 40% of the work force and an increasingly important
 percentage of elected officials. Two of Ehe 15 cabinet
 members are women, as are 37 of the 155 members of the
 Parliament. Women are increasingly more evident in re-
 sponsible positions in the various government ministries
 but are much less visible in private business.
 A well-publicized demonstration by a few members of the
 Lapp minority highlights some discontent with the govern-
 ment's attention to Lapp problems. The public is also
 becoming more aware of the problems faced by foreign workers
 in Norway, particularly by some 7500 Pakistanis and Indians.
 Only recently have Norwegians begun to admit that such
 workers may encounter discrimination in Norwegian society.
 4. Governmental Attitudes and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 No requests have been made for outside investigation of
 the human rights situation in Norway.
