Afghanistan
Afghanistan is experiencing its worst violence since the fall of the Taliban government.
Widespread human rights abuses, warlordism, and impunity persist, with a
government that lacks the strength or will to institute necessary reforms.
Corruption and an escalating cost of living are affecting millions.
The Taliban and other militants have extended their control into parts of the country
previously considered relatively stable, such as Logar and Wardak which border
Kabul province, and parts of Herat province in the west. Kabul was a target of
several audacious militant attacks in 2008, with several major roads out of the
capital becoming dangerous to travel. Civilians continue to bear the brunt of militants’
bomb attacks. Civilian deaths resulting from international military actions
also remain high, with hundreds of preventable deaths occurring in 2007 and
2008.
Violence and Insecurity
As the violence spirals, each year that passes is declared bloodier than the last.
2008 was no exception. Insurgent groups have been responsible for approximately
two-thirds of civilian deaths. In the first seven months of 2008, the UN estimates
that improvised explosive devices and suicide attacks killed almost 500
civilians. Antigovernment forces routinely violate the laws of war by launching
attacks from civilian areas or retreating to such areas, knowingly drawing return
fire.
The targeting of individuals associated with the government is also on the rise,
from school teachers to human rights defenders, with the United Nations recording
over a hundred assassinations in 2008. The Taliban claimed responsibility for
the September killing of Afghanistan’s highest-ranking female police officer,
Lieutenant-Colonel Malalai Kakar.
Despite operational improvements, significant numbers of civilians also continue
to be killed by US and NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)
airstrikes, inflaming public opinion and undermining the government. In July
2008, a mistaken US bombing of a wedding party in Deh Bala, Nangahar province, killed 47 civilians. Denials and lack of transparency have made the situation
worse. In August, US forces bombed the village of Azizabad; the UN, the
government, and the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission said more
than 90 civilians were killed. The US initially denied that any more than seven
civilians had been killed, but weeks later raised the figure to 33.
Increasingly under joint command, the US and ISAF have now agreed to hold joint
investigations with the Afghanistan government. Too often a faulty condolencepayment
system has not provided timely and adequate compensation to assist
civilians harmed by US and ISAF actions.
Outside the conflict areas, organized crime and warlords terrorize Afghans with
impunity. Kidnapping of Afghans for ransom is common, but the police seem
largely incapable or unwilling to tackle it.
Governance and Impunity
The Afghan government continues to lose public legitimacy because of widespread
corruption, failure to improve living standards, and lack of progress in
establishing the rule of law even in areas under its control. Afghans frequently
cite police corruption as a problem, with internationally funded police reform
efforts showing limited impact. The UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial
killings, Philip Alston, visited Afghanistan in May 2008 and drew attention to the
impunity police generally enjoy after they have been accused of killing civilians.
President Hamid Karzai’s government has done little to implement the Action
Plan for Peace, Reconciliation and Justice, a five-year plan for implementing transitional
justice in Afghanistan, part of the Afghanistan Compact which the government
officially initiated on December 12, 2006. The legal status of an amnesty for
war criminals, passed by parliament in 2007, is still unclear. But the tone of the
debate on transitional justice is still being dominated by the influential group of
parliamentarians that pushed the resolution through, including Abdul Rabb al
Rasul Sayyaf, Burhanuddin Rabbani, and Taj Mohammad, all of whom have been
implicated in war crimes and other serious human rights abuses. The Karzai
administration appears powerless to challenge them.
Women and Girls
Afghan women and girls rank among the world’s worst-off by most indicators,
including maternal mortality, life expectancy, and literacy.
Insecurity prevents the vast majority of girls from attending school in the south
and southeast. In Kandahar in November 2008, several schoolgirls had acid
thrown at their faces on their way to school. Even in conflict-free areas, Afghan
girls continue to face immense obstacles to education such as lack of girls’
schools, sexual harassment en route to school, and early marriage which tends to
prematurely end schooling. According to Ministry of Education data, 46 percent of
primary school-aged girls were enrolled in primary school, compared with 74 percent
of boys. At the secondary level only 8 percent of girls and 18 percent of boys
were enrolled.
Women still confront widespread discrimination, significant barriers to working
outside the home, and restrictions on their mobility; many still cannot travel without
an accompanying male relative and a burqa.
Children
As part of their campaign of terrorizing the civilian population, the Taliban and
other insurgent groups continue to target schools, and in particular girls’ schools.
According to the Ministry of Education, over one hundred schools were attacked
between March and October 2008, with the Afghanistan NGO Security Office
recording more than 30 teachers and students killed in the first 10 months of
2008.
According to the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, child labor is
prevalent throughout the country and is another reason children do not attend
school.
The UN special representative for children and armed conflict drew attention in
2008 to the largely taboo practice of bacha bazi (the keeping of boys as sex
slaves by wealthy or powerful patrons). The government of Afghanistan has done
little to tackle this abusive cultural tradition.

Key International Actors
In the immediate aftermath of the overthrow of the Taliban in 2002-2003, the
international community’s stated aim was to extend the reach of central government,
in order to avoid the vacuum of weak or absent government being exploited
by the insurgency. Foreign military powers, donors, and the UN have since
failed to prioritize governance and the rule of law, contributing to the growth of
insurgency in Afghanistan and the diminution of central government control.
The Paris donor conference in June 2008 offered donors a chance to address fundamental
problems of impunity, women’s rights, freedom of expression, transitional
justice, and judicial reform. Instead, donors largely offered more of the
same, with few conditions attached to aid.
The UN operation in Afghanistan remains understaffed, with the human rights
and rule of law office well below capacity. The UN special representative for
Afghanistan, Kai Eide, who took charge in April 2008, has not prioritized human
rights.
International security forces, in particular US forces, have focused much of their
efforts on killing or capturing al Qaeda and Taliban leaders, rather than providing
a safer environment for Afghans to enjoy their basic rights.
The US military operates in Afghanistan without an adequate legal framework,
such as a status-of-forces agreement, and continues to detain hundreds of
Afghans without adequate legal process. The expanding US-run Bagram detention
facility holds over 600 prisoners, including children, who are given negligible
legal rights. Unlike at Guantanamo, prisoners at Bagram are not allowed to see
lawyers. Administrative review of detainees’ cases is cursory. The detainees have
no right to a personal advocate, no opportunity to review the evidence against
them, and very little means of contesting the grounds for their detention.
