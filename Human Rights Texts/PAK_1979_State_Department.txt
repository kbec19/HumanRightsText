 PAKISTAN
 On October 16, 1979 President Zia indefinitely postponed
 national elections, dissolved all political parties,
 expanded the jurisdiction of military courts and imposed
 formal censorhip of newspapers.
 Former Prime Minister Bhutto was executed on April 4, 1979
 after a lengthy trial on charges of conspiracy to murder and
 an unsuccessful appeal to the Pakistan Supreme Court.
 Following the execution the Martial Law Administration (MLA)
 continued to monitor closely the activities of Bhutto's
 Pakistan Peoples' Party (PPP). Bhutto's widow, daughter,
 and other PPP leaders were placed under house arrest in
 October and were still under detention at the end of 1979.
 On November 21, 1979 large scale anti-American demonstrations
 took place in Islamabad, Karachi and Lahore. Two American
 and two Pakistani employees were killed in mob violence and
 the American Embassy in Islamabad was virtually destroyed by
 fire. The Government of Pakistan apologized for the
 incident, offered to pay for the damages and reaffirmed its
 responsibilities for the protection of foreign diplomats.
 Pakistan is currently providing refuge to massive numbers of
 refugees fleeing political and religious persecution and the
 unsettled conditions in Afghanistan.  (The number of
 refugees was approaching 500,000 in late January 1980, and
 is growing daily.) Despite its own limited resources and
 the political tensions created by Soviet intervention in
 Afghanistan, Pakistan willingly has shouldered the
 humanitarian burden thrust upon it. The generous assistance
 provided by the Pakistan Government is now being supplemented
 by a growing international program under the leadership of
 the U. N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 There have been no substantial reports of torture under the
 present martial law government. The 1973 Constitution bans
 torture.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The Government has endorsed the establishment of punishments
 codified in the Sharia, the Islamic traditional code.
 Following the October 16 announcement there was an increase
 in public floggings. On October 25, twenty-seven men were
 flogged in Rawalpindi before thousands of spectators.
 Amputation has also been approved as punishment for certain
 crimes. Although some sentences have been announced, no
 amputations have been carried out.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrests or Imprisonment
 Limited preventive detention of persons who might act in a
 manner "prejudicial" to the regime is authorized under
 Martial Law Order (MLO) 12 of July 1979. Under this
 authority there have been a substantial number of detentions
 without charge or trial of political figures associated with
 the previous regime. Those detained included former Prime
 Minister Bhutto's wife and daughter who were placed under
 house arrest on several occasions in 1979. After President
 Zia's announcement of October 16, Nusrat Bhutto, Benazir
 
 (810)
 
 
 811
 Bhutto and other prominent politicians were arrested. Most
 of these were members of Mrs. Bhutto's PPP. Those arrested
 have been released gradually since October 16. Toward the
 end of December, the Punjab Government released several
 important leaders. The Lahore and Sind High Courts have
 released others.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 During the initial period of martial law rule, the
 Government made extensive use of military tribunals to
 supplement or, in some cases, to substitute for the civil
 courts. The right to counsel is routinely a part of
 proceedings at both the general and special courts martial
 levels. Prior to October 16, 1979 the overall trend was to
 remove the military from martial law adjudications and to
 rely increasingly on civil courts. Following President
 Zia's October 16 announcement the jurisdiction and powers of
 military tribunals has increased. According to Martial Law
 Order #72, military courts are authorized to try virtually
 all criminal cases in Pakistan. The order also bars any
 civil court from exercising jurisdiction in any matter "to
 which the jurisdiction of a military court or tribunal
 extends..." However, the final word has yet to be heard on
 this subject and on the broad constitutional issues at
 stake. Some of the provincial courts are still showing
 considerable independence in their actions. In December
 1979 the Lahore High Court ordered the release of 47
 political figures who had been held under preventive
 detention.
 Prior to October 16 the Supreme Court placed legal
 limitations on the extra-judicial acts of the martial law
 authorities. The civil courts were regularly issuing
 effective writs of habeas corpus in the cases of almost all
 detained persons. There were no known cases where attorneys'
 services were denied to detainees and some detainees were
 released by the Government without reference to the courts.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 Police are required to obtain a warrant before entering a
 residence. Pakistani authorities nearly always respect
 inviolability of the home. During 1979, aside from one
 public allegation of forced entry, the Department of State
 received no reports of police residential searches or
 arrests, conducted without proper warrant.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The Government is committed in principle to meeting basic
 human needs. Income distribution is less skewed than is the
 case in many other developing countries. At present, the
 richest five percent of households receive 17.5 percent of
 income while the poorest 20 percent receive 8.4 percent. The
 Government of Pakistan has instituted a few programs to
 expand agricultural production, such as a dry-land wheat
 project in the Punjab and programs to facilitate
 construction of tubewells and the distribution and use of
 pesticides and fertilizers. President Zia has stated that
 he wishes to maintain a balance between the promotion of
 industrial investment and provisions for the rural poor. In
 practice, expanded programs for the rural poor have been
 more difficult to promote because of budgetary constraints.
 The Government is continuing foreign-supported projects for
 housing, electrification, education and health in rural
 areas.
 
 
 812
 Tens of thousands of Pakistanis, with Government
 encouragement, have been recruited to work in the Middle
 East. Their remittances to family members remaining in
 Pakistan total about $1.5 billion per year, and have led to
 a significant increase in the standard of living of these
 families.
 There is a serious housing shortage in urban areas. The
 construction industry was particularly hard hit by the
 emigration of laborers and faces shortages of materials and
 trained manpower. The Government does not have sufficient
 resources to mount a housing program capable of meeting the
 growing demand.
 There was a large concentration of public sector investment
 capital in a few large capital projects inherited from the
 previous government. The present government feels obligated
 for political and economic reasons to continue them.
 Recognizing its fiscal limitations in implementing
 development programs, the Government has begun to encourage
 greater private sector activity.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 During their first year in office, the martial law
 authorities limited political activities and expression
 through martial law orders and regulations. In 1979, these
 restrictions were modified and the expression of a wider
 variety of political opinion was permitted. The
 liberalization continued until October 16, 1979 when strict
 censorship was reintroduced and at least four opposition
 newspapers were closed down.
 On November 29, 1979 Salamat Ali, a Pakistani correspondent
 for the Far Eastern Economic Review, was sentenced to a year
 of "rigorous imprisonment" by a military court. The
 Government of Pakistan accused him of violating Martial Law
 Regulations 4, 13 and 15. Regulation 4 prohibits writing
 articles to promote or attempt to promote hatred between
 different provinces, classes, sects or religious orders.
 Regulation 13 prohibits creating hatred or disaffection
 toward martial law authorities. Regulation 15 prohibits
 inciting the public to seek dismemberment of Pakistan.
 Traditionally women have held subordinate roles. The All
 Pakistan Women's Federation is the principle women's
 interest group but has had little influence with the
 Government.
 Minority groups continue to be denied certain rights enjoyed
 by Muslims, but were allowed to participate in the local
 elections in September 1979. The Ahmadiya sect is included
 with Christians, Parsis, Hindus and others in the category
 of minorities. Thus, Ahmadiyas cannot be elected President
 or Prime Minister.  (The Ahmadiyas consider themselves
 Muslims, but the Government regards them as non-Muslim
 because they are unable to certify that they believe
 Mohammad was the last prophet.)
 The Government of Pakistan has not impeded the Human Rights
 Society (HRS) of Pakistan, which includes among its officers
 a leading Pakistani elder statesman and a prominent labor
 leader. The HRS spoke out against the imposition of the
 death penalty on Bhutto. Political parties have organized
 "legal aid bureaux" and provide free legal services to
 members placed under arrest.
 
 
 813
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Restrictions on travel are enforced mainly against a limited
 number of opposition political leaders and their families.
 A 1978 martial law regulation imposes a penalty of up to
 fourteen years' confinement and confiscation of property for
 persons failing to appear before a military or civilian
 inquiry. This appears to be aimed at prominent opposition
 politicians who have fled the country and makes it more
 difficult for other opposition politicians to leave.
 Pakistani workers are free to emigrate to work abroad; the
 Government assists them to do so and accepts them upon their
 return.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 General Zia ul-Haq in 1977 ousted the Bhutto regime which
 had just won an election that was widely believed to have
 been rigged. Zia claimed that the ouster was necessary
 because of the rigging of elections, arbitrary detention of
 thousands of political prisoners, a breakdown of law and
 order, and widespread corruption, conditions that he felt
 threatened civil war.
 The Zia regime promised to reverse the "corrupt and
 capricious" practices of the former Bhutto Government and to
 return power to representative civilian authority through
 elections in late 1977. General Zia later postponed
 elections, and after more than a year he again committed
 himself to elections in the fall of 1979. On October 16,
 1979, he postponed elections once more, this time for "an
 indefinite period." Meanwhile, non-party elections were
 held in September 1979 to fill seats on local and municipal
 councils throughout the country. These "local bodies" are
 the first to be elected by universal suffrage in 15 years.
 They are now functioning, albeit in a constrained political
 environment, dominated increasingly by the civil service.
 The Government promulgated two Presidential ordinances in
 1978 affecting political freedom. One of these, "the
 Freedom of Association Order of 1978," guaranteed all
 citizens, except Government employees, the right to form and
 participate in political parties. The other new ordinance
 modified existing law on political parties to prohibit
 parties opposed to "Islamic ideology or the integrity or
 security of Pakistan." The act also prohibits political
 parties from maintaining any sort of foreign affiliation or
 funding. In August 1979, the MLA again modified the basic
 election law of 1962 to limit further the possibility of
 parties considered hostile to the MLA from gaining too much
 strength in the forthcoming elections. In October President
 Zia dissolved all political parties.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 According to Amnesty International's 1979 report, at least
 7,000 political opponents of the regime were in prison as of
 May 1979. AI also stated that it has received dozens of
 reports alleging torture of political prisoners in Pakistan.
 On February 23, 1979 AI sent a mission to Pakistan to attend
 the opening hearing of the Supreme Court on the Bhutto
 appeal. The AI mission's report noted that three of the
 seven Supreme Court Judges had found that the prosecution
 
 
 814
 had "failed to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt" and
 the existence of a minority view among the judges should be
 a "powerful, if not overwhelming factor" in determining
 whether to commute the death penalty.
 In a cable to President Zia on the day of Mr. Bhutto's
 execution, Al called for an immediate halt to all executions
 and the abolition of the death penalty in Pakistan. AI
 pointed out that the number of executions every year in
 Pakistan was among the highest in Asia and that President
 Zia had indicated that he had dismissed all clemency appeals
 against the death penalty since coming to office. AI
 stressed that there were substantial legal and humanitarian
 grounds to granting clemency to hundreds executed every
 year, many of them civilians convicted by military courts
 applying summary rules of evidence.
 On November 14, 1979 Amnesty International said there had
 been at least 300 political arrests following Zia's October
 16 speech and a "sharp increase in the number of cruel,
 inhuman and degrading punishments handed down by the
 country's military courts." Amnesty voiced its grave
 concern at what it termed a dramatic deterioration of human
 rights in Pakistan and claimed that there were several
 thousand political prisoners, hundreds of whom had been
 flogged.
 The Department of State estimates that more than 100 of
 those detained in October have now been released. In
 addition, those rounded up at the time of Bhutto's execution
 have been freed. The Department of State believes there are
 considerably fewer than a thousand individuals still
 detained on grounds which properly might be described as
 political. I-ost of those individuals are members of the
 PPP, who are under martial law 90-day preventive detention
 orders. None had been flogged.
