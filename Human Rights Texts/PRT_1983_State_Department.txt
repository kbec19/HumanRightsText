 PORTUGAL
 Since Portugal's peaceful transition from authoritarian to
 democratic rule in 1974, vigorous democratic institutions have
 been established, and Portugal today enjoys a pluralistic,
 multiparty parliamentary democracy with broad popular
 legitimacy. The Government is appointed by the President and
 dependent upon support of Parliament. Members of Parliament
 and the President of the Republic are freely elected by the
 people. The young democracy was consolidated in 1982 with the
 abolition of the Council of the Revolution, which had provided
 the military a role in overseeing government acts.
 The 1982 revision of the Constitution not only consolidated the
 guarantees of civil liberties contained in the 1976
 Constitution but also allowed for a more open economy.
 Nationalizations and agrarian reform immediately after the 1974
 Revolution established the primary role of the state in certain
 areas of commerce, industry, and agriculture. In 1983 the
 Government adopted an economic reform program designed to open
 the nationalized banking, insurance, fertilizer, and cement
 sectors to competition from private enterprise.
 Portugal has not had a civilian intelligence service since the
 abolition of the secret police structure of the previous
 dictatorship. There has been some controversy about whether an
 intelligence apparatus with appropriate safeguards should be
 reestablished. In the wake of an Armenian terrorist attack on
 the Turkish Embassy in 1983, the Government decided that an
 intelligence or information service should be created along the
 lines of those which exist in other Western European
 democracies.
 Portugal enjoys a healthy human rights climate, despite
 existence of a minor indigenous terrorist movement and
 terrorist attacks by Palestinians and Armenians in 1983.
 Respect for civil and political rights, due process, and the
 integrity of the person are supported by the Government and
 reinforced by a free press. The status of human rights
 practices is expected to remain favorable in both the short and
 long term.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Government-sanctioned political killings have not occurred in
 Portugal in the reporting period. Although there were
 terrorist killings by foreigners, there were no killings by
 Portuguese terrorist groups in 1983.
 b. Disappearance
 The police and armed forces have not abducted or secretly
 arrested and detained individuals during 1983. In the
 reporting period there were no terrorist abductions or
 hostage-takings by Portuguese opposition groups.
 (1072)
 
 
 1073
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution forbids torture and the use of evidence
 obtained by torture in criminal proceedings. There has been no
 known torture in Portugal since the secret police was abolished
 in 1974. The Constitution also prohibits cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment or punishment, which is punishable by fine
 or imprisonment. There has been no convincing evidence of such
 treatment or punishment since November 1975.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 No one can be held legally for more than 48 hours unless a
 prosecuting judge orders preventive detention, which may last a
 maximum of three years for each alleged crime. Since November
 1975, there have been a few cases in which individuals were
 held without specific charges longer than 48 hours. In those
 cases, defense lawyers were able to obtain due process for
 their clients through legal efforts and publicity. Preventive
 detention for six to nine months before trial is not unusual
 for individuals accused of serious crimes, such as murder or
 armed robbery. A large backlog of cases in the courts and some
 vacant judgeships have caused trial delays. Judges are
 required to give priority to the cases of those under
 preventive detention.
 The law requires the use of warrants, and the mandate is widely
 observed in practice. An exception is made when the police
 catch someone in the act of committing a crime for which he is
 liable to imprisonment for at least three years. While habeas
 corpus exists, it is little used because it has no tradition in
 the Portuguese judicial process and because of the law of
 preventive detention. Bail is encouraged by law whenever
 feasible but is unusual for those accused of serious crimes.
 The law provides that persons arrested are to be informed of
 the charges against them and are to be allowed access to a
 lawyer of their choice. Court-appointed defenders are
 available for those who cannot afford to hire an attorney. No
 one has been exiled under the 1976 Constitution or its 1982
 revision.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Portugal has an independent judiciary and a fair judicial
 system. All trials are public except those which may offend
 the dignity of the victim, such as in cases involving child
 sexual abuse. The accused is presumed innocent until
 convicted. A prosecuting judge develops the case against an
 accused person, brings formal charges, and sends the case to
 trial. If the crime involves a victim, the victim may appoint
 a private prosecuting lawyer to assist the prosecuting judge.
 Participating in the trial are the accused, one or more judges,
 the ministerial delegate, and the defense attorney.  The
 accused may request a jury in trials involving major crimes,
 but in practice juries are rare. The delegate's duty is to
 help the judge or judges sift through the evidence; the verdict
 is rendered by the judge, judges, or jury. The sentence must
 be pronounced in the presence of the defense attorney.
 There are no political prisoners in Portugal, although the
 extreme left opposition charges that a handful of people who
 have been sentenced for violent acts, criminal conspiracy, or
 inciting to violence are political prisoners.
 
 
 1074
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 No cases of interference with the privacy of the individual by
 the Government occurred in 1983. There is no forced membership
 in political organizations. There has been no generalized
 governmental monitoring of correspondence or telephones, or an
 informer system since the 1974 revolution. Under the
 Constitution, forced entry into homes and searches require a
 judicial order; entry into a home at night requires the consent
 of the occupants. Any violation of this constitutional
 requirement would immediately be subject to official and press
 scrutiny.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and of the press is guaranteed under the
 Constitution. Effective freedom of speech and press, including
 academic freedom and freedom from government censorship is
 fully supported by the Government. The opposition is free to
 voice its point of view and criticism of the Government is
 tolerated, with two restrictions:
 First, "Fascist" organizations and activities, including
 discussion of corporativism, are prohibited by the so-called
 "anti-Fascist law" of June 1978. Violators are liable to
 imprisonment for a period of from two to eight years. In
 practice, politicians associated with the former regime freely
 engage in political activity, and there have been no "Fascist"
 prosecutions. There are no laws prohibiting political activity
 by extreme leftists.
 Second, anyone found guilty of "insulting" civil or military
 bodies or the President of the Republic, if the "insult" was
 intended to undermine the rule of law, may be imprisoned for up
 to three years. There were no convictions for "insults" in
 1983.
 The Portuguese Government acquired indirect ownership of a
 significant number of the country's newspapers by nationalizing
 the banks, to which they had become heavily indebted. The
 Government does not, however, control newspaper editorial
 content. The entire political spectrum is represented in the
 printed media.
 All television and most of the radio stations belong to the
 state, and the Government appoints their administrators; these
 administrators change with governments. In principle, the
 Government should not influence broadcast media policies or
 reporting decisions, and it does not do so directly. Some
 subtle influences, however, may be unavoidable. Opposition
 parties (particularly the Communists) sometimes charge that
 television and radio ignore or distort their activities or
 political views.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Individuals have the right, in law and practice, to associate
 formally or informally, to promote nonviolent causes, or to
 protest government policies. Formation of a political party
 requires 5,000 subscribers. Public meetings or protests
 require that 24 hours' notice be given the civil governor.
 Permission is routinely granted.
 
 
 1075
 Workers have the constitutional right to set up unions by
 profession or industry. Striking is permitted for any reason,
 including political reasons. Approximately 45 percent of the
 work force is unionized. Unions are free from government
 control but closely associated with political parties. There
 are two labor federations. One, the General Confederation of
 Portuguese Workers, is controlled by the Communist Party and
 active in Communist-sponsored causes. The other, the General
 Union of Workers, is a pluralist democratic union, the
 leadership of which is associated with the Socialist and Social
 Democratic parties. Several members of the General Union of
 Workers were elected to Parliament in 1983. There are no legal
 restrictions on contacts with international labor bodies. Since
 both federations wish to represent Portugal at the International
 Labor Organization, the Minister of Labor has decided that each
 will represent Portugal in alternate years. In addition, the
 General Union of Workers is affiliated with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the European Trade Union
 Congress.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion, and the Government does nothing to
 discourage or interfere with the free practice of religion,
 including missionary activity and religious publishing.
 Organized religions may freely establish places of worship,
 train their clergy, proselytize, and convert.  In order to
 qualify as a tax-exempt institution, an organized religion must
 legally establish itself as a nonprofit private society.
 The most prevalent religion is Roman Catholic. Catholic
 religious instruction is offered as an elective in the public
 schools. Pursuit of a civil, military, professional, or
 political career is not dependent on adherence to a particular
 creed.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation \\
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of movement, foreign travel,
 and emigration. There are no formal restraints on domestic
 travel, on the right of a citizen to change his residence or
 work place, or on emigration. Currency restrictions, resulting
 from a chronic balance-of-payments problem, in practice, impose
 some limitations on the foreign travel of Portuguese citizens.
 Emigrants and those who travel abroad are free to return;
 citizenship is not revoked for political reasons.
 A law of August 1980 established a humane refugee program.
 Displaced persons who qualify as refugees under the technical
 definition established by the United Nations are given permanent
 resident status and allowed to work. In practice, no displaced
 persons are forced to return to a place they have fled or where
 they fear persecution.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 The Portuguese President and Parliament are elected by secret
 ballot by universal adult suffrage under a democratic system.
 Opposition parties and candidates operate freely and enjoy
 access to the media. Only "Fascist" organizations are
 outlawed. General elections for Parliament are held at least
 
 
 1076
 every four years. The President enjoys a five-year mandate,
 but may serve no more than two consecutive terms.
 The Civil Code guarantees full legal equality for women in
 accordance with the Constitution. Portugal was one of the
 first signatories of the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of
 All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. In 1979, a woman
 served as Prime Minister. Five women at present serve as
 Secretaries of State (Deputy Ministers) in the national
 Government. Women play an active role in the political
 parties, but still remain underrepresented in party and
 government leadership positions.
 The population is overwhelmingly European and ethnically
 homogeneous. There is a small African minority, much of which
 immigrated to Portugal when the former African colonies won
 their independence following the 1974 revolution. There are no
 restrictions on political activity by Portuguese of African
 heritage.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Portugal has cooperated with independent, outside
 investigations of human rights conditions and has taken the
 issue of human rights in East Timor to the United Nations.
 Portugal signed the Helsinki Accords and actively participates
 in the human rights activities of the Council of Europe.
 Amnesty International and other private international human
 rights groups operate freely in Portugal. In October 1983, the
 Fourth International Sakharov hearings were held in Lisbon with
 the Prime Minister as honorary president. The President of the
 Republic inaugurated a conference sponsored by the Council of
 Europe on the subject of Human Rights and the Rights of
 Foreigners.
 The most important domestic human rights group is the
 Portuguese section of the International Committee of Jurists,
 which considers the human rights situation in Portugal to be
 .exemplary." In its 1983 report on Portugal, Amnesty
 International's sole concern was the length of time involved in
 formal proceedings against some members of the Proletarian
 Revolutionary Party, who have been charged with terrorist
 activities. Freedom House rates Portugal "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 According to World Bank data, in 1981 the per capita gross
 national product (GNP) was $2,534. The Portuguese Government,
 however, places the 1981 figure at $2,440 per capita, and the
 1982 figure at $2,352, a decline in per capita income. In 1980
 the adult literacy rate was 71 percent, 78 percent for males
 and 65 percent for females. In the late 1970's primary school
 enrollment ratio was 118 percent, 120 percent for males and 116
 percent for females. Infant mortality in 1983 was 26 per 1,000
 live births. In 1976, 90 percent of the urban population and
 56 percent of the rural population had access to safe water.
 Life expectancy in 1980 was 70.8 years. Portugal has
 integrated almost three-quarters of a million returnees from
 its former colonies since 1975. Approximately one-tenth of the
 population of 10,008,000 lived and worked outside of Portugal
 in 1983. The population growth rate is 0.8 percent.
 
 
 1077
 The Government has instituted a large-scale school construction
 program to improve educational opportunities. Free primary
 school education is now available throughout the country. In
 1977, the primary school enrollment ratio (students enrolled in
 primary education as a percentage of population in the
 appropriate age group) was 117, 119 for males and 115 for
 females. New regional colleges are spreading higher education
 beyond the traditional centers of Coimbra, Lisbon, and Oporto.
 Portugal currently imports about 60 percent of its food needs.
 A worsening of the economic situation, including widening
 deficits in both the balance of payments and domestic budget,
 has forced the Government to begin dismembering its system of
 subsidization of basic food and agricultural commodities.
 While prices of these items have gone up, the nutritional
 balance is still believed to be more than adequate, given the
 wide range of supplies available locally.
 Food, shelter, health care, and education are available to all
 inhabitants regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background, or political opinion.
 The Constitution guarantees full legal equality for women.
 Portugal was among the first signatories of the U.N. Convention
 on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against
 Women. In 1979, a woman, Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo, held the
 position of Prime Minister in Portugal. Women play an active
 role in the political parties, but remain underrepresented in
 party and government leadership positions. The status of women
 in Portuguese society has shown considerable improvement since
 the 1974 revolution.
