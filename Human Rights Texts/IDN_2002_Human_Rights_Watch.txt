INDONESIA
Indonesia had another turbulent year, marked by a power struggle in Jakarta
and an escalation in regional conflicts. The war in Aceh and an outbreak of
communal violence in West Kalimantan produced the most civilian casualties, but
conflicts in the Moluccas, Central Sulawesi, and Papua continued to simmer. By
October, the number of displaced persons remained well over one million, half of
them from the Moluccas.
The government made no serious efforts to address past or current abuses, new
human rights legislation notwithstanding. The number of political prisoners rose
steadily during the year, with many peaceful political activists charged with
“spreading hatred toward the government,” an offense associated with the government
of former president Soeharto. The justice system remained a shambles.
Defending human rights remained a dangerous occupation, particularly in
Aceh, where at least seven rights workers were killed.
Indonesia’s bilateral donors showed concern over the regional conflicts, but
their main focus was the long drawn-out struggle in Jakarta between the parliament
and President Abdurrahman Wahid. That conflict ended peacefully in late
July with Wahid’s impeachment and the accession to the presidency of Megawati
Sukarnoputri. A combination of relief over the transition, delight over some key
cabinet appointees, and strategic and economic interests led many donors to rush
to support the new administration.
In late 2001, widespread protests in Indonesian cities against the U.S. bombing
of Afghanistan, accompanied by some intimidation ofWesterners,underscored the
difficulties President Megawati faced in balancing domestic political constituencies
with external pressures.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
The power struggle between President Abdurrahman Wahid and the Indonesian
parliament consumed so much energy of the political elite that all of the country’s
major problems were left to fester.The Indonesian parliament, following decidedly
unclear constitutional guidelines, formally censured Wahid on February 1 and
again on April 30 over two financial scandals.At the end of May, the attorney-general
ruled there was no evidence of presidential involvement in the scandals, but the
parliament continued the de facto impeachment process on grounds of presidential
incompetence. On July 23, the People’s Consultative Assembly, Indonesia’s
highest legislative body, ignored a decree from Wahid disbanding parliament and
convened a special session during which those present voted unanimously to
remove Wahid and replace him with Megawati.
Megawati’s first cabinet had some strengths, but her choice of attorney-general
was poor. The new minister, M.A. Rahman, was a career prosecutor known for
obstructing human rights cases, particularly with regard to East Timor.
The appointment continued a pattern of one step forward, two steps back that
marked successive governments’ approach to accountability. In November 2000,
the parliament passed Law No. 26 setting up new courts to try cases of serious
human rights violations. For the first time, crimes against humanity, war crimes,
and other crimes of a “widespread or systematic” nature were incorporated into
Indonesian law. The law established new courts to try such cases prospectively and
provided for the establishment of “ad hoc” courts to prosecute serious human
rights abuses that had occurred before the law took effect, including the 1999 East
Timor cases.
But President Wahid’s attorney-general, Marzuki Darusman, dithered and by
the time the Wahid government fell, had failed to set up the courts or proceed with
a single prosecution. His accomplice in procrastination was M.A. Rahman, appointed
by Megawati to succeed him. As of October 2001, prosecutors for the new
courts had been named, as had some but not all of the judges. Indictments were
promised for December.
Other problems with accountability surfaced. The Indonesian National
Human Rights Commission, known as Komnas-HAM, had been one of the most
courageous defenders of human rights during the late Soeharto years. Ironically,
it began to lose its critical edge under the democratically-elected Abdurrahman
Wahid. Law No. 26 gave Komnas-HAM, rather than the police, responsibility for
initial investigations into cases of serious human rights violations, but leading
obstructionists within Komnas-HAM itself increasingly blocked action on key
cases. A bill in the parliament to set up a national truth and reconciliation commission
along the lines of the South African model remained undiscussed as of
late 2001.With no interest in prosecutions on the part of the president, the attorney
general, or the minister of justice, let alone the military, prospects for accountability
looked bleaker than ever.
Aceh
The situation in Aceh deteriorated sharply during the year, and a six-hour visit
in September by Megawati to the area made little difference.The 2001 death toll had
topped 1,300 by September, and while most of the deaths were civilians killed in the
course of military operations, the rebel Free Aceh Movement (Gerakan Aceh
Merdeka or GAM) was also responsible for serious abuses.
In early November 2000, Indonesian security forces tried to prevent a rally
organized by the Information Center for a Referendum on Aceh (Sentral Informasi
Referendum Aceh or SIRA) in the provincial capital, Banda Aceh. They blocked
people from reaching the city, including by shooting at sea and land transport;
arrested and beat up members of the organizing committee; and raided offices of
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in the lead-up to the rally. On November
20, the head of SIRA, Muhammad Nazar, was arrested on charges of “spreading
hatred” for having hung banners in favor of a referendum and against the Indonesian
military during a campus rally the previous August.He was convicted in March
2001 and sentenced to ten months in prison.With time served, he was released in
October.
On December 6, 2000, four workers for an organization called Rehabilitation
Action for Torture Victims of Aceh or RATA, were stopped outside Lhokseumawe,
North Aceh, and abducted by a group of armed soldiers and civilians.Two men and
a woman were executed; a fourth escaped and gave testimony identifying several of
the killers. Later that month, four civilians and four military men were arrested.
The civilians “escaped”—they were almost certainly let go with official connivance—
from a police barracks in Medan, North Sumatra on March 22, 2001.
One of them was back in Aceh in June, terrorizing local activists. The soldiers
reportedly remained in the military police detention center in Medan as of October.
Efforts by some within Komnas-HAM to have the RATA murders treated as
serious enough to warrant prosecution by the new human rights courts were
blocked by some of their own colleagues, and the prosecutor in Banda Aceh maintained
in May that he lacked enough evidence to proceed with a trial.
On March 29, a human rights lawyer, Suprin Sulaiman, together with his client,
Teungku Kamal, and a driver, Amiruddin, were shot dead shortly after leaving the South Aceh district police station where Tgk. Kamal had been summoned as a suspect
in criminal defamation of the police. In February, he had allegedly helped
NGOs rescue five women that they believed were victims of sexual assault by the
paramilitary police, Brimob. The women were brought to Banda Aceh where their
case was widely covered by the local press.As they were returning home, the police
took them into custody, whereupon they changed their stories, saying they had
been forced by GAM to accuse the police. The police began targeting all NGO
workers and journalists involved in the initial rescue and publicity efforts and formally
named several as suspects. They did not proceed with any investigation into
the deaths of the three men in South Aceh.
On April 11, President Wahid issued President Instruction (Inpres) No. 4,which
effectively authorized increased police-military operations in Aceh. The instruction
was issued following the closure of Exxon-Mobil gasfields in North Aceh
because of security threats.The decree was roundly denounced in Aceh and the call
for its revocation became a rallying cry for political activists province-wide.
Even before Inpres No.4 was issued, the security forces made a practice of retaliatory
burnings of houses and shops to punish GAM attacks. On February 28, 2001,
GAM took control briefly of the town of Idi Rayeuk in East Aceh. After military
forces retook the town of 15,000, they burned it to the ground, causing massive displacement.
Similar arson attacks took place throughout the year, despite the fact
that on May 22, Brig. Gen. Zamroni, the commander of military operations in
Aceh, formally forbade the practice.
In June, an eruption of violence in central Aceh led to hundreds of civilian
deaths. It started with a GAM attack on the night of June 5-6 on Javanese settlers,
killing more than forty. The next days and weeks saw a ferocious counterattack by
the military working in collaboration with a local militia. By early July some 150
people had been confirmed dead by the Indonesian Red Cross and more than eight
hundred houses had been burned to the ground.
On August 9, a massacre of thirty-one Acehnese workers took place on the Bumi
Flora palm oil plantation in Julok, East Aceh.While both sides blamed each other
for the killing, the evidence accumulated by late September suggested that Indonesian
security forces were responsible and were intimidating potential witnesses.
Reports by fact-finding teams sent by the district government and Komnas-HAM
had not been made public by late 2001.
In addition to the killings noted above, several high-profile murders took place
that remained unsolved by the end of November. On May 10, 2001,Major General
(ret.) Haji Djohan, local leader of Golkar, the former ruling party, was gunned
down outside his home in Banda Aceh. On September 1, Zaini Sulaiman, a member
of the provincial parliament representing the United Development Party
(known as PPP) was slain in front of his home by unidentified armed men. On September
6, Dayan Dawood, the rector of Banda Aceh’s Syiah Kuala University, was
killed as he was driving home from work in an official car. Neither side acknowledged
responsibility for the killings.
Local parliamentarians faced threats from both sides. A legislator from East
Aceh, Ghazali Usman, was abducted by GAM after having been named a member
of the government fact-finding team looking into the Julok massacre. He had not been released by early November. Schoolteachers were also targeted. The Indonesian
teachers’ association noted in September that 135 of its members had been victims
of violence in Aceh over the previous two years.Dozens of elementary schools
were burned down during the year.
Banda Aceh’s main newspaper, Serambi Indonesia, was forced to close twice during
the year because of GAM threats, once in June and once in August.
Efforts at dialogue proved fruitless. Negotiations between the Indonesian government
and GAM, facilitated by the Geneva-based Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue,
foundered on mutual lack of trust and effectively broke down in early July
when. Indonesia unilaterally withdrew from a security monitoring team. Later that
month, police in Banda Aceh arrested six GAM negotiators despite government
guarantees of their security. Five of the negotiators were conditionally released on
August 29 but the charges against them were not dropped; one continued to be held
as of October on the grounds that he held a false passport. New talks were scheduled
for early November, but GAM refused to participate unless the Indonesian
government dropped its case against the negotiators.
President Megawati signed a law giving autonomy to Aceh on August 11 and
made that implementation of that law the centerpiece of her Aceh policy. But the
law, changing the name of the province to Nanggroe Aceh Daroessalam (NAD), did
not appear to have widespread support, especially as there was little consultation in
Aceh before it was passed.
Papua
Conditions in Papua also continued to worsen. Although the Indonesian government
made important political overtures, including a promise of substantial
autonomy, to Papuan leaders in response to an all-Papua congress in June 2000, it
also returned to a hardline approach.
In late 2000 and throughout 2001, Indonesian security forces intimidated and at
times attacked civilians in areas where rebels of the Free Papua Movement (Organisasi
Papua Merdeka or OPM) were believed to be active. They at times used indiscriminate
or excessive force against pro-independence demonstrators: two
Papuans were killed in Fakfak on December 1, 2000, eight in Merauke on December
2, and four in the highland town of Tiom on December 16, all during clashes
between pro-independence demonstrators and security forces. Authorities also
increased surveillance and harassment of prominent civil society leaders and
banned peaceful pro-independence expression. Several activists were put on trial in
Wamena, Jayapura, and Jakarta, many of them under the same “spreading hatred”
laws used in Aceh.
One of the most highly publicized incidents took place in Abepura, near the
provincial capital, on December 7, 2000. After two police officers and a security
guard were killed in an early morning raid apparently carried out by pro-independence
Papuan highlanders, police retaliated by rounding up scores of sleeping
students (mostly highlanders) and other Papuans, beating and torturing many of
them for much of the next thirty-six hours. One student was shot and killed, two
more died as a result of beatings, and dozens sustained serious injuries. The case became the subject of a high profile investigation that led investigators to issue a
hard-hitting report naming twenty-six police officers as suspects, but no charges
were filed and the future of the prosecution remained in doubt as of mid-November
2001.
The worst violence occurred in the Wasior area ofManokwari district, triggered
by the murder on April 6 of three plantation workers. Plantation officials claimed
the perpetrators were rebels. Security forces responded by launching violent
“sweeps” or raids in nearby villages which, according to local rights monitors, left
six civilians dead by mid-May. On June 13, five police officers and a logging company
employee were killed in an attack police blamed on the rebels, prompting
renewed sweeps. By mid-November, there had been dozens of new arrests, several
reports of torture, and thousands of people in the region had fled their homes fearing
retaliation. Local monitors in November also reported security crackdowns in
Ilaga and near Timika following clashes between rebels and security forces.
The Indonesian parliament passed the Papuan autonomy bill on October 23,
giving Papuans a greater say in provincial government and allowing provincial
authorities to retain 80 percent of local forestry and fishery revenues and 70 percent
of oil, gas, and mining revenues. Papuan political leaders, however, continued
to demand independence. On November 10, Theys Eluay, a leading Papuan independence
leader was abducted and killed outside Jayapura; his family blamed security
forces, as international and domestic organizations called for an independent
inquiry.
Central Kalimantan
An eruption of violence in Central Kalimantan in February 2001 around the
logging port of Sampit, Kotawaringin Timur district, led to indigenous Dayaks
killing some five hundred immigrants from the island of Madura, off the coast of
East Java, and displacing more than 150,000 people.Many of the killings involved
decapitation, and little distinction was made between men, women, and children.
The outbreak had complex roots but appeared to be linked to longstanding economic
and social grievances of the Dayaks, competition over local resources, and
new opportunities for political mobilization along ethnic lines.Muhamad Usop, a
Dayak leader who sought the Central Kalimantan governorship, was arrested on
May 4 and held briefly on incitement charges.
As elsewhere in Indonesia, police proved incapable of halting the violence, and
the army was sent in, further poisoning relations between the police and army.
Maluku
Christian-Muslim violence continued to erupt sporadically in the Moluccas.
The government made no effort to remove Laskar Jihad, the Java-based Muslim
militia that arrived in the province by the thousands in 2000. Its members continued
to be responsible for human rights violations. In early 2001, evidence emerged
of Laskar Jihad forcing several hundred Christians from Teor,Ceram and the island
of Kesui to convert to Islam and circumcising men and women alike.On May 4, the Wahid government finally took action against the head of Laskar Jihad, Jafar Umar
Thalib, but not for any of his actions as commander of a private army. Instead, he
was charged with murder for sentencing one of his followers to execution by stoning
and having a crowd proceed to kill the confessed adulterer. The arrest appeared
to prompt a new wave of violence that killed eighteen Christians by the end ofMay.
On June 14, a botched raid by an army battalion on a Laskar Jihad post left twentytwo
Muslims dead. On August 8,Megawati’s vice-president, Hamzah Haz, made a
point of meeting with Jafar Umar Thalib and Laskar Jihad members. While he
urged them to abide by the constitution, the meeting gave the group new legitimacy.
In June, Alex Manuputty, the Christian militia leader and founder of the Front
for Maluku Sovereignty, was arrested on charges of rebellion.He was sentenced to
four months in November.
East and West Timor
No one was brought to justice by November for the 1999 crimes in East Timor.
Half-hearted efforts by the attorney general’s office during the year to set up an ad
hoc tribunal to try people originally named in September 2000 as suspected perpetrators
of serious crimes came to nothing. The tribunal needed a recommendation
from the parliament to the president and then a presidential instruction. When
President Wahid finally issued the instruction in April, it only allowed for prosecution
of crimes occurring after the August 30, 1999 referendum. After protests, the
instruction was returned to the Ministry of Justice for rewriting. The reworded
decree was issued in August by President Megawati in one of her first acts after taking
office, but it remained flawed, as it only allowed for prosecution of two cases
from before August 30, 1999, that the attorney general’s office had deemed a priority.
It thus weakened the possibility of examining the whole pattern of state policy
that would be critical to establishing a crimes against humanity case.
In the meantime, the six alleged killers of the three United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) workers,murdered in Atambua,West Timor, on
September 6, 2000 were brought to trial in January 2001. On May 4, they were sentenced
to prison terms ranging from ten to twenty months. They had only been
accused of assault, apparently at the direction of the man who became Megawati’s
attorney general, M.A. Rahman, but even that charge could have resulted in a
twelve-year sentence. The leniency of the sentences was widely condemned internationally.
Eurico Gutteres, the East Timorese militia leader responsible for much of the
1999 violence in the city of Dili, was charged in relation to another incident in
Atambua that took place on September 24, 2000 shortly after the UNHCR killings.
Accused of incitement for resisting efforts of authorities to disarm the militias, he
was sentenced to six months in prison by the North Jakarta district court on April
30, 2001, but, credited with time spent under house arrest, he served only twentythree
days before being released.
Little progress was made toward addressing the 1999 violence in East Timor.As
of September, some 50,000 East Timorese remained in West Timor. A June 6, 2001 registration of that population conducted by the Indonesian government found
that 98.2 percent wished to stay in Indonesia, but it was unclear to what extent the
refugees had access to relevant information and felt able to answer freely. Only the
views of “heads of households”—usually men—were surveyed. Many refugees
were expected to return in the aftermath of the peaceful election in East Timor on
August 30.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
At least seven human rights defenders were killed in Aceh between November
2000 and October 2001, including the three RATA workers mentioned above.
Muhamad Efendi Malikon, thirty-five, secretary of a human rights organization
called Care Forum for Human Rights—East Aceh (Forum Peduli HAM-Aceh
Timur) was killed on February 28 in Peukan Langsa village, Langsa Timur subdistrict,
East Aceh.His body was found shortly after the vehicle in which he was riding
was stopped at a checkpoint by the paramilitary police, Brimob.At the time, he was
carrying a substantial amount of money to turn over to widows whose husbands
had been the victims of human rights violations in 1991.
Suprin Sulaiman, a lawyer with Koalisi-HAM in South Aceh, was killed on
March 29 after accompanying his client to an interrogation session by police. (See
above.)
Yusuf Usman, another member of Forum-Peduli HAM-Aceh Timor, was killed
on September 8. Jafar Syehdo, fifty-seven, a volunteer with the Indonesian Red
Cross (Palang Merah Indonesia, PMI) was found shot to death on October 3 in
Bireun. The PMI is the only humanitarian organization with a province-wide field
operation; among its tasks is the recovery of bodies of victims of the conflict.
No progress was made in the investigation of the death of Jafar Siddiq Hamzah,
human rights lawyer and founder of the International Forum on Aceh, whose
stabbed body was found north of Medan,North Sumatra in September 2000.
Acehnese human rights monitors trying to investigate abuses were routinely
hampered by the security forces, sometimes through short-term detention.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
International attention focused largely on the power struggle over the presidency,
the economy, the transition to democracy, and regional conflicts. Donors
continued to express frustration, often publicly, at Indonesia’s failure to make
headway in bringing human rights abusers to justice, particularly in relation to the
1999 violence in East Timor and the September 2000 killing of the three UNHCR
workers.
The resumption of military aid to Indonesia was a major issue for many donors
and their respective publics. In August, the Jakarta Post announced that the United
Kingdom (U.K.) would resume arms sales to Indonesia, quoting U.K. Foreign
Office Minister Ben Bradshaw as saying Britain had accepted Indonesian army assurances that the arms would not be used for internal repression. The U.S. also
decided to “re-engage” the army, without, however, resuming sales of lethal
weapons.
United Nations
The U.N. Security Council continued to be concerned about Indonesia’s failure
to make any progress toward accountability for the 1999 violence in East Timor and
the situation of East Timorese refugees in West Timor. In a visit to Jakarta in mid-
November 2000, a Security Council delegation stressed the need for speedy resolution
of the refugee problem and progress in bringing human rights abusers to trial.
On May 4, Secretary-General Kofi Annan took the unusual step of issuing a statement
expressing outrage at the light sentences handed down by a Jakarta court
against the killers of the UNHCR workers.
The U.N.’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)
continued to be active in Indonesia. On February 27, it sent two missions to Kalimantan
to look into the impact of the Dayak-Madurese violence, particularly as
it related to the internally displaced. In late August, OCHA opened a small office
in Aceh to coordinate humanitarian aid, and it continued to be active in the
Moluccas.
In late 2000, the United Nations Development Program launched a program
called “Partnership for Governance Reform” through which it coordinated aid programs
from several donors in efforts to strengthen democracy and civil society.
Program areas included strengthening of parliamentary institutions; electoral
reform; civil society participation; legal and judicial reform; anti-corruption
efforts; decentralization and civil society reform; and police reform. The Asian
Development Bank,World Bank, and several bilateral donors including the Netherlands
and Nordic countries were among the initial donors.
On November 22, 2000, five U.N. human rights experts issued a joint statement
of concern about the deteriorating situation in Aceh. Francis Deng, the U.N. special
rapporteur for internally displaced persons, visited Indonesia during the last week
in September.
Indonesia presented its first report to the Committee against Torture in November
2001; in doing so, it announced that it would ratify the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social,
and Cultural Rights by the end of the year.
European Union
The E.U. continued actively to strengthen relations with Indonesia, while also
exploring ways to resolve regional conflicts. On December 13, 2000, in response to
a proposal from the European Commission to develop closer relations with
Indonesia, the European Parliament expressed concern about factors undermining
democratization in Indonesia, including lack of accountability for human rights
abuses, the continued role of the armed forces in government, and the ongoing
conflicts in the Moluccas, Aceh, and Papua. It supported further aid for Indonesia as long as attempts were made to resolve those conflicts, human rights were substantially
improved, and the corruption problem was addressed.
In May, the E.U. echoed Kofi Annan’s protest over the light sentences given
the six men found guilty of the deaths of the UNHCR workers. In a statement
issued on May 10, the E.U. welcomed the Indonesian attorney-general’s declared
intent to appeal the sentences and pointedly recalled Indonesia’s earlier commitment
to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights that the trials of the
suspects be conducted in conformity with international standards of justice and
fairness.”
The E.U. repeatedly called on Indonesia during the year to implement Security
Council Resolution 1319 with regard to disarming the militias in West Timor and
facilitating the return of East Timorese there.
United States
Both Congress and the Clinton administration condemned the murders of the
UNHCR workers in West Timor, and urged the indictment of senior military officials
responsible for the violence in 1999. Accountability in general remained high
on the agenda of the U.S. embassy in Jakarta.
The U.S. was actively engaged in supporting dialogue and strengthening civil
society in Aceh. In March, the State Department denied reports in the Indonesian
press that the U.S. was backing an Indonesian military offensive in order to secure
the Exxon-Mobil gasfields, saying that it was instead urging restraint and a “comprehensive
political solution.” U.S. diplomats repeatedly reiterated their support
for Indonesia’s territorial integrity.
Megawati Sukarnoputri became the first head of state to visit the U.S. in the
aftermath of the September 11 attacks in New York and Washington. Rather than
cancel the long-planned visit, the Bush administration used it to secure Indonesia’s
cooperation in opposing global terrorism. The administration had earlier decided
to expand contacts with the TNI, lifting some of the sanctions that had been in
place since the East Timor violence in 1999, including a ban on non-lethal commercial
arms sales, and used the visit to announce this.Restrictions on foreign military
sales (FMS),U.S.-government financed arms sales, and international military
education and training (IMET) programs remained in place in accordance with
provisions of the so-called Leahy Amendment.
The U.S. also promised bilateral assistance for judicial reform and carried out
some limited police training in areas such as crowd control and counternarcotics
efforts.The U.S. Export-Import bank gave a U.S. $3.2 million credit to Indonesia in
May for police equipment for forensics work.
Indonesia’s failure to curb threats against Americans by radical Islamic groups
following September 11 led to U.S. protests that its citizens and interests were not
being sufficiently protected.
Japan
Japan quietly urged President Wahid to move forward with setting up the ad hoc tribunal on East Timor.While not objecting to military operations in Aceh, Japanese
officials urged both Indonesian security forces and GAM to exercise restraint.
Japan continued to be Indonesia’s largest donor. Its aid programs included some
training in community-based policing.
President Megawati visited Japan in September and met with Prime Minister
Junichiro Koizumi. The two leaders expressed opposition to terrorism. Megawati
asked for Japanese aid and private investment; she also sought rescheduling of
Indonesia’s debt (more than $2.7 billion) to Japan. Koizumi agreed to consider her
requests in advance of the donor conference in November.
Australia
Relations with Indonesia, seriously strained by Australia’s role in the East Timor
crisis in 1999, improved somewhat with the visit to Canberra by President Wahid
in late June 2001—the first visit by an Indonesian president in twenty-six years.
According to press reports, he assured Prime Minister John Howard that prosecutions
would take place for serious crimes committed in East Timor in 1999.
Prime Minister Howard became the first head of state to visit President
Megawati after her accession to the presidency in July. On his return to Australia,
Howard declared that the two countries had put their differences over East Timor
behind them.
Relations quickly became strained again in August, however, over the issue of
asylum-seekers and undocumented migrants seeking to enter Australia from
Indonesian waters. Indonesia is not a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention.
International Financial Institutions
In February, the World Bank launched a new three-year country assistance strategy
for Indonesia, criticizing the high level of debt and corruption. It announced
that it would lend only $492.7 million for fiscal year 2001, down from the average
of $1.3 billion annually from 1990-1997.The bank also urged adoption of an agreement
with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that would allow disbursement
of a $400 million loan held up since late 2000. The loan was eventually disbursed
on September 10, 2001.
President Megawati met with World Bank President James Wolfensohn in September;
he stressed the need for progress on legal and judicial reform before the
bank could consider increasing its lending.
