YEMEN
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
The security forces continued to exercise wide powers and to commit abuses,
including arbitrary arrest, torture, and killings of civilians with virtual impunity.
The press came under increasing pressure and the number of executions increased.
Early in the year, unknown persons set off a series of bomb explosions in Aden and
al-Dhali’ province in the south, and kidnapping of both Yemenis and foreigners
remained a major security issue.
A nationwide referendum in February 2001, approved constitutional amendments
that strengthened the position of President Ali Abdallah Salih and his ruling
General People’s Congress (GPC).The parliamentary term was increased from four
to six years and the president’s right to decree laws when parliament was in recess
was abolished but the amendments lengthened the presidential term from five to
seven years, and authorized the president to appoint a 111-member Consultative
Council. Opposition activists expressed concern that this body would allow the
president to offset the role of the elected parliament, thus augmenting indirect
executive control over legislation.
Local council elections held at the same time as the referendum,were marred by
violence and opposition charges that voter registration lists had been rigged.Unofficial
sources reported that some forty persons died and more than a hundred were
injured in clashes with security forces and among supporters of different parties on
election day and in its aftermath; the government said eleven persons were killed
and twenty-three were injured. In one incident reported in the Yemen Times, security
and military forces responded to a vote-counting dispute between the GPC and
the Islah party representatives by opening fire indiscriminately, using heavy and
medium-caliber weapons, in villages in Ibb governorate.Local people returned fire,
which continued for more than three hours. Six persons died, seven were wounded
and thirty-five arrested. Due to disputes over irregularities in at least twenty percent
of the poll centers, final results were never officially announced. The General
People’s Congress claimed a comfortable majority in the councils, but opposition
leaders charged that the authorities had tampered with the results of both the referendum
and the local council elections.
Security forces attached to Central Security, under control of the Ministry of
Interior, and the Political Security Office (PSO) which reports directly to President
Salih, committed abuses with virtual impunity. In July,Abdallah Salih al-Maitami,
an unsuccessful independent candidate in the Ibb local council elections, was summoned
by Central Security, beaten, shackled, and had his head forcibly shaved.Two
days after his arrest, on July 7, government forces entered the old city of Ibb,
detained thirty-five persons apparently at random, searched nine houses without
warrants, and demolished the Maitami family’s house. At least fourteen of those
detained were later released, eleven were held without charges as of this writing. In August, al-Maitami and two others were brought to trial on charges of assault
against security officials. They were on trial in November 2001 and incarcerated at
Ibb central prison, where they were kept together with convicted criminals; al-
Maitami was subject to further mistreatment.
In October, the PSO detained Abd al-Salam Nur ad-Din Hamad and Ahmad
Saif, two visiting academics affiliated to the Centre for Red Sea Studies at Exeter
University in the United Kingdom.During the two-day detention, they were blindfolded
and beaten while being interrogated about “spying for foreign powers, and
maintaining a relationship with Osama bin Laden, Israel and the separatists,” the
latter referring to the 1994 southern Yemeni effort to declare an independent state.
Yemeni officials denied that they were ill-treated and justified the detentions as one
of their “preventive measures” following the September 11 attacks in the U.S.
Police and security forces detained suspected members of radical Islamist
groups throughout the year; thirty-five were arrested in December, another thirteen
in January, and fifteen in June. Further arrests were carried out in the aftermath
of the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington, and by late
October, the Yemen Times reported, several hundred “Afghan Arabs”(Islamists who
had returned after spending time in Afghanistan) had been picked up for questioning
in Sana’a, Taizz, and Aden. Many were reportedly released within days,
however. At least eight suspects in the October 2000 attack on the USS Cole were
still held without charge in November, most of whom had been held well beyond
the maximum six-month period permitted under the criminal code of procedure.
Despite the general climate of impunity, three police officers of the Criminal
Investigation Department, Aqil al-Maqtari, Yahya al-Rub’, and Husain Ghanima,
were convicted in November 2000 in connection with the death in custody of
Sulaiman Salih in al-Hudaida. They received three-year prison terms and were
stripped of their rank and dismissed; relatives of the deceased lodged an appeal
seeking to have the sentences increased. In July, eight members of the Central Security
in al-Dhali’ province were charged with the premeditated murder of Hamdi
Salih Husain of the opposition Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP); the trial was pending
at this writing.
The press came under increased government pressure as the authorities
harassed journalists and embroiled opposition and independent newspapers in
court battles. In April, the Ministry of Information confiscated the first issue of
Huquq al-Insan (Human Rights), the monthly publication of “The Activists” (alnushata’)
human rights group ostensibly because the group had filed registration
documents one week prior to publication rather than the ten days required by the
press law. Yemen Times journalist Hasan al-Za’idi was detained by the PSO in both
June and September, each time for about fourteen days, reportedly for being a distant
relative of Al Za’idi tribesmen who had been involved in the kidnapping of two
foreigners.No charges were filed against him.
In June 2001, the prosecution office implemented parts of a 1997 judgment
passed against the opposition weekly al-Shura and its former editors, and suspended
the paper for six months. The paper continued publication under a new
license and name, but another defamation case was pending at this writing.
Defamation, which is loosely defined under Yemeni press law, was the most frequent
charge levied against independent and opposition papers, both by the government and by private citizens; by November, cases were pending against al-
Ayyam, Sawt al-Shura, al-Umma, al-Ra’i al-’Amm, al-Wahdawi, al-Shumu’ and as-
Sahwa. The press also came under attack for “inaccurate reporting.” In September,
the editor of Aden-based al-Haqiqa, Faris al-Yafi’i, was sentenced to a three-month
jail term and a fine of YR 5000 (U.S. $30) for “insulting an official” after he incorrectly
reported that the governor of Aden was about to resign.
The government took action against members of the opposition Yemeni Socialist
Party in al-Dhali’ province, arresting members of YSP-affiliated “popular committees”
after they mounted a peaceful demonstration against police and military
abuses in October 2000, but did not implement its threat,made in 2000, to dissolve
the party. Some YSP-affiliated journalists and military who had lived in exile since
1994 returned to the country and President Salih reportedly ordered the YSP headquarters
in Ma’alla in the city of Aden to be returned to the party. Those detained
in al-Dhali’ by Central Security and the PSO included YSP member Fadl al-Ja’adi
and journalists Ahmad Harmal and Muhammad Ali Muhsin: all three were
detained in November 2000, the first two for more than three weeks on incitement
charges. Authorities prevented access to lawyers during interrogation and denied
family visits.
A new law of associations took effect in February 2001, empowering the Ministry
of Labor and Social Affairs to supervise nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs). Registration was considered valid by default if the ministry failed to
process an application within one month. NGOs were allowed to receive foreign
funds upon notification of the ministry, and foreign-funded activities needed
explicit approval. A minimum of forty-one members was required to establish an
association. Penalties for violating any of the law’s provisions entailed prison sentences
of up to one year and penalties up to YR 100,000 (U.S. $600).
The government restricted access to the Internet indirectly by monopolizing
service and keeping prices prohibitively high. As in previous years, mobile phones
and pagers were rendered inoperable before major occasions like national holidays.
The media reported seventy-three executions for premeditated murder between
March 2001 and mid-October 2001, compared to fifty-two from mid-1998 to early
2001. A large number of other offenses carried the death penalty, among them
armed banditry, apostasy, rape, and treason.
Women continued to face discrimination in personal status law. Only a male
guardian could contract marriage for women who had no way to give meaningful
consent. In October 2001, the cabinet referred to the parliament an amendment to
the personal status law proposed by the governmental Women’s National Committee
to introduce a minimum age—eighteen years—for marriage. However, by
November the proposal, which lacked effective safeguards to protect women from
underage, forced, and polygamous marriage, had not been passed by the parliament.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Local human rights groups conducted training and awareness raising workshops
and lobbied successfully to remove some of the restrictions in the draft law on associations. Local chapters of Amnesty International operated in the major
cities.The government did not respond to reports of human rights violations monitored
by local groups.
The Women’s Affairs Support Center, a women’s rights group, ran workshops on
violence against women, media training, and other issues, and helped train local
rights activists. The Human Rights Information and Training Center and the Arabic
Sisters Forum also addressed issues related to the treatment of women by police
and in prison.
Four governmental human rights bodies—the Ministry for Human Rights, the
Supreme National Committee for Human Rights, and the human rights committees
of the Consultative Council and parliament—continued to operate. In early
October 2001, the parliamentary body, the Committee for General Liberties, published
a report criticizing the use of pre-trial detention by the CID and prison overcrowding.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United States
Relations between Yemen and the United States remained strained in the aftermath
of the October 2000 attack on the USS Cole in Aden harbor. The U.S. Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reportedly wished to interview certain high-ranking
Yemenis but President Salih told the Qatar-based al-Jazeera satellite television station
on September 5 that “Yemen will not permit the Americans to interrogate any
Yemeni citizens, whatever his capacity.” The trial of eight persons arrested in connection
with the USS Cole attack continued to be postponed, reportedly at Washington’s
request.
Following the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York and Washington, however,
U.S. law enforcement sources reported that Yemen’s cooperation with U.S.
investigations had improved.
U.S. economic assistance to Yemen increased from none in fiscal year (FY) 2000
to almost U.S. $4 million in FY 2001 and $5 million in FY 2002. Expenditures on
training programs for Yemeni military officers in the U.S. doubled to $250,000 in
FY 2002. In its presentation to Congress requesting these funds, the State Department
characterized Yemen as “at the forefront of the Arab world in both democratic
and economic reform” and said the country had “taken significant strides toward
opening its multiparty political system to full public participation, including
women.” The State Department’s annual human rights country reports for 2000
stated that Yemen’s human rights record “continued to improve”but that problems
such as torture and arbitrary detention remained.“There are significant limitations
on citizens’ ability to change their government,” the report said.
