ALGERIA
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
More than 1,500 people were killed in a tenth successive year of endemic political
violence involving the security forces and armed groups claiming to be Islamist.
The casualty level, although down from the mid-1990s, refuted official claims that
the violence was “residual.”As well as security force members and militants killed
in clashes and ambushes, the casualties included hundreds of civilians who were
indiscriminately attacked in their homes, at roadblocks, and in public places.
The year also saw the first mass popular protests since a state of emergency was
imposed in 1992. The protests were concentrated in the Berber-majority Kabylie
region. According to local nongovernmental organizations, over ninety civilians
died in the unrest, most of them victims of shootings by the security forces.
In the realm of public freedoms, Algeria presented a mixed picture. Massive
anti-government demonstrations were sometimes permitted, at other times forbidden
or aggressively broken up.Revisions to the penal code threatened press freedom,
yet private newspapers continued to criticize President Abdelaziz Bouteflika
daily.
Sweeping impunity prevailed for the perpetrators of massive human rights violations
on all sides of a conflict that has claimed well over 100,000 lives.
The 1999 “Civil Harmony” law offering amnesty or leniency to surrendering
militants, known as repentis, failed to end the political violence. There were apparently
few new surrenders in response to President Bouteflika’s suggestion in February
that the amnesty offer was still available even though the deadline specified in
the law had passed. In June, the level of violence increased and spread to regions
that had been relatively spared in recent years.
Much of the violence was blamed on two armed groups that had rejected the
amnesty, the Armed Islamic Group (Groupe islamique armé, GIA) and the Salafist
Group for Preaching and Combat. According to the often-sketchy available information,
the GIA slaughtered civilians indiscriminately and systematically while the
Salafist Group frequently targeted members of the security forces and governmentbacked
militias, but also killed civilians.Attribution was often difficult because the
assailants usually fled without being apprehended and rarely claimed responsibility
or explained their motives.
The governorates (wilayas) of Tipasa,Medea, Chlef, and Mascara were particularly
affected,while the Mitidja south of the capital suffered a resurgence of attacks.
On February 10, for example, an unidentified group of armed men gunned down
four families living in a shantytown near the city of Berrouaghia. Most of the
twenty-six killed were women and children. On August 12, in one of numerous
attacks committed by men who had set up roadblocks on intercity roads, seventeen
passengers were killed by armed men dressed in military uniforms in the wilaya of
Mascara. On September 26, attackers invaded a wedding party in the city of Larbaa, killing thirteen in attendance and nine others who happened to be in their path,
according to reports in Algerian private newspapers.The terror drove thousands of
Algerians toward more urban areas that offered relative safety but also social and
economic hardship.
A total of some 6,000 militants had applied for amnesty since the Civil Harmony
law went into effect in July 1999, according to government statements made during
2001. A de jure blanket amnesty was given to members of the two armed groups
that had formally agreed to disband in January 2000. Amnesty-seekers from other
groups were required to disclose their past deeds to government-controlled probation
committees. These bodies were charged with conducting investigations and
deciding whether applicants should be exempt from prosecution or, if they were
suspected of committing serious crimes, face reduced sentences.
In practice, the probation committees tended to exonerate repentis after a cursory
examination, according to victims’ rights groups. As a result, suspected assassins
were reportedly cleared to return home without punishment, even though the
Civil Harmony law states that persons who participated in killings or rape are disqualified
from receiving probation or reduced sentences.
Prime Minister Ali Benflis told European Parliament member Helène Flautre in
May that some four hundred surrendering militants were facing prosecution, but
this figure could not be independently verified. The committees operated behind
closed doors, and excluded victims, their survivors, and the public from their deliberations.
Even if accurate, the figure of four hundred prosecutions would represent
only 7 percent of the militants who were reported to have turned themselves in.
More than ninety Algerians were reported killed during street protests that
began on April 21 and continued sporadically for months. The demonstrations
were sparked by the death on April 20 of Berber high school student Guermah
Massinissa, who, two days earlier, had been shot while in custody in a gendarme
barracks. Local youths rejected gendarmerie claims that the shooting was accidental
and alleged that the gendarmes had increasingly harassed the local population
in the preceding months.
Many of the protests in the Kabylie were peaceful but in others, protesters threw
stones or Molotov cocktails at gendarmes, and damaged public buildings and property,
as well as private businesses. During the first and bloodiest week, gendarmes
repeatedly opened fire on protesters without warning, using live ammunition.They
also beat wounded persons and others not involved in the protests, according to
many eyewitnesses.
The demonstrators demanded, among other things, recognition of the Berber
language and cultural identity and the withdrawal of the gendarmes from the
region. In June, the street rallies spread to other regions, fueled by local grievances
over corruption, joblessness, and housing allocations.
On April 30, President Bouteflika announced an independent probe into the
events. On May 2, he named a respected jurist,Mohand Issad, to head it. The commission’s
interim report,made public three months later, contrasted favorably with
previous government-ordered inquiries that either were whitewashes or never
came out at all. The commission found that the gendarmes had “kept the pot boiling
by shooting live ammunition, ransacking, plundering, provocations of every sort, obscene language, and beatings.” It concluded that self-defense claims could
not justify the gendarmes’ fatal shooting of fifty civilians and the wounding of
another 218 by gunfire between April 22 and 28. During this period, it noted, one
security force member died, by electrocution, although many were injured.
The commission’s interim report did not identify gendarmes or officers responsible
for the excessive use of lethal force. Issad promised to resume the inquiry in
August, but further findings were unavailable as this report went to press.
Shortly after President Bouteflika’s address on April 30, security forces began
showing greater restraint in their use of live ammunition. Authorities also reassigned
many of the troops suspected of acting harshly, and deployed riot police
units who used teargas more than live bullets.
These factors helped to reduce casualties despite the larger and more widespread
nature of the protests during May and June. On May 21 and 31, huge demonstrations
were held, first in Tizi-Ouzou, then in Algiers. But on June 14, a Berber-dominated
march of about half a million people in the capital degenerated into looting
of shops and clashes involving the police, demonstrators, and local youth. Over
three hundred were injured and four killed. Many of the hundreds detained by
police were unaccounted for during several days; however, all were eventually
released.
On June 18, President Bouteflika banned all demonstrations in Algiers “until
further notice.” Police were deployed massively in the city and on roads leading
from the Kabylie to thwart would-be demonstrators. Pre-announced marches were
blocked in this manner on July 5,August 8, and October 5.
On October 3, Prime Minister Ali Benflis met with Berber community representatives
and announced that President Bouteflika had promised several initiatives.
These included amending the constitution to make the Berber language,
Tamazight, a national language; compensating victims of the disturbances; prosecuting
those responsible for crimes and killings during the clashes; and restructuring
the security forces in those areas of the Kabylie where abuses had taken place.
As of October, there was no verifiable information available about prosecutions of
security force members responsible for abuses during the protests, although there
were unconfirmed reports of arrests.
State-controlled television and radio remained government mouthpieces, usually
ignoring major demonstrations and massacres that were covered on locally
available European and Arab stations. Opposition politicians received little or no
television coverage except during the regularly broadcast sessions of parliament.
Private newspapers,by contrast,often criticized government actions,publishing
eyewitness accounts of the gendarmerie’s suppression of demonstrations, and
speculating openly about President Bouteflika’s future in office. However, they
exercised self-censorship concerning the army’s role in politics.
In June, El-Watan and el-Khabar became the first national dailies to print part
of their daily circulation at a private press, loosening the indirect editorial pressure
that accompanied the state’s near-monopoly on printing.However, revisions to the
penal code that took effect in July lengthened prison terms and increased fines for
defaming or insulting the president, state institutions, or officials. The amendments
were justified by officials as necessary to “preserve the dignity of the state and to protect individual and collective freedoms.”As this report went to press, no journalist
had yet been charged under the new amendments,which also curbed speech
in mosques by lengthening to five years the maximum sentence for delivering sermons
“capable of harming social cohesion.”
Entry visas for foreign reporters were sometimes approved, sometimes ignored
without explanation. Country specialists at the Paris dailies Libération and Le
Figaro were prevented from visiting during much of the year.
Internet use continued to grow as connection fees dropped and cybercafes proliferated.
There were no reports of sites being blocked, although the Internet regulations
required service providers to “constantly monitor the content available to
[their] subscribers to prevent access to . . . information contrary to the public order
or morality.” Early in 2001, police in the city of Boufarik ordered cybercafe operators
regularly to submit a log of their patrons’ names, and to report any activity that
seemed subversive or immoral.
No progress was achieved in locating or learning the fate of the thousands of
Algerians who had been forcibly “disappeared” by the security forces, primarily
between 1994 and 1996.Although there were no new cases of persons who had been
detained by security forces during 2001 and then remained missing for an extended
period, families came forward to report additional cases dating to the 1990s. The
National Association of Families of the Disappeared stated that its registry of documented
cases had surpassed 7,000.
In a speech on October 9, President Bouteflika asked families of the “disappeared”
to “trust the authorities” and to refrain from doing anything that “could
tarnish the image of the country or of Algerians.”
Government officials continued to provide statistics on cases the government
claimed to have “clarified,”while rarely if ever furnishing any useful information to
families. For example, according to a report issued in June by European Parliament
member Helène Flautre, Justice Minister Ahmed Ouyahia told Flautre in May that
out of 3,000 missing-person complaints received by the government, “a thousand
had been cleared up: 833 [of the missing persons] had joined the armed groups,
ninety-three had been killed, eighty-two were in detention, seventy-four had
returned home, and seven had benefited from the Civil Harmony [amnesty].”
However, the authorities furnished no evidence to families that particular missing
persons had joined armed groups. Few if any turned up among the thousands
of armed group members who had surrendered in recent years; nor did these
repentis provide information corroborating the government’s claim that many of
the supposedly “disappeared” had been alongside them in the mountains.
No headway was made in finding any of the several thousand Algerian civilians
said to have been abducted in previous years by armed groups. Few families learned
anything about relatives who had been abducted, despite the discovery in recent
years of several mass grave sites believed linked to the conflict, and the surrender of
thousands of militants, some of whom may have had knowledge of the abductions.
Security forces continued to torture detainees who were suspected of involvement
with or knowledge of the armed groups, according to human rights lawyers.
However, reports of torture declined along with the number of security-related
arrests compared with previous years.
In February, ex-army officer Habib Souaïdia published in Paris La Sale Guerre
(The Dirty War), the most detailed indictment yet of the army’s conduct. Souaïdia
detailed a pattern of torture and of summary executions practiced by anti-terrorist
units on suspected Islamists, and other abuses that he claimed to have witnessed
between 1993 and 1995.Algerian officials dismissed La Sale Guerre as part of a campaign
to smear the government.
In another challenge to impunity, on April 25, a Paris judge opened an investigation
into complaints filed against Khaled Nezzar by Algerians now living abroad
who said that they, or their deceased relatives, had been tortured in the early 1990s
when Nezzar was minister of defense. Nezzar, in France for the publication of his
memoirs, cut short his visit and left the country that night by private plane.
In some trials, including politically sensitive ones, judges conducted the proceedings
with seriousness and impartiality, but others were tainted by irregularities.
In a one-day trial on April 12, Fouad Boulemia was convicted and sentenced to
death for the November 1999 killing of Abdelqader Hachani, at the time the preeminent
Front Islamique du Salut (FIS) leader who was at liberty. Boulemia told
the judge he had been tortured into signing a “confession” that he now repudiated,
but this claim was rejected by the court. Boulemia was questioned neither
by his own lawyer nor the prosecutor. Boulemia remained in prison as of this
writing.
In another case, journalist Faouzia Ababsa, managing editor of the French-language
daily l’Authentique, was convicted of defamation on July 11 even though she
had not been notified of the trial and was not present. She received a suspended sixmonth
prison sentence and a fine.
In their indiscriminate attacks on civilians, armed groups abducted and raped
girls and women, when they did not kill them on the spot.Women’s rights groups
decried the lack of support services for rape victims.
The more general problem of gender-based violence was dramatized by attacks
on women living alone carried out by mobs of men who were apparently unaffiliated
with armed groups. On the evening of July 13, more than one hundred men
set upon a neighborhood of the oil-rich city of Hassi Messaoud.While other residents
were spared, migrant women were pulled from their homes, beaten, clubbed,
stabbed, and raped. The assault lasted well into the night, even though security
forces monitor the city closely. On October 9, El-Watan reported that thirty-eight
of the men had been charged with assault, rape, or other offenses, and of those
charged twenty-nine were being held in pretrial detention. According to one version,
the assailants were local residents motivated by accusations that the women
practiced “loose morals.” Later in the month, groups of men in the eastern city of
Tebessa twice raided a neighborhood where women lived alone, assaulting three
women in one instance and ransacking homes in the other. Attackers who were
arrested by police claimed they were fighting “debauchery.”
The highly discriminatory Family Code of 1984 remained intact. On March 8,
international women’s day, President Bouteflika called the code “discriminatory”
and said some of its provisions ran counter to “the spirit of Islam.” But neither he
nor the National Assembly took any initiative to amend articles that favored men
in matters of marriage, divorce, inheritance, and child custody.
On October 9, Algeria ratified the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the
Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their
Destruction (Mine Ban Treaty). It will enter into force for Algeria on April 1, 2002.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Algerian human rights and victims’ rights organizations, lawyers, and certain
political parties collected information and lobbied in defense of rights. The main
obstacle to documenting abuses appeared to be the fear among victims and their
families to testify, particularly among rural populations hard-hit by political violence.
Police generally tolerated the regular sit-ins organized by families of the “disappeared”
in front of public buildings, but broke them up on occasion.An attempted
march by families in the city of Relizane on September 19 was blocked on the
grounds that it was unauthorized.
Mohamed Smaïn, a spokesperson of the Relizane bureau of the independent
Algerian League for the Defense of Human Rights, was detained on February 23
and held for two days in connection with a defamation suit filed by Hadj Fergane,
a former mayor and militia chief whom Smaïn had accused of involvement in kidnappings
and extrajudicial killings. Smaïn’s identification documents were seized
and he was prohibited from traveling without court authorization. On October 28,
with the case still pending, the gendarmerie cautioned Smaïn that the travel restriction
remained in effect. The confiscated documents had not been returned. In
November,however, Smaïn prevailed in another case in which a Relizane court sentenced
Fergane to six months in prison for defaming Smaïn.
The National Association of Families of the Disappeared remained active even
though its application for legal recognition had gone unanswered. In September,
another organization of families of the “disappeared,” SOS Disparus, opened a
national headquarters in downtown Algiers, the first office devoted solely to this
issue.
In contrast to 2000, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and the
International Federation for Human Rights were not permitted to conduct fieldwork
in Algeria during the first ten months of 2001.However, the French freedom
of expression organization Reporters sans Frontières visited in January to investigate
the cases of five missing Algerian journalists.
The government continued its refusal to grant long-standing mission requests
from the U.N. special rapporteurs on torture, and on extrajudicial, summary, or
arbitrary executions, and the Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances
(WGEID). The International Committee of the Red Cross conducted its
fourth and fifth rounds since 1999 of visits to prisons, including private interviews
with inmates. Its agreement with the authorities excluded visits to facilities run by
the ministries of interior or defense.
In March, authorities dissolved the nine-year-old National Human Rights
Observatory,which reported to the president and was viewed as ineffective by most
victims of government abuse who had sought its assistance. It was replaced in October by the National Consultative Commission for Promoting and Protecting
Human Rights.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
European Union
E.U. countries received 20 percent of their natural gas supplies from Algeria and
purchased 70 percent of Algeria’s total exports.
Negotiations continued over a bilateral association agreement between the E.U.
and Algeria, and the E.U. funded modest programs to support private newspapers
and to train the police in forensic science and in human rights.
On June 16, the European Council, composed of the heads of government of the
E.U. countries, publicly urged “all those responsible in Algeria” to “act to end the
present confrontations and violence,” and called on the government to “launch a
political initiative to overcome the crisis by means of dialogue among all Algerians.”
The statement pledged the E.U.’s support for “the political, economic, and social
reforms necessary for restoring peace, stability and prosperity.”
Human rights received some attention at the ministerial-level “troika”meetings
held in Algeria on April 24. (The troika consists of representatives of the current
E.U. presidency, the commission, and the High Representative for the Common
Foreign and Security Policy.) The Europeans presented a list of some thirty “disappeared”
cases and requested clarification.Anna Lindh, the foreign minister of Sweden
(at the time E.U. president), stated that the E.U. “takes a serious view” of
“disappearances,” arbitrary arrests, and torture. She also voiced concern about the
proposed penal code amendments restricting press freedom.
A resolution adopted January 18 by the European Parliament condemned all
forms of violence against civilians in Algeria and urged the government to cooperate
with the U.N. WGEID. A resolution adopted May 17 criticized the killing
of demonstrators and urged greater respect for Berber cultural and linguistic
rights. In his statement before the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, the E.U.
representative on March 29 urged Algeria to allow visits by U.N. human rights
rapporteurs.
France
France was Algeria’s leading source of imports and home to the largest Algerian
community outside of Algeria. French assistance to Algeria came mainly in the
form of credits for the purchase of French exports.
During the conflict that has raged in Algeria since 1992, France has been circumspect
on governmental human rights abuses committed against suspected
Islamists. In 2001, the French government spoke out more forcefully when the
security forces killed some fifty protesters in the Kabylie during the last week of
April.Kabyles (Berbers) constitute a large percentage of France’s Algerian community
and are politically well-organized.On May 2, Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine warned that France could not remain silent about “the violence and repression”and
urged “political dialogue.” On June 19, he said the demands by the Algerian people
for “real change” were “thoroughly legitimate.” In an interview published in Le
Monde of July 11, Vedrine scoffed at the accusation made by President Bouteflika
and others that foreign meddling had caused the recent disturbances: “The Algerian
regime knows very well that this is false, that this contestation is the result of
internal problems.”
On other human rights issues, France was more discreet.Vedrine, Interior Minister
Daniel Vaillant, and State Secretary Michelle Demessine all visited Algiers in
February and made no public statements regarding human rights at the time.
United States
Never a priority country in the region for the U.S.,Algeria received greater attention
during 2001. Human rights concerns were raised in bilateral meetings but
remained secondary to anti-terror cooperation, U.S. private investments, and
resolving the conflict over the Western Sahara.
These were among the topics discussed when President George W. Bush met
with President Bouteflika on July 12 in Washington. It was the first meeting
between heads of state since a military-backed coup in 1992 halted Algeria’s elections.
Bush reportedly urged Bouteflika to make progress on human rights, but the
White House did not comment publicly on the subject.
Relations had been gradually warming prior to the summit. In February in Germany,
Carlton W. Fulford, deputy commander of the American forces in Europe,
received General Mohamed Lamari, chief-of-staff of the Algerian army, which is
implicated in massive human rights abuses.
Following the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington, Algeria
shared with Washington a list of 350 Algerians abroad with alleged links to Osama
bin Laden, and a list of alleged Islamist militants inside Algeria, according to news
reports. The State Department and National Security Council (NSC) declined to
comment to Human Rights Watch on those reports.
U.S. interest in anti-terror cooperation was undoubtedly a factor in President
Bush’s receiving President Bouteflika again in Washington on November 5. The
U.S. made no public comments about what they discussed. But on November 9, an
NSC official told Human Rights Watch that Algeria had been asking the U.S.“to be
more forthcoming” on licensing private arms sales. He added that the U.S. was
maintaining its “go-slow” approach and had not changed its opposition to selling
night-vision equipment, an item Algeria has long sought for counter-insurgency
use.
Algeria received minimal direct aid from the U.S. However, the U.S. government-
run Export-Import bank,which provides loans and guarantees to assist U.S.
investment abroad, stated that its exposure in Algeria rose in the fiscal year ending
September 30 to nearly U.S. $2 billion, a level matched in the Middle East and
North Africa only by the bank’s exposure in Saudi Arabia. Total private U.S. investment
in Algeria was about U.S. $4 billion, nearly all in the energy sector.
In November 2000,Harold Koh, then-President Clinton’s assistant secretary for human rights, democracy, and labor,made his first trip to Algeria.During two days
he met with human rights activists and government officials. His public remarks
about local rights conditions were general and brief. In the year since Koh’s visit, the
U.S. government made no high-level public statements on human rights except for
the solid chapter on Algeria in the State Department’s Country Reports on Human
Rights Practices.
