GEORGIA
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
The Georgian government accepted United States (U.S.) military assistance and
pursued a pipeline project to transport Caspian oil and gas to western markets.
These initiatives accelerated Georgia’s shift toward strategic alignment with the
U.S. and Western Europe, and brought escalating tension with Russia.The U.S. and
Russia branded Georgia’s Pankisi Gorge—home to several thousand Chechen
refugees—a terrorist haven, respectively citing the presence there of al-Qaeda and
Chechen rebel fighters. The U.S. “Train and Equip” program to strengthen Georgia’s
counter-terrorism efforts in Pankisi got under way, but Georgia rebuffed Russia’s
repeated demands to conduct its own military operations in the area.
The government did not match its geostrategic repositioning with any significant
reform or improvement in its human rights record. Leading reformers left
the governing Citizens’ Union (CUG) and founded opposition parties, which
eclipsed the CUG in June local elections. The government issued a decree to crack
down on religious mob violence, and created a commission to devise reforms to
end corruption and abuses in law enforcement, and yet indulged such abuses in
practice.
In the context of the war on terrorism, international focus on the Pankisi Gorge
resulted from the Georgian government’s failure since 1999 to enforce the rule of
law there. Allegedly, officials from security and law enforcement agencies had
shared the profits from weapons and drug trafficking and kidnapping rings in the
region. The same agencies, under new leadership since November 2001, now took action in the Pankisi Gorge to gain and maintain U.S. assistance, and to stave off
Russian intervention.
Several thousand refugees who fled renewed armed conflict in Chechnya from
1999 lived in the Pankisi Gorge.To its credit, the government resisted pressure from
Russia to forcibly return them. Yet some of the measures it took in Pankisi in the
name of anti-terrorism were arbitrary or brutal. On March 22 the National Security
Ministry detained two Georgian ethnic Chechen activists who worked with
refugees in the gorge, Islam Saidaev and Zurab Khangoshvili, on suspicion of association
with al-Qaeda, based on no evidence other than the fact that they were the
only Georgian citizens to make the pilgrimage to Mecca in 2002. The ministry
secured their pre-trial detention for three months by falsifying the date of their
arrest, to avoid their compulsory release under habeas corpus deadlines.They were
released in June, but the investigation continued. On April 28 three men of Arab
origin “disappeared” after a uniformed military detachment detained them.Witnesses
reported that the troops handcuffed the men’s driver, Vizuri Khangoshvili,
shot him fatally in the stomach, and left him in a ditch. No criminal investigation
followed. On September 25 Chechen refugee Hussein Yussupov “disappeared”
while in Security Ministry detention.
For at least the first half of the year, reports persisted of official involvement in
criminality in the Pankisi Gorge.Against a background of allegations that weapons
were being illegally traded through the Pankisi Gorge to rebels in Chechnya, the
authorities showed little interest in interviewing or protecting Aiub Paikaev, a
Chechen arms trader who claimed that arms transfers were made under Ministry
of National Security patronage. Paikaev had collaborated with the investigative television
program 60 Minutes, which in March broadcast hidden camera footage of
a former Georgian army colonel negotiating with him a weapons purchase from a
Russian peacekeepers’ base in the breakaway Georgian region of South Ossetia.
Days later, unknown assailants beat Paikaev on the street in Tbilisi, the capital.
Police promptly arrested him for having wounded a passerby during the struggle.
At this writing Paikaev was in detention for attempting to flee the country with a
false passport.
Kidnappings continued. In December 2001 two Spanish businessmen held
hostage for more than a year in the Pankisi Gorge were released, after payment of
substantial ransoms. The media published allegations that senior Georgian law
enforcement officials had colluded with the kidnappers. After the June 2002 kidnapping
of British banker Peter Shaw, two government ministers acknowledged
that law enforcement agents were most likely responsible. As of mid-November
none of his kidnappers had been arrested in the wake of his November 6 escape.
Under public pressure to end the kidnap of the brother of a popular soccer player,
police used electric shocks to torture Badri Khundadze, an acquaintance of two suspects,
in a vain attempt to discover their whereabouts.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs in January introduced a telephone hotline for
torture complaints, but it did not appear to reduce the frequent occurrence of
police torture. The Ministry of Justice forensic bureau confirmed that the police
continued to use wind-up military field telephones as electric shock torture
devices. Beginning in January, the Ministry of Justice instituted systematic medical forensic monitoring of detainees transferred from police stations throughout eastern
Georgia to its Tbilisi pre-trial detention facility.This provided the first basis for
quantifying police torture and ill-treatment and violations of habeas corpus deadlines.
Despite these advances, impunity for police torture and extortion remained
widespread. Investigation into the death of Temur Mikia—a young man beaten and
thrown from an upstairs window of the Poti police station in July 2001—was
stalled, and the officers alleged to have killed him remained in their jobs. In June, 60
Minutes exposed corruption in the Ministry of Internal Affairs narcotics department,
but as of October a criminal investigation had not produced any results. The
program had shown hidden camera footage of the department chief instructing an
informant to plant narcotics on persons from whom bribes could be extorted.
On September 27 more than twenty police officers reportedly raided a local television
station in Zugdidi, beating staff and smashing equipment. The station had
cooperated with 60 Minutes on a report about police involvement in gasoline
smuggling from Abkhazia. On the same day, police allegedly mistreated the mother
and ten-year-old son of the program’s Zugdidi correspondent, Emma Gogokhia,
when they failed to find her at home. A group of neighbors reportedly prevented
police from taking the boy away.After an internal investigation the deputy regional
police chief was dismissed in November.
Law enforcement agencies and courts continued to afford de facto impunity to
groups of civilian militants who intimidated and assaulted members of non-
Orthodox religious faiths, particularly Jehovah’s Witnesses, Pentecostals, and Baptists.
The authorities did nothing to counter a growing campaign of vilification and
hostility against such faiths. In February a senior cleric of the Georgian Orthodox
Church called for members of religious “sects” to be killed. A member of parliament,
Guram Sharadze, mobilized a movement of supporters throughout the
country to pursue a range of ultranationalist causes by demonizing Jehovah’s Witnesses,
issuing a constant stream of bizarre and unfounded accusations against
them.
In January, Vasili Mkalavishvili, a defrocked Orthodox priest, and Petre
Ivanidze—responsible for organizing dozens of attacks on religious minorities in
and around Tbilisi since 1999—were at last brought to trial, but for just five attacks.
To date though, the trial disappointed hopes that justice would be served. Mkalavishvili’s
followers were allowed to dominate the courtroom and intimidate the
victims, primarily Jehovah’s Witnesses, who consequently feared attending subsequent
hearings, until security was improved in October. In February the authorities
had threatened to detain and forcibly bring victims to the trial, despite failing
to ensure courtroom security. The trial was repeatedly postponed and, at this writing,
proceedings on the merits had not commenced. In April a Tbilisi court lifted a
restraining order on Mkalavishvili even though he and his supporters had perpetrated
new attacks just prior to the trial and between hearings.
In one of their worst attacks, on December 23, 2001, Mkalavishvili and Ivanidze
led more than one hundred followers in an assault on the evangelical “Word of Life”
church, as it was meeting in central Tbilisi. The assailants beat people and stole
equipment,money, and personal documents.Although police arrived quickly, they
made no attempt to stop the beatings and thefts and made little attempt to investigate. On January 25 Mkalavishvili and supporters massed outside the Stereo 1 television
station, forcing it to withdraw an evangelical religious program, and on
February 3 they burned thousands of bibles and other religious books after breaking
into the Tbilisi warehouse of the United Bible Society. On July 1 Mkalavishvili’s
supporters were allowed to roam freely inside a Tbilisi police station and to assault
a Jehovah’s Witness and his son,whom they had falsely accused of throwing stones
at their church.
Local authorities pressured Jehovah’s Witnesses to cancel conventions scheduled
to take place in August in Kaspi and near Gori. There were anonymous nighttime
arson attacks on both convention sites, and on August 15 a mob raided the
sites, vandalizing and looting buildings, making bonfires of religious literature, and
badly beating a Jehovah’s Witness. Police and civilian militants maintained a joint
road blockade around Kaspi on August 16 to ensure the Jehovah’s Witnesses’ convention
there did not proceed.
In several instances priests of the Georgian Orthodox Church also harassed religious
minorities. On three successive days in early July two priests directed a crowd
that laid siege to a house in Tbilisi where the congregation of a Pentecostal church
was attempting to hold its regular service. On July 3 three carloads of men attacked
a group of Catholics near the town of Kvareli an hour after two priests had
demanded that the group leave the area. In September a priest in Sachkhere
received Patriarchate backing in preventing a deceased Jehovah’s Witness from
being buried next to her husband in the town cemetery. Near Ozurgeti, priests
allegedly exhorted a crowd to assault a breakaway Orthodox congregation that was
building an alternative village church. A crowd destroyed the church on October 6.
The Georgian government offered a draft law on religion as an unconvincing
remedy for religious violence.However, the draft provided for further discrimination
against religious minority groups through a restrictive registration regime and
a clause outlawing “improper proselytism.” Police throughout the country who
attended human rights seminars made clear that they expected the new law to give
them legal grounds to restrict such religious groups as the Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Against a background of growing poverty, and in contrast to its indulgence of
popular mobilization against religious minorities, the government did little to
encourage genuine participation in the political process.Registers used for the June
2 local elections were still uncomputerized and in a deplorable state, opening the
way for widespread fraud. Recounts of the Tbilisi vote were still unresolved in
November. The elections were strongly criticized by local and international monitors.
Human Rights Watch’s observation of polling in the town of Marneuli found
flagrant fraud, facilitated by low voter participation at most precincts.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
July saw one of the fiercest assaults on a nongovernmental human rights organization
(NGO) in Georgia since independence. On July 10 a group of about ten
attacked the Tbilisi office of the Liberty Institute, a Georgian human rights NGO
prominent in opposing religious intolerance. They severely beat its director, Levan Ramishvili, and other staff, and smashed computers, furniture, and other equipment.
The government consulted with NGOs in designing a law enforcement reform
program, but otherwise its attitude toward them grew less benign. In August the
chairman of the government’s audit chamber accused “certain NGOs and suspicious
entities”of “blasphemous and anti-orthodox intentions.”In a speech on April
24, President Eduard Shevardnadze implied that Georgian NGOs might be
financed by international terrorists. Such tactics were used to justify the need for a
law enabling government oversight of foreign grants to NGOs. Finance Minister
Zurab Noghadeili’s refusal to support this initiative is reported to have been a factor
in his dismissal in early May. On September 24 the new finance minister established
a unit to monitor foreign grants to Georgian NGOs.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
United Nations
Georgia was one of the few countries of the former Soviet Union to issue standing
invitations to U.N. human rights monitoring mechanisms. In March the U.N.
Human Rights Committee reviewed Georgia’s second periodic report. Chiefly, the
committee expressed concern at the large number of deaths in police and prison
custody, including from suicides and tuberculosis; widespread police torture; and
criminal procedure that facilitated arbitrary detention and prevented suspects
from filing a torture complaint with a court prior to trial. The committee set an
extraordinary twelve-month deadline for Georgia to report on measures taken to
rectify these abuses, including progress toward establishing an independent
authority to investigate all complaints of ill-treatment.
Although the committee expressed deep concern about the treatment of religious
minorities, it classified the violence against them merely as “harassment,”and
did not include it in the list of issues the Georgian government had to report on
within twelve months.
Council of Europe
A report by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) on its
May 2001 visit to Georgian detention facilities,published in July 2002, exposed how
loopholes both in the criminal procedure code, and in its implementation, facilitated
ill-treatment and torture. The committee also cited Tbilisi’s pre-trial facility
No. 5 for unacceptable dilapidation, failure to prevent the spread of tuberculosis,
and basement punishment cells that were uninhabitable. By September 2001 the
government had implemented the committee’s requirement that the facility’s basement
cells be de-commissioned.
During his April visit to Georgia the Lithuanian chairman of the Committee of
Ministers publicly took the government to task for its failure to end religious violence.
In April the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance published
its first report on Georgia, covering events up to June 2001. It blamed the authorities
for permitting religious violence to win significant public support, and specifically
criticized the Supreme Court’s February 2001 decision to annul the
registration of the Jehovah’s Witnesses as “an encouragement” for extremists “to
persevere in their attacks on religious minorities.”
The Directorate of Strategic Planning published a report on its December 2001
mission to Georgia. The report combined with other efforts by the Secretary General’s
office to promote electoral and criminal procedure reform, and to remind
Georgia of its obligation to provide for voluntary repatriation ofMeskhetian Turks,
deported from Georgia by Stalin in 1944.
Council of Europe observers made a strong statement expressing disappointment
at the chaotic conduct of the June 2 local elections, and judging them “unable
to provide for the basic conditions for electing genuine democratic local governments.”
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) observers stationed
along Georgia’s border with the Russian republics of Chechnya and
Ingushetia confirmed that Russia had bombed Georgian territory, in an August 23
raid that killed one and injured seven Georgian villagers
The OSCE Mission to Georgia sponsored a pilot torture prevention project in
Tbilisi, linking telephone hotlines in police stations to a rapid reaction group
formed by the ombudsman’s office.
European Union
The European Commission assigned Georgia Û1.9 million (U.S.$2 million)
within the framework of its revamped “European Initiative for Democracy and
Human Rights” program, and in September called for project proposals in a range
of thematic areas.
The commission’s vehement reaction to the December 2001 murder in Tbilisi of
Gunther Beuchel, its human rights project manager for Georgia, prompted the
government to establish a new police department for combating crime against foreigners.
United States
As part of its campaign against terrorism, the U.S. provided the Georgian military
with U.S.$64 million in assistance under the “Train and Equip” program to
support counter-terrorism operations in the Pankisi Gorge. As of October, at least
sixty U.S. troops were based in Georgia.
The U.S. government did not sufficiently question the arbitrary or brutal means
and methods used by Georgian security forces in detentions and operations in the
Pankisi Gorge. The U.S. failed to object to the detention on terrorism charges of Islam Saidaev and Zurab Khangoshvili, although the sole basis for their arrest was
information about their pilgrimage to Mecca, contained in a letter the U.S. embassy
sent to the Ministry of National Security. TIME Magazine reported that Georgian
forces carried out the April 28 illegal detention of three men and apparent extrajudicial
killing of a fourth on the basis of intelligence provided by the U.S. Neither
government refuted October reports that Georgia was extra-legally extraditing al-
Qaeda suspects to the U.S.
At worst, these acts of commission and omission undermined other U.S. activity
directed toward consolidating good human rights practices. At best, they
amounted to a lost opportunity, as security assistance to Georgia made the government
more sensitive to scrutiny by the U.S. of the situation. For example, criticism
in the State Department’s annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices
helped prompt a brief flurry of Georgian government activity, including a presidential
decree on human rights in May.
The U.S.Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe’s May 15 letter to
Shevardnadze, urging him to end religious violence, had a significant public
impact.The commission maintained pressure by holding a hearing on the problem
in September. To its credit, from mid-year the U.S. embassy in Tbilisi began making
vigorous statements urging the Georgian authorities to act against religious
violence, and to promote freedom of religion.
The State Department’s second Trafficking in Persons Report,published in June,
described Georgia as a country of origin and transit for women trafficked primarily
to Turkey and Greece, failing to mention that surveys revealed the U.S. as the
third most common trafficking destination. The report wrongly concluded that
Georgia had made significant efforts to combat trafficking in 2002, citing in support
government anti-trafficking initiatives that existed on paper only.
The U.S. Department of Justice provided valuable financial support for two
potential catalysts for positive change in the criminal justice system: the forensic
bureau of the Ministry of Justice and the secretariat of the presidential commission
for reform of law enforcement agencies.
Russian Federation
Beginning in February, the Russian government attempted to pressure Georgia
to forcibly return Chechen refugees living on Georgian territory, despite the likelihood
that they would face torture, “disappearance,” and other persecution if they
returned.
On several occasions through the year, aircraft emanating from and returning to
Russian airspace bombed Georgian territory. On August 23 one of these attacks
killed a villager south of the Pankisi Gorge and wounded seven others. In a statement
on September 11 Russian President Vladimir Putin cited an October 2001
U.N. Security Council resolution requiring states to deny safe haven to terrorists, in
justification of possible further military action against Georgia. The statement was
the boldest to date in Russia’s opportunistic endeavor to link the Russian operation
in Chechnya and the global fight against terrorism, and deflect international attention
from the political aspects of the Chechnya conflict.
