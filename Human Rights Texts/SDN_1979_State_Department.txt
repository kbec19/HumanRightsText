 SUDAN
 The year 1979 has been somewhat difficult for the Nimeiri
 Government. It has been faced with serious external problems,
 including pressure from much of the Arab world to withdraw
 its support for the Mid-East peace process, and with tense
 relations with its neighbors, Ethiopia and Uganda. The
 government has been plagued domestically by a seriously
 deteriorating economic situation and resultant labor unrest,
 civil disturbances, increasingly vocal criticism on the part
 of political opponents, and an anti-government conspiracy in
 April. A burdensome refugee problem, already stretching
 government services and economic resources to the breaking
 point, was intensified as refugees from the Ugandan fighting
 joined the hundreds of thousands from Eritrea already in
 Sudan, swelling the refugee population to more than a third
 of a million.
 The Sudanese Government generally responded to these diffi-
 culties with restraint and tolerance, although Communists
 and Baathists were dealt with sternly.  Several hundred Com-
 munists are still in prison following civil/labor dis-
 turbances in August. Trials have been set for several
 Baathists arrested at the same time.
 Nimeiri's efforts to achieve reconciliation with former
 political opponents made some progress. Members of the Ansar
 sect, exiled in Libya and Ethiopia since their participation
 in the 1970 and 1976 coup attempts, returned to Sudan in May,
 and most of the returnees are now resettled in western
 Sudan. Their leader, a long-time Nimeiri rival, returned to
 Sudan in June. Another major former political opponent was
 named Attorney General in a cabinet reshuffle which took
 place in August.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Several of those arrested in connection with the April
 conspiracy charged they had been tortured during their
 detention. The state security tribunal which tried them
 appeared to take these charges seriously and instituted an
 investigation, but reportedly found no evidence to support
 the allegations.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There are no reports of such treatment, although Sudanese
 prisons and other detention facilities reflect the acute
 poverty of the country.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Several hundred Communists are being held under "preventive
 detention" provisions in connection with the August disturb-
 ances. They have not yet been charged.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Other than during periods of political crisis, fair public
 
 
 197
 trials by civilian courts are the rule. In cases perceived
 to involve state security, special tribunals are set up.
 These were convened in 1979 to try the April conspirators, as
 well as certain persons charged with corruption and black
 market activities. With the exception of the conspiracy
 trial, these have been open and appear to be fair. Although
 the conspiracy trial was closed, regular reports of the
 proceedings were carried in the press.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 There are constitutional guarantees against invasion of the
 home and these are normally respected; during the April
 conspiracy scare, house-to-house searches without benefit of
 magistrates' warrants were reportedly conducted, however.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Government resources are severely limited and have been
 stretched even further by the refugee crisis. Last year
 emphasis was put on dealing with acute food shortages. For
 FY 79, 50 million pounds (roughly $100 million) of the
 President's discretionary fund was set aside to combat food
 shortages. Some of this money has been used to reduce
 the price of wheat. The new 1979-80 budget also contains some
 six million pounds ($12 million) per province to help finance
 the transport and distribution of basic food items.
 The government endeavors to provide free education and health
 services to the people and has invested in low cost housing
 programs for the poor. Considerable resources are being
 devoted to a primary health care project, designed to improve
 health care at the village level.
 Beginning in February 1979, the government launched a de-
 centralization effort, to make government services more
 responsive to the needs of the people by placing control of
 funds and implementation of projects at the province and
 local levels. This ambitious undertaking is beset by numer-
 ous personnel and funding problems, however. Allegations of
 corruption throughout the goverment are common, and minor
 officials have been publicly accused and brought to trial for
 this practice.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Although articles of the constitution concerning freedom of
 opinion remain suspended, there was some loosening of govern-
 ment control in these areas in 1979. The authorities tolerat-
 ed a great deal of criticism. Although strikes and demonstra-
 tions are illegal, the government generally handled them with
 restraint. There are indications of an attempt at greater
 Islamicization of Sudanese laws, but it appears unlikely that
 this will in any way limit religious freedom, which is
 respected.
 The government does not censor the press, but the most impor-
 tant media are owned by either the government or by the Sudan
 
 
 198
 Socialist Union (SSU), Sudan's only legal political party.
 The press is aware it has no constitutional protections,
 however, and is subject to reprisals should it go too
 far. The chief editor of a local daily was jailed briefly
 during the summer for printing an item which angered the
 police. On the other hand, more news concerning opposition
 to the authorities--such as reports of strikes, demonstrations,
 etc.--is appearing in the press, albeit often several days
 after the fact. The respected monthly magazine Sudanow often
 publishes hard-hitting "exposes" of certain national problems,
 and although published only in English, many of its 15,000
 readers are Sudanese.
 Trade unions are allowed to operate. Strikes are illegal,
 but the unions have been to some extent successful in pressur-
 ing the government for increased benefits through strikes or
 threats of strikes.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, and Emigration
 Constitutional guarantees of freedom of movement within the
 country have not yet been restored, but there are no restric-
 tions currently in force. Exit permits are required, but
 there is no policy of restriction of foreign travel or
 emigration, even though the country suffers from a significant
 "brain drain" to oil-rich Gulf and Middle Eastern countries.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 While the Sudanese Socialist Union is the only legal political
 party, during the elections of 1978 the government did allow
 some non-SSU candidates to run for and assume office in the
 People's Assembly. President Nimeiri has now undertaken a
 campaign to restructure and reinvigorate the SSU, ostensibly
 to increase participation at the grass roots and to make the
 party more responsive to the needs of the people. By
 strengthening the party, the government also probably hopes
 to contain criticism from independent elements.
 Elections to the Assembly are normally held every four years.
 With SSU approval, "independents" may run for office. There
 is universal adult suffrage. Although the role of women
 continues to be circumscribed by tradition and custom, there
 are women in the Assembly, as well as in other positions
 throughout the government bureaucracy.
 4. Government Attitudes and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The Department of State knows of no requests made in 1979 for
 outside investigations of the human rights situation in the
 Sudan.
