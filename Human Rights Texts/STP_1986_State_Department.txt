 SAO TOME & PRINCIPE*
 Sao Tome and Principe has been a one-party state since gaining
 independence from Portugal in July 1975. Effective political
 power is concentrated in the Presidency and the party, the
 Movement for the Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe (MLSTP).
 The country is composed of two small islands off the west coast
 of Africa with a total population of about 105,000. At
 independence, Manuel Pinto da Costa, the leader of the
 political party, was chosen President without opposition by the
 party and the Popular Assembly, constitutionally the supreme
 organ of state and highest legislative body. The party
 reconfirmed him for a third 5-year term in September 1985.
 No political opposition is permitted outside the party. Small
 opposition groups in exile in Portugal and Gabon have thus far
 shown no evidence of being able to influence events on the
 islands. There is no known organized political opposition in
 Sao Tome itself. There are approximately 75 Cuban technical
 advisors, and the small Sao Tomean army is reinforced by
 approximately 500 troops from Angola.
 In the past the Government drew heavily on Marxist-Leninist
 principles, stressing state control of the means of
 production. With a deteriorating economic situation, state
 control was reduced and the private sector was strengthened.
 The steady decline in cocoa exports, which account for 90
 percent of Sao Tome's exports, reflected both lower world
 prices and serious management problems on the nationalized
 plantations. Inadequate rainfall since 1983 has further
 reduced the production of all crops, resulting in serious food
 shortages and the need for food assistance from the United
 States and other Western countries. In September 1986, the
 first trilateral development assistance agreement between Sao
 Tome and Principe, Portugal, and the United States was signed.
 The Soviet Union signed an aid agreement, for the purchase of
 Soviet consumer goods, in January 1986.
 There was no known change in the overall human rights situation
 in 1986. Freedoms of speech, press, and assembly are
 circumscribed, but some public criticism of government policies
 is permitted. All news media are under government control. On
 May 23, 1986 Sao Tome and Principe ratified the Organization of
 African Unity Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 No reports of such abuses were received in 1986.
 *There is no American Embassy in Sao Tome. Information on the
 human rights situation is therefore limited.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although some Sao Tomeans were arrested in 1984 and detained
 without trial for public criticism of the Government, there
 have been no reports of similar abuses in 1986. There are
 several opposition politicians living in exile, e.g., former
 Prime Minister Miguel Trovoada, and former Minister of Health
 Carlos da Graca, but the Government has indicated that they are
 free to return.
 There have been no reports of the use of forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution does not address the right to a public trial,
 but there have been instances of public trials of persons
 accused of common crimes in recent years. Criminal trials are
 occasionally reported by the local media. In most cases,
 however, common criminals are given a hearing and are sentenced
 by a judge. To date the only political prisoners given trials
 were those accused of coup-plotting in 1977. In those trials
 and in criminal trials since that time, the accused were
 assigned counsel by the Government. There is no tradition of
 independent defense counsel.
 As of the end of 1986, the Government claimed that it held no
 political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Because of Sao Tome's geographic isolation and its small
 population, the Government does not have a highly intrusive
 security system to detect opposition opinion. However, the
 Government's loosely organized system of informers and its
 monitoring of political activities ensure that potential
 dissidents are identified.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The security services are alert and react quickly to public
 expressions of opposition or dissatisfaction with the
 Government. All Sao Tomean media are government organs. They
 consist of one television station which broadcasts 2 days per
 week; a radio station which carries music, government news
 releases, and instructional programs; and a weekly two-to-four
 page newspaper of government news releases. No public written
 criticism of the Government seems to be tolerated, but oral
 criticism at party-sponsored meetings exists. The only foreign
 wire service items are occasional items from Soviet and Angolan
 sources. Voice of America Portuguese language programs reach
 Sao Tome and are listened to without interference. Sao Tome
 Radio also uses VOA taped music programs.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political assembly and activity are legal only within the
 country's sole political party, the MLSTP. Cultural and social
 organizations require government approval, which is believed to
 be easily obtained.
 The sole trade union, affiliated with the party, exists mainly
 on paper. In 1986 there were several spontaneous strikes and
 
 
 245
 SAO TOME & PRINCIPE
 job actions at cocoa estates. In April, workers from the Santa
 Margarida cocoa estate marched in the center of Sao Tome
 ostensibly to protest a reshuffling of ministers. There is no
 explicit legislation forbidding strikes. There is no
 information currently available on whether collective
 bargaining is legally permitted.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religious freedom is guaranteed by the Constitution. The three
 religious communities--Roman Catholic, Evangelical Protestant,
 and Seventh-Day Adventist--are allowed to practice freely. The
 Government provides some funding for a school and a social
 services center managed by the Catholic Church.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The geographic isolation and poverty of the country severely
 limit foreign travel and emigration. In addition, the
 Government closely controls exit visas for the few people who
 do travel. Almost all trips outside the islands are for
 governmental missions or medical evacuation. Domestic travel
 is not controlled by the Government, and people move freely on
 the islands of Sao Tome and Principe. The lack of reliable and
 affordable air service severely limits interisland travel.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Government policy is determined by President da Costa, in
 consultation with his key cabinet and security officials. The
 leadership uses the MLSTP to consolidate its rule at the local
 level and to assist in selecting candidates for the Popular
 Assembly. In the 1985 elections to the Popular Assembly,
 persons at the local level were allowed, even encouraged, to
 speak out and to give their opinions on various government
 policies. In many districts, the voters rejected the official
 party candidate in favor of another candidate. Party
 membership has been expanded in recent years and now stands at
 about 2,900. Internal security is reinforced by Angolan troops.
 There are small exile groups in Portugal and Gabon. In May
 1986, former Minister of Health Carlos da Graca resigned the
 chairmanship of the National Resistance Front of Sao Tome and
 Principe (FRNSTP) based in Libreville, saying that the recent
 economic liberalization by the Government and its opening to
 moderate African states made his further leadership of the
 FRNSTP unnecessary. Da Graca said he would remain in exile
 until Angolan troops withdrew from the country.
 An incident in 1986 that still remains murky was the arrival in
 a fishing boat at Walvis Bay, Namibia, of 76 young black male
 Sao Tomeans who claimed to belong to the FRNSTP. FRNSTP
 officials in Libreville claimed that these men had been
 expelled from the movement, while the Sao Tome Foreign Minister
 stated that the 76 were not political opponents at all, but
 rather "opportunists."
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 The extent to which the Government is aware of or influenced by
 international human rights organizations is not known.

 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Sao Tome population is relatively homogeneous, and there
 have been no reports of policy, discrimination on a tribal,
 regional, sex, or religious basis among Sao Tomean citizens.
 As energetic outsiders, Cape Verdeans in Sao Tome do suffer
 some informal discrimination.
 Women have constitutional guarantees of equality, and several
 are active in public life. One senior official, the Minister
 of Education and Culture, is a woman, as is the President of
 the Popular Assembly. There are at least two women members of
 the central committee of the party. Cultural factors, rather
 than legal restraints, limit the actual participation of women
 in government.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Legislation requires that a minimum wage of approximately $55
 per month be paid to workers. There are reports that workers
 at several cocoa estates were not paid for several months or
 did not receive the minimum wage for an extended period of
 time. A legal minimum employment age of 18 years is apparently
 observed in practice. Basic occupational health and safety
 standards are contained in the Social Security Law of 1979.
