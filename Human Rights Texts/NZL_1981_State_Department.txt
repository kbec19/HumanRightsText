 NEW ZEALAND
 New Zealand has an exemplary record in the human rights
 field and continues to improve and broaden respect for
 human rights. New Zealand enjoys a firm tradition of
 democracy dating back to its founding in the 19th century.
 Universal suffrage, personal freedom, respect for minority
 rights, rule of law, humane treatment of prisoners, concern
 for the economically deprived, freedom of the press, free
 trade union affiliation and freedom of religion are deeply
 ingrained principles of the society and are fundamental,
 unquestioned tenets in its governance.
 The 1981 tour of New Zealand by the South African Springbok
 rugby team was marked by considerable turbulence on the
 part of groups that wanted the tour cancelled. The New
 Zealand government advised publicly against scheduling
 the tour, in compliance with the Commonwealth Gleneagles
 agreement, but did not deny visas to the South African
 team. Although opposition ostensibly centered on the
 abhorence of apartheid, whether or not the games should
 be staged became an issue of personal freedom within
 New Zealand.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is illegal under a long tradition of common law
 and case precedents. It is not practiced in New Zealand.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatmentor punishment all
 are illegal and not practiced. Capital punishment is
 illegal and summary executions are unknown. Abuse of
 prisoners and use of excessive force by police are not
 condoned and the government has adequate procedures to
 deal with them. Prison and detention facilities provide
 adequate shelter, food, and medical care. Prisoners'
 relatives and lawyers are allowed to visit them. There
 are no differences of treatment of prisoners based on
 social class, race, sex or religion.
 c. Disappearances
 Secret arrests, clandestine detentions and abductions
 are unknown in New Zealand.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There are no political prisoners in New Zealand. Habeas
 corpus exists and is honored in practice. Preventive
 detention does not exist. Following arrest, persons
 must be charged promptly.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The law, which guarantees the right to a fair, public
 trial, is respected. Defendants are entitled to counsel,
 and have free access to their lawyers. Consultations
 between defendants and counsel may be held in private.
 The government does not harass defense counsel. Defendants
 are charged promptly after arrest and charges are stated
 formally and clearly. Under New Zealand's legal system,
 defendants are able to call witnesses, present evidence, and
 cross-examine prosecution witnesses at trials and are not
 subject to double jeopardy. The law of evidence is
 independent of executive or military control. There are
 no special courts to deal with political or security
 offenses. Civilians are not tried by military courts.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Private property can only be searched in conformity with
 the law, which requires a warrant issued by a magistrate.
 Forced entries have not been alleged credibly and no other
 violations of the home have occurred.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These rights are guaranteed by a long tradition of common
 law cases. There is no censorship or control of the media
 by the government apart from legislated exceptions relating
 to pornographic and similar materials and laws against
 defamation. Opposition viewpoints are freely discussed in
 the media. Journalists and academics work unhindered.
 Public meetings are free of restrictions and no one is
 denied the right to assemble freely. Trade union rights
 are respected. Public sector employees generally are not
 prohibited from collective bargaining and striking but
 there are some limited exceptions. Professional groups are
 not harassed. All religions are practiced freely. There
 is no state religion, nor is advantage given to the adherents
 of any particular faith.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There is complete freedom of internal and external travel,
 emigration and repatriation to New Zealand.
 The right of voluntary repatriation is guaranteed.
 New Zealand has been responsive, within the limits of its
 resources, to the resettlement needs of refugees and has
 practiced a liberal asylum policy. All of the refugees
 admitted in the past year have arrived under the Indochina
 Refugee Program. Under that program, records by nationality
 are not kept. From January 1981 until July 1982, New Zealand
 plans to accept 1800 Indochina refugees. The New Zealand
 government and private organizations have been generous in
 assisting the resettlement of refugees.

 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The country has a multi-party parliamentary system.
 Suffrage is universal for persons 18 years of age and older.
 Voting rates are high and participation in political groups
 and organizations is common. Opposition groups have every
 opportunity to voice their opinions and no groups are
 denied political participation or suffrage. Serious
 problems involving nationality, citizenship or stateless-
 ness do not exist.
 Women have legal equality with men and participate freely
 in all phases of New Zealand life. The New Zealand Human
 Rights Commission Act of 1977 prohibited discrimination
 on the basis of sex or marital status in the areas of
 employment, accommodation, education, the provision of
 goods or services and access to public facilities. The
 Equal Pay Act of 1972 provided that a woman must receive
 wages equal to those of a man doing the same or substantially
 similar work for the same employer.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no requests for such investigations.
 New Zealand has ratified a number of United Nations conven-
 tions on human rights including:  (a) The International
 Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; (b) The
 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; and
 (c) The International Convention on the Elimination of All
 Forms of Discrimination. Numerous organizations exist in
 New Zealand to protect human rights and oppose various forms
 of discrimination. Prominent among these are the New Zealand
 Council for Civil Liberties, the Citizens' Association for
 Racial Equality, the New Zealand Chapter of the Inter-
 national Commission of Jurists and the National Organization
 of Women.
 The New Zealand Race Relations Act of 1971 states that it
 is unlawful to discriminate against any person, or any
 relative or associate of any person, because of that person's
 color, race, ethnic, or national origin. The Maoris, the
 original inhabitants of New Zealand, traditionally have
 enjoyed fair and equal treatment under the law and from
 society at large.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 New Zealand has traditionally enjoyed a high standard of
 living in which agriculture is the mainstay of the economy.
 Sharp differences in wealth have been deliberately minimized
 through taxation, resulting in a largely egalitarian society.
 In the last decade, New Zealand has suffered from high
 unemployment, rising inflation, increasing energy costs
 and low wages. The government has had to resort to
 extensive borrowing in order to make up for revenue short-
 falls. The long-term economic outlook, however, is positive.
 
 
 655
 New Zealand has maintained favorable trade balances for the
 past several years. New export industries and diversified
 markets for its agricultural and manufactured products have
 brought increased export earnings and signs of recovery
 should be evident by the mid-1980's when alternative
 sources for energy should have reached the production
 stage.
 As might be expected from the state of development of its
 economy, the citizens of New Zealand enjoy a high and
 healthy standard of living. Per capita GNP in 1979 was
 reported at $5,930. Life expectancy at birth had reached
 73 years, while the infant mortality rate had decreased
 to 14 per 1,000 live births. The nation's population ï¿½
 growth rate for the decade 1970-79 stood at 1.5, with an
 overall fertility rate of 2.2. The adult literacy rate
 was 99 percent, while the adjusted primary school enroll-
 ment figures exceeded 100 per cent for both males and
 females. One hundred percent of the population was
 reported as having access to safe water. There was
 available for the average New Zealander in 1977, 127 per
 cent of nutritional requirements in the supply of calories.
 No portion of the population was considered to have fallen
 below the absolute poverty level.
