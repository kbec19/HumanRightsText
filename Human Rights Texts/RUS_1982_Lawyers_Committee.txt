USSR
The Report on the Soviet Union is very well done. We particularly commend the informative sections on Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Our organizations had criticized the omission of this information from the Country Reports for 1981 and we acknowledge with safisfaction that the Department of State appears to have been sensitive to this criticism and has responded by correcting the deficiency.
Another commendable feature of the Report on the Soviet Union is that, for the most part, it avoids politically motivated exaggeration. We note particularly the brief reference to the pipeline issue in which it is stated simply that "there have been reports of the use of forced labor in at least the preliminary phases of the construction." Properly, no mention is made of the unsupported but widely repeated allegations that political prisoners are among those who have been forced to work on the pipeline. By largely sticking to what is known and documented about human rights abuse in the Soviet Union - which is sufficiently grim - the Report enhances its own credibility.
One sentence with which one might take issue in this respect is the assertion that, "It is difficult to estimate the number of political prisoners in the USSR,
-102-
although 10,000 is generally considered the minimum." Actu-ually, human rights monitors in the Soviet Union and among exiles from the Soviet Union have used the 10,000 figure when they estimate the max imum not the minimum number of political prisoners. The Country Report is accurate, however, when it states that, "The Moscow Helsinki Group, which voluntarily ceased its work on September 8 following the indictment of member Sofia Kalistratova, has reported the names of 700 political prisoners, but believes there are many more."
Aside from the possibility that reference to a "minimum" of 10,000 political prisoners may be an exaggeration, we note an inconsistency with reports on countries considered friendly to the United States. When figures are used with respect to these countries, the practice in the Country Reports is to stick to documented cases. " Estimates representing extrapolations are avoided. There is nothing inherently wrong with providing informed estimates. The fairness of the Country Reports would be enhanced, however, if the practice were consistent.
A couple of additional quibbles about the Report on the Soviet Union:
- it is a mistake to include the "Group to Establish Trust Between the USSR and the USA" among human
-103-
rights monitoring groups. This is a peace group and it has deliberately avoided human rights monitoring since this would be provocative to â€¢Soviet authorities. It has, nevertheless, been subjected to considerable harassment - though not precisely in the ways suggested in the Report. The Report says that "many of its activists were put in prison or psychiatric wards." Actually, one member was imprisoned and one was put in a psychiatric hospital. Several other members were put under house arrest, a practice not mentioned in the Report. Also, inaccurate is the assertion that "five members of the 'Group to Establish Trust between the USSR and the USA' were given permission to emigrate under the implied threat of criminal prosecution if they refused to do so." Actually, one couple was given permission and actually
-104-
emigrated. Another couple was granted permission to emigrate, but this was rescinded at the last minute. If there was an "implied threat of criminal prosecution" this was not clear to the individuals involved. - it is asserted that, "Some sources estimate that up to 1,000 persons may be confined in psychiatric hospitals for political reasons." This statement is hedged sufficiently so that it cannot be said to be inaccurate. Even so, it would have been more responsible to state that it is known that some 150 persons are confined in psychiatric hospitals for political reasons. Again, the estimate is not necessarily wrong, but what is known is appalling enough and such estimates are not generally used in the Country Reports.
Despite these few criticisms, we repeat our view that this is a fine report. The discussions of the conditions of confinement in prison camps, of the practice of

internal exile, and of the methods of suppressing spee assembly, travel and worship are all highly commendabl
