 SLOVENIA
 Slovenia is a parliamentary democracy and constitutional republic which declared
 its independence from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1991. Power
 is shared between a directly elected President, a Prime Minister, and a bicameral
 legislature. The third multiparty general elections since independence held in No-
 vember represent a further consolidation of a vigorous, open, and democratic sys-
 tem. Constitutional provisions for an independent judiciary are respected by the
 Government in practice.
 The police are under the effective civilian control of the Ministry of the Interior.
 By law, the armed forces do not exercise civil police functions.
 The country has made steady progress toward developing a market economy. Pri-
 vatization continues, and trade has been reoriented to the-West. Manufacturing ac-
 counts for most employment; machinery and other manufactured products are the
 major exports. Unenployment remained a concern. Inflation continued to decline;
 real growth slowed to 3.5 percent in 1995 and was expected to decline to 3 percent
 in 1996. The currency is stable, fully convertible, and backed by substantial re-
 serves. The economy provides citizens with a good standard of living.
 The Government fully respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and
 judiciary provide adequate means of dealing with individual instances of abuse. An
 Ombudsman deals with human rights problems, including citizenship cases. About
 12 percent of the population is composed of minorities, most of whom are nationals
 of the former Yugoslavia. The Hungarian and Italian ethnic communities (under 1
 percent) enjoy constitutionally provided representation in the National Assembly.
 Minorities are generally treated fairly in practice.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and inhuman treatment as well as "humiliating
 punishment or treatment," and there were no reports of such treatment.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards and were not the sub-
 ject of complaint by an human rights organization.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, deprivation of liberty, and the use of exile. The detaining authority must ad-
 vise the detainee in writing within 24 hours, in his own language, of the reasons
 for his arrest. The law also provides safeguards against self-incrimination.
 The Constitution also spells out the rights of detainees and limits on the Govern-
 ment's power to hold them (3 months maximum, with right of appeal). These rights
 and limitations are fully respected in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.
 The judicial system comprises local and district courts, with the Supreme Court
 as the highest court. Judges, elected by the State Assembly (parliament) on the
 nomination of the Judicial-Council, are constitutionally independent and serve in-
 definitely, subject to an age limit. The Judicial Council is composed of six sitting
 judges elected by their peers and five presidential nominees elected by the State As-
 senibly. The nine-member Constitutional Court rules on the constitutionality of leg-
 islation.
 The Constitution provides in great detail for the right to a fair trial, including
 provisions for. Equality before the law, presumption of innocence, due process, open
 court proceedings, guarantees of appeal, and a prohibition against double jeopaidy.

 These rights are respected in practice, although the judicial system is so burdened
 that justice is frequently a protracted process.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Corespondence.-The
 Constitution provides protection for privacy, "personal data rights,' and the invio-
 lability of the home, mail, and other means of communication. These rights and pro-
 tections are respected in practice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of
 thought speech, public association, the press, and other forms of public communica-
 tion and expression. Lingering self-censorship and some indirect political pressures
 continue to influence the media.
 The press is now a vigorous institution emerging from its more restricted past.
 The media span the political spectrum. The major media do not represent a broad
 range of ethnic interests, although there is an Italian-language television channel
 as well as a newspaper available to the ethnic Italian minority who live on the Adri-
 atic Coast. Hungarian radio programming is common in the northeast where there
 are about 10,000 ethnic Hungarians. Bosnian refugees and the Albanian community
 have newsletters in their own languages.
 Six major daily and several weekly newspapers are published. The major print
 media are supported through private investment and advertising, although the na-
 tional broadcaster, RTV Slovenia, enjoys government subsidies, as do cultural publi-
 cations and book publishing. There are five television channels, two of them inde-
 pendent private stations. Numerous foreign broadcasts are available via satellite
 and cable. All major towns have radio stations and cable television. Numerous busi-
 ness and academic journals and publications are available. Foreign newspapers,
 magazines, and journals are widely available.
 In theory and practice, the media enjoy full freedom in their journalistic pursuits.
 However, for over 40 years Slovenia was ruled by an authoritarian Communist po-
 litical system, and reporting about domestic politics may be influenced to some de-
 gree b self-censorship and rndirect political pressures.
 In           a ournalist from the Marior daily, Vecer, came under direct pres-
 sure from the Government when the Defense Ministry accused him of revealing
 state secrets as a result of his reporting on ministry procurement practices. The In-
 terior Ministry searched his home and confiscated documents. While these measures
 were undertaken with strict observance of the law, they may have a chilling effect
 onpress overage of sensitive government issues.
 The election law requires the media to offer free space and time to political par-
 ties at election time. During the recent general election, television stations offered
 viewers a host of public-interest and debate programs featuring party figures and
 opinion-maker from the entire political spectrum.
 The Constitution provides for autonomy and freedom for universities and other in-
 stitutions of higher education. There are two universities, each with numerous afl-
 ated research and study institutions. Academic freedom is respected, and centers of
 hi     education are lively and intellectually stimulatin Cp
 b. reeomof Peaceful Assembly and   gsoito.-h          osiuinpoie          o
 the rights of peaceful assembly, association, and participation in public meetings
 and the Government respects these rights in practice. These rights can be restricted
 only in cir.umstancs involv      national security, public safety, or protection
 against infectious diseases, and ten only by act of the National Assembly.
 c. Freedom of Religio-The Constitution explicitly provides for the unfettered
 prfesion of religious and other beliefs in private and in public, and the Govern-
 ment respects these rights in practice. No person can be compelled to admit his reli-
 gious or other beliefs. There is no state religion. About 70 percent of the ppulation
 adheres to the Roman Catholic faith, and 2.5 percent to the Orthodox. There are
 also Protestant congregations, especially in the eastern part of the country. Clergy,
 missionaries-some from abrad--churches, and religious groups operate without
 hindrance.
 The appropriate role for religious instruction in the schools continues to be an
 issue of debate. The Constitution states that parents are entitled to give their chil-
 dren a moral and religious upringing.      Before 1945 religion was much moere
 prominent in the schools, but now only those schools supported by religious bodies
 teach religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Eriation, and Re-
 paoriation.-The Constitution provides that each person has the right to freedom of
 movement, to choice of place of residence, to leave the country freely, and to return.
 Limitations on these rights may be made only by statute and only where necessary

 in criminal cases, to control infectious disease, or in wartime. In practice, citizens
 travel widely and often.
 The Constitution provides for a right of political asylum for foreigners and state-
 less persons "who are persecuted for their stand on human rights and fundamental
 freedoms." The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organization in assisting refu-
 gees. It also provides first asylum and extended it to approximately 2,500 refugees
 (primarily from Bosnia) in 1996. There were no reports of forced expulsion of those
 haig a valid claim to refugee status. Since 1991 Slovenia has  ken in refugees
 from the fighting in Croatia and especially Bosnia-Herzegovina, and has dealt with
 them humanely. There are some 16,000 in the country, about 10,500 of them reg-
 istered.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government, voting by secret ballot on the
 basis of universal suffrage. Of the 31 parties legally registered, 23 contested seats
 in the National Assembly in the November elections, which were conducted peace-
 fully, without allegations of fraud. Slovenia has a mixed parliamentary and presi-
 dential system. The President proposes a candidate to the legislature for confirma-
 tion as Prime Minister, after consultations with the leaders of the political parties
 in the National Assembly.
 The Constitution stipulates that the Italian and Hungarian ethnic communities
 are each entitled to at least one representative in the Assembly, regardless of their
 ppulation.
 ere are no restrictions on the participation of women or minorities in politics.
 The Prime Minister's office has an active agency for monitoring and promoting par-
 ticipation by women in public life.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Independent human rights monitoring groups promote respect for human rights
 and freedoms and freely investigate complaints about violations. The Government
 places no obstacles in the way of investigations by international or local human
 rights groups. The United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) in 1994 de-
 leted Slovenia from the grnup of Yugoslav successor states monitored by the
 UNHRC for human rights abuses.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equality before the law, and that is observed in
 practice. The population (excluding refugees) is approximately 2 million, of which
 1,727,018 are Slovenes and the remainder persons of 23 other nationalities. There
 are 54,212 Croats, 47,911 Serbs, 26,842 Muslims, 8,503 Hungarians, and 3,064 Ital-
 ians.
 The Constitution provides special rights for the "autochthonous Italian and Hun-
 garian ethnic communities3, including the right to use their own national symbols,
 enjoy bilingual education, and other privileges. It also provides for special status
 and rights or the small Romani communities, which are observed in practice.
 Woen.-In general, the level of personal crime and violence is relatively low. The
 problem of spousal abuse and violence against women exists, and police are not re-
 luctant to intervene in such cases. Crimes of abuse against women are dealt with
 in accordance with the Penal Code; there is no special legislation on crimes against
 women.
 Equal rights for women are a matter of state policy. There is no official discrimi-
 nation against women or minorities in housing, jobs, education, or other walks of
 life. Marriage, under the Constitution, is based on the equality of both spouses. The
 Constitution stipulates that the State shall protect the family, motherhood, and fa-
 therhood.
 In rural areas women, even those employed outside the home, bear a dispropor-
 tionate share of household work and family care because of a generally conservative
 social tradition. However, women are frequently encountered in business and in gov-
 ernment executive departments.
 Equal pay for equal work for men and women is the norm. Slovenia has gradually
 but steadily increased employment, although the unemployment rate is 13 percent.
 In such conditions, men and women both suffer from the loss of work. Both sexes
 have the same average period of unemployment. Women, however, still are found
 more often in lower paying jobs.

 Children.-The Constitution stipulates that children "enjoy human rights and
 fundamental freedoms consistent with their age and level of maturity." Moreover,
 they are guaranteed special protection from exploitation and maltreatment.
 The Government demonstrates its commitment to children's welfare through its
 system of public education and health care. There is no societal pattern of abuse
 against children.
 People With Disabilities.-The disabled are not discriminated against, and the
 Government has taken steps to facilitate access to social and economic opportuni-
 ties. In practice, modifications of public and private structures to ease access by the
 handicapped continue slowly but steadily.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution stipulates that trade unions, their
 operation, and their membership shall be free, and provides for the right to strike.
 Virtually all workers, except for the police and military, are eligible to form andjoin
 labor organizations. In 1993 the National Assembly for the first time passed legisla-
 tion restricting strikes by some public sector employees. However, in the wake of
 government budget-cutting, some public sector professiona (judges, doctors, and
 educators) have beome increasingly, active on the labor front.
 � Labor has two main groupings, with constituent branches thr ughyout the cuntry.
 A third, much smaller, regonal labor unon operates on he Adatic coast. Unions
 are formally and actually mdependent of Government and   litical parties, but indi-
 vidual union members hold positions in the legislature  e   onstitution provides
 that the State shall be responsible for "the creation of opportunities for employment
 and for work.'
 There are no restrictions on joining or forming federations and afliliating with
 like-minded international union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The economy is in transition
 from the former Communist system, which included some private ownership of en-
 terprises along with state-controlled and "socially-owned" enterprises. In the transi-
 tion to a fully market-based economy, the collective bargaining process is under-
 going change. Formerly, the old Yugoslav Government had a dominant role in set-
 ting the minimum wage and conditions of work. The Government still exercises this
 role, to an extent, although in the private sector wages and working conditions are
 agreed annually in a general collective agreement between the "social partners;" the
 labor unions and the Chamber of Economy. There are no reports of antiunion dis-
 crimination.
 Export processing zones have been established in Koper, Maribor, and Nova
 Gorica. Worker rights are the same in these zones as in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There is no forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 16 years. Children must remain in school until age 15. During the harvest or for
 other farm work, younger children do work. In general, urban employers respect the
 age limits.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage is approximately $408 (Sit
 55,061) per month, which provides a decent standard of li   or a worker and fam-
 ily. The workweek is 40 hours. In general, businesses provide acceptable conditions
 of work for their employees. Occupational health and safety standards are set and
 enforced by special commissions controlled by the Ministries of Health and Labor.
 Workers have the right to remove themselves from unsafe conditions without jeop-
 ardizing their continued employment.
