MALAYSIA
The government of Mahathir Mohamed, beginning his third decade as
prime minister, continued to crack down hard on potential political challengers,
arresting key opposition leaders, banning political rallies, and breaking up
public gatherings with force.
The year began with the prime minister’s popularity in decline. In November
2000, the ruling coalition suffered a by-election defeat in Mahathir’s home district
in Kedah state and the government faced increasingly vocal opposition protests. In
response, it turned the draconian Internal Security Act (ISA) against its political
opponents.Among those targeted under the ISA,which allows detainees to be held
indefinitely without charge or public airing of the evidence against them, were
minority Shi’a Muslims, supporters of jailed former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim, and youth leaders in the opposition PAS (Partai Islam Se-Malaysia) party,
although individuals linked to specific violent acts were also among those detained.
In the wake of the September 11 attacks in the United States, authorities used global
concern with terrorism to justify their actions.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPMENTS
The government detained six Shi’a Muslims under the ISA between October
2000 and January 2001, three of whom reportedly were still being held in November.
Other ISA detentions of Shi’a Muslims in previous years were said by government
officials to be necessary to prevent “religious disharmony” that could damage
the nation’s political and economic development.
On November 5, 2000, police punched and kicked participants at a peaceful
demonstration outside the city of Klang, fired tear gas and water cannons, and
arrested 126 people demonstrating in support of Anwar Ibrahim.The National Justice
Party (Partai Keadilan Nasional or Keadilan), founded by Anwar’s wife,Wan
Azizah, had applied for but been denied a permit to hold the demonstration.
In January, nine government opponents were arrested and charged with rioting
in the run-up to the November 2000 by-election in Kedah. The nine were accused
of trying to prevent busloads of supporters of the ruling coalition (Barisan
Nasional), whom they believed were traveling to the area to vote illegally, from
reaching the polls.
In January,police also forcibly prevented political speeches and stopped cultural
displays at a multi-cultural festival organized by the opposition, despite having
issued a permit for the festival. Police also stopped a book launch party at a restaurant
attended by more than 1,000 former Labour Party members. The book was a
historical account of the leftist party disbanded three decades ago.
In February, police arrested four protestors, including Keadilan Vice-President
Tian Chua and columnist/filmmaker Hishammuddin Rais, at a demonstration calling for former Attorney General Mohtar Abdullah to be for abuse of power in
conducting the prosecution of Anwar. On February 14, police used tear gas and
water cannons to disperse 15,000 to 20,000 people at a Keadilan political rally in
Kampung Lahar, held on private property. Police had refused to grant a permit for
the rally.
On February 9, Marina Yusoff, former vice president of Keadilan, was fined
5,000 ringgit (approximately U.S. $1,315) for asserting in a speech in September
2000 that the ruling coalition had sparked anti-Chinese riots in 1969 following a
local election defeat. On March 5, Keadilan youth leader Mohamed Ezam
Mohamed Nor was arrested and subsequently charged with sedition for remarks
published in Mingguan Malaysia newspaper in which he reportedly stated that he
would continue leading street demonstrations until the government was brought
down.On March 6, police arrested nine people who held a candlelight vigil for him
outside a police station. Ezam was released on bail on March 13, but, as described
below, was subsequently rearrested less than a month later under the ISA.
Ethnic violence broke out on March 9 when ethnic Indians and Malays clashed
in Kampung Medan, a poor quarter of Kuala Lumpur. Police reported that six
people, including five of Indian origin, were killed and over fifty injured.Most of
the wounded were also ethnic Indians. Four opposition party leaders jointly challenged
the official casualty figures, suggesting the actual figures were higher: in
response, the government threatened to charge them with sedition, though no
charges were ultimately brought. Indian community representatives continued to
demand further investigation.
On April 10-11, just days before public protests planned to mark the second
anniversary of the sentencing of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim,
the authorities detained seven opposition leaders under the ISA, then three other
people in the following days. Most of the ten, who were all held incommunicado
until May 4,were members of Keadilan.The authorities alleged that they were plotting
to overthrow the government but produced no evidence to substantiate this.
On May 30, in an unusual and courageous ruling Judge Hishamuddin Yunus
ordered the release of two ISA detainees on a writ of habeas corpus, and suggested
that the parliament should review and either scrap or amend the ISA to reduce its
potential for abuse. By mid-November, authorities had released three more
detainees, but five had been served with two-year detention orders and were being
held at the Kamunting Detention Centre. The five are: Tian Chua, Ezam Mohamed
Noor,Hishammuddin Rais, Saari Sungib, and Lokman Nor.
In July, the authorities detained two student activists, Khairul Anuar Ahmad
Zainuddin and Mohamad Fuad Mohamad Ikhwan, under the ISA, the former for
twenty three days and the latter for ten days.
Also in July, the government banned all political rallies stating that they would
undermine the country’s security. When PAS subsequently planned a series of
meetings to protest the policy, police refused to grant permits and dispersed those
who attempted to attend. On August 2-4, police arrested an additional ten people
under the ISA, all of whom were affiliated with or supporters of PAS, including four
prominent youth leaders. The authorities said the ten belonged to a group that
planned to overthrow the government, sometimes labeling the group the Malaysian Militant Group and sometimes the Malaysian Mojahedin Group. One of those
detained, Nik Adli Nik Aziz, was the son of a leading PAS official. The authorities
alleged he had received military training in Afghanistan and had learned bomb
making from Muslim rebels in the Philippines, but he denied this and PAS leaders
emphasized that they used only peaceful, democratic means in their struggle
against the ruling coalition.As of mid-November, nine of the ten remained in custody
after being served two-year detention orders.
Four days after the September 11 attacks in the United States, Deputy Prime
Minister Abdullah Ahman Badawi sought to justify the ISA as providing “an initial
preventive measure before threats get beyond control,” and on October 10 two
other alleged members of the Malaysian Mojahedin Group were detained under the
act. PAS leaders, however, dismissed the detentions as a “political ploy” and challenged
the government to bring charges and produce the detainees in open court.
The government maintained important restrictions on press freedom. Under
the Printing Presses and Publications Act, newspapers were required annually to
obtain licenses to publish from the government and those held to have breached the
terms of their license could be restricted or shut down. The PAS organ Harakah,
formerly a biweekly publication, continued to be restricted to two issues per month
for allegedly breaching the terms of its license in 2000 by selling to non-PAS members.
In March, editions of both Far Eastern Economic Review and Asiaweek, which
had been chronicling the growing opposition to Mahathir and signs of political
unrest, were held back by government censors.Mahathir had complained that the
photo of him on the cover of an earlier edition of Asiaweek had made him look like
“an idiot.”
Authorities also appeared to be struggling for a way to rein in independent Internet
daily malaysiakini.com, winner of an International Press Institute 2001 Press
Freedom Award. As part of its effort to promote Malaysia’s multimedia corridor,
the government had promised there would be no Internet censorship, and Internet
sites were exempt from media licensing provisions. Early in the year, ministers
accused malaysiakini.com of receiving funds via a Bangkok press group from financier
George Soros, long pilloried in the government-controlled Malaysian press
as personally responsible for the Asian economic crisis in 1997. On February 11, an
information ministry official said that malaysiakini.com would be barred from
covering government press conferences “because their credibility is doubtful.” On
May 23, the deputy home affairs minister told parliament that the government was
monitoring “every article” published by malaysiakini.com to ensure that its writings
did not upset public order.
The threat of multimillion dollar libel awards against journalists and media
publications, said to be the highest such awards among the fifty-four countries of
the Commonwealth, also continued to limit press freedom.A Bar Council publication
in March noted that, since businessman and one-time Mahathir insider Vincent
Tan won a 10 million Ringgit (approximately U.S. $2.2 million) judgment
against a group of media defendants in 1994,more than seventy libel cases had been
filed against journalists and media defendants, many seeking millions of dollars in
damages.
Serious questions remained about the independence of the judiciary. In March, the Kuala Lumpur Bar Committee issued a memorandum concluding that “the
administration of justice in Malaysia is in its darkest hour since independence.”By
early November, however, a number of developments suggested that the appointment
in December 2000 of respected jurist Dzaiddin Abdullah as chief justice was
beginning to have a positive impact. On March 15, former police chief Abdul
Rahim Noor was sentenced for the prison beating of Anwar Ibrahim, though only
to a two-month term. In June, a federal court dismissed contempt charges that had
been laid against Anwar’s lawyer, Zainur Zakaria, when he petitioned for the
removal of two of the prosecutors during Anwar’s trial. The May 30 decision of
Judge Hishamuddin Yunus to order the release of two ISA detainees was also a powerful
reassertion of judicial independence.
In another important decision on June 8, high court judge Muhammad Kamil
Awang overturned the results of the March 1999 state elections in Likas (Sabah)
after finding that the electoral roll included nonexistent voters. (Sabah’s three million
population includes an estimated 500,000 immigrants, mostly from neighboring
Indonesia and the Philippines). The judge also sparked a police investigation
into improper judicial interference when he disclosed that one of his superiors had
ordered him in 1999 to dismiss the case.
On October 16, prominent human rights lawyer Karpal Singh was put on trial
for sedition for comments he had made in January 2000 while lead defense counsel
for Anwar Ibrahim. Following reports that increased levels of arsenic had been
found in Anwar’s blood, Singh had suggested in court that “people in high places”
were trying to poison his client.He faced up to three years in jail if convicted.
It was a difficult year for migrant workers. In May, the government announced
plans to expel 100,000 illegal migrant workers. Government figures showed that
50,953 illegal immigrants were detained in nationwide operations between January
and the end of June. In August, the government announced plans to amend the
Immigration Act to punish illegal migrant workers and employers who engage
them with imprisonment and caning. Officials justified the measures as necessary
to stem the influx of illegal migrants, who they blamed for an increase in serious
crime.
DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
Human rights groups continued to play a critical role in investigating and publicizing
abuses. In response to the increased use of the ISA, rights groups such as
Aliran,Hakam, and Suaram (Suara Rakyat Malaysia) helped form a new umbrella
organization called AIM (Abolish ISA Movement), which campaigned actively on
behalf of detainees’ rights and for repeal of the law. Some human rights workers
were among those detained: Badaruddin Ismail (also known as Pak Din), a member
of Suaram’s secretariat, was among those detained under the ISA. He was
released on June 5.
With the government still exerting substantial control over major media outlets,
Malaysia’s alternative media and rights groups were also important sources of independent
information about human rights and related developments.
Malaysia’s national human rights commission (Suhakam), established by the
government in late 1999, also began to speak out more forcefully, though its performance
was uneven. It called for review of the ISA and urged the government,
unsuccessfully, to allow Anwar to travel to Germany for surgery for back injuries
that he apparently sustained as a result of being beaten in custody. In early August,
Suhakam criticized the police in a report on freedom of assembly.The commission
said police had refused to grant permits for public gatherings without adequate justification,
and had given protestors insufficient time to disperse and used excessive
force against them. It called for amendment of the Police Act to remove the police
permit system and require only that police be given advance notice of an assembly,
to provide that any conditions should not restrict free expression, and to require the
police to exercise restraint in dispersing demonstrators. The commission also recommended
amendment of the Public Order (Preservation) Act 1958,which it said
unduly restricted freedom of assembly. Later in August, Suhakam published the
results of its five-month inquiry into police conduct in connection with the
November 2000 Keadilan-sponsored rally near Klang.The commission accused the
police of using excessive force in crowd control and in the arrest and treatment of
detainees. The government said it would study Suhakam’s findings and recommendations.
The trial of Irene Fernandez, head of Tenaganita (Women’s Force), already the
longest trial in Malaysian history, entered its sixth year. Fernandez faced three years
in prison if convicted on charges of malicious publishing for her July 1995 memorandum
on abuses in immigration detention centers. Several former detainees testified
in 2001, corroborating allegations in the report of the existence of torture and
sexual abuse in the camps.
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
The continuing crackdown in Malaysia evoked little international response
either in the region, including from Japan, the country’s largest bilateral aid donor
and one of its most important investors, or from Western governments.
In April 2001, Foreign Minister Syed Hamid complained when a dozen foreign
Malaysia-based diplomats attended a private briefing by Wan Azizah on the health
of her husband, Anwar Ibrahim. The minister said he would summon the diplomats
and explain to them “the actual political situation” in Malaysia.
The Bush administration shifted its position on Malaysia following the September
11 attacks. In late June, Wan Azizah visited Washington and met senior U.S.
State Department officials and members of Congress. A few weeks later, Syed met
with U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell and was reportedly told that a meeting
between President Bush and Prime Minister Mahathir could take place only if there
were progress on Anwar’s case and in the treatment of political dissidents.However,
when Mahathir and Bush met at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
summit in Shanghai in late October, Bush reportedly made no public comment on
Malaysia’s human rights record.
